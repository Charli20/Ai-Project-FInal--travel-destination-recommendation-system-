This place stands as a powerful reminder of courage, sacrifice, and the high price paid for peace in Sri Lanka. Seeing the remains of the bulldozer and learning about the bravery displayed during that historic moment gave us a profound sense of respect and gratitude for the soldiers who defended the nation. The site is simple yet impactful, allowing visitors to reflect quietly on the events that took place. It is well worth visiting for anyone interested in Sri Lankan history, especially those who wish to understand the realities faced during the conflict years. A visit here is not just sightseeing—it is a moment of remembrance and appreciation. Highly recommended for those traveling through Elephant Pass.","January 2, 2026"

But this monument is a reminder that Sri Lanka is one country again and that the army, navy and airforce all played a role in achieving the eventual resolution which pushed the LTTE out. Much of the countryside around the monument has been cleared, to ensure there was no cover for the armies. After heavy bloodshed this is a reminder of the essential nature of peace and unity.

This history is marked by 2 interesting memorials on opposite sides of the road (but a short distance part). The first (on the left going north on the A9) is a memorial to 26 year old Corporal Gamini Kularathna who had the presence of mind to use grenades to stop the advance of an armour plated bulldozer (present on site) heavily laden with explosives. He gave his own life to save many of his comrades. There is a statue of Gamini with the bulldozer in front and a nearby exhibition space with lots of photographs, personal letters and other documents. Nearby is the recently rebuilt Elephant Pass station. Looking at the timetable, and the interval between trains, it is difficult to see who would actually use the station. All part of the civil war and reconciliation effort. Further up the A9 on the right is a 2nd 'reconciliation' monument which marks the resumption of free movement between north and south. The symbolism of various parts of the monument, including plant species from north and south, is explained in a series of plaques. This is very recent history and it is noticeable that many Sri Lankans are visiting the Jaffna peninsular and a part of their country which for many years was out of bounds. It is a world away from the Cultural Triangle, Hill Country and beautiful beaches but for a complete look at Sri Lanka should not be missed.","July 12, 2017"

Having heard so much about this area during the troubles we were surprised at how the scenery is so very different from how we imagined. Great expanse of sandy areas and then the lagoon on one side and the Bay of Bengal on the other. Sad to think of the loss of life in this area but rejoice that the troubles are now over, However as UK tourists we were more than surprised that near Omantai we had to go through a military check point and produce our pass ports which they photocopied. This in a country that has been finished with war 4years, We also had to get out of our vehicle and produce our passports on leaving the area two days later. Not the most comfortable feeling to get visitors to the North. I don't think that this area can be rated in a way that you can rate a hotel etc, so hence the average rating","September 22, 2013"

Portugese followed by Dutch and then British occupied this strategic area and it witnesses several severe episodes of the Sri Lankan civil war.

There is a lot of war related literature with ""Elephant Pass"" as the name.  There is a book named ""The Road from Elephant Pass"". This area has a salt lake and I think that it is currently not in use. A lot of battles have taken place in this area. Once an LTTE truck had come with explosives with the intention of driving directly into the army camp which was situated at Elephant Pass and one soldier named ""Gamini"" (who later came to be known with the name of his village as ""Hasalaka Gamini) has run towards the truck with explosives in his hand and blasted the truck thereby saving all the lives of the soldiers inside the camp. His pictures, a description of the incident and the remains of the LTTE truck are still there to be seen around this area.","December 1, 2012"
