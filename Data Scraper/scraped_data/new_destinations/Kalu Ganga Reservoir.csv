If you take a road trip down Rattota - Illukkumbura - Hettipola road you come across Bambarakiri ella, Riverston, Pitawala Pathana, Sera Ella, Thelgamu Oya and the newest addition is Kalu Ganga reservoir. It has scenic views and once we went there found out that there is one insta famous spot where you take a pic on seated on the middle of the road with a particular mountain as backdrop (not sure what it was, could be Lakegala). Once you pass the reservoir you can go all the way to Girandurukotte crossing the new bridge over Mahaweli river or you can go down to Hasalaka from Hettipola. Sadly the road from Raththota almost upto the reservoir offers a rather bumpy ride. The road is not terrible per se, but it's not a particularly comfortable ride either.....","August 3, 2024"
