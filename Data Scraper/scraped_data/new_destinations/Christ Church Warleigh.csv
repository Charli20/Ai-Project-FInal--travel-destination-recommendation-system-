Our group leader, Padmini, had pre-arranged and obtained permission to enter the compound and to be shown around this quaint little church. This Church built by the British in 1878 is one of the oldest and prominent Anglican churches in Sri Lanka.  It had been built with granite stone blocks now looking ash coloured.  The Church is scenically located surrounded by tea estates and borders the Castlereigh lake.  The caretaker and sexton Mr Felix Coulton welcomed us, took us in and described its history.  Many tombstones of British Planters lie at the cemetery surrounding the church. A bible printed around 1865 and presented to the church in 1879 occupies the pride of place near the pulpit.  The stained-glass windows, with Jesus paintings, are attractive and livens the church interior.  An old ancient church organ adorns the entrance.  Wooden church benches and the pulpit too appear ancient.  Floral tiles, imported from England, are laid out on the floor. We greatly enjoyed the visit to this church located in picture-postcard surrounds.  Here, I felt a feeling of nostalgia of what it would have been!","April 5, 2021"

It is a very peaceful setting with fabulous views over the waters of Castlereigh Reservoir. The church has lovely stained glass windows, carved wood alter and pulpit as well as a very old organ that is still in use. This beautiful church has a special place in my heart because my great grandfather is buried there. Robert Calhoun Grant was from Scotland, became a tea planter in Sri Lanka and probably went to Warleigh Church most Sundays. He died in January 1915 and is among many other British people in that churchyard who have contributed to the growth of Ceylon Tea!","November 3, 2016"

We were the only visitors on a cloudy day, but that didnt dampen the beauty of the tiny church. The original bible that was gifted to the church is still lovingly kept at the alter. It is a great place to find out about your ancestors, if they were posted in Sri Lanka during the time of the British! There is a large pipe organ at the back and a tiny organ in the front of the church. We spent more than 30min inside the premises (the church door was locked) and on our way out, the caretaker, who had been alerted by his wife, met us looking not too pleased! He made an excuse to open the church door, but we convinced him to! He went on about the fact that there are rogues in the area and that they are very careful who should come visit! His negative chatter distracted us, so much so that we couldnt ask whether there were any prominent people buried there! I wonder if the welcome would have been any different, if we were foreigners!
