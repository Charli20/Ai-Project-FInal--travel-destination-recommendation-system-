Very limited on information. Lucky we found some locals at Priyanthanee Hotel where we stayed. I don’t know local language but I can just say the things I had seen. First off, didn’t see any jeeps out front. This place is not commercialized at all. Actually we were the only ones in the whole park, on Sunday. We seen so many animals though. Wow. Incredible time today in the wildlife safria of Tanamalwila, Sir Lanka. Seen today about 100 birds, monkeys of course, elephants, deer, crocs, lizards, many peacocks, foxes and so much more. Will make a video on it soon so stay in touch on my YouTube. Epic! Forest Destine So if coming here I highly recommend finding a hotel to help you or take your time coming here. You might have to question things all day long even before you can find a Jeep, driver and even a ranger as a guide. But we seen so much. It was truly an amazing experience.","January 13, 2020"

Landscape is really nice and varying...but wet season would be the best to visit as many jeeps were inside as Yala was closed. And visit in early morning which will give you more beautiful scenery.","January 26, 2017"

If a leopard is sighted it is bedlam. This was much more authentic. Less numbers of animals but they all seemed more active and we got to get into the forest on small trails. We had close encounters with 2 leopards and with elephants. We saw crocodiles in action and eagles and other birds as well as herds of deer. A great afternoon.,"January 6, 2017"

And we were the first lot to drive through one of their newly opened track. New gate is just 30 to 40 mins drive from Thissamaharama town. You have to take A2 highway towards lunugamvehera town and Turn Right to Lunugamvehera reservoir at L'vehera town. Drive all the way to the end till you reach the park entrance and ticket office. You will at least need a good 5 to 6hrs to roam around the entire park. More time the better. 6am to 6pm is the park open time.

You can observe large groups of Spotted deer, Buffaloes and Sambur. You can have a rest on Weheragala Dam and that place is really beautiful place to be. Also you can hire a safari jeep for a tour as well. if you use your own vehicle, it should be 4x4 and should have high ground clearance.","February 9, 2016"

We took the afternoon trip and was greeted by both an elephant and monkeys just at the entrance of the park which perked up our day. During the next 3 hours we saw lots of black faced monkeys ( whose scientific name I've forgotten ), many peacocks and peahens, spotted dears, iguanas, many species of birds including the pelicans, toucans, kingfishers, stocks, parakeets, white bald eagles, water buffaloes but just 2 elephants. We also visited the Lunugamvehera Reservoir. Overall it was a good safari , many thanks to our wonderful guide Sri Sanjeevan and our driver Rohan. We find the Park average mainly because in Malaysia, we too have many of the animals spotted in the park. Yala and its leopards would be better but then again maybe I'm biased. Thanks again to Sri and Rohan.","October 10, 2015"

This area is adjoining the Yala block 5 which most of the tourist are not being taken to and the animals of the Yala stage 5 move into this area pretty often. As per the experience of the local person he has spotted 2 leopards during another visit and that was during evening. But during my visit I did not sight any leopards.
