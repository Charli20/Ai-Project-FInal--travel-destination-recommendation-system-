While the vendors are generally good and helpful people, I had the bad experience of being sold rotten fruit from a particular lady so be careful when dealing with people. Overall it is worth walking around here and if you're a foodie there's plenty of street carts selling crispy vadai (savory snack made from lentils) and roti.","October 23, 2015"

Jaffna market is also close to Jaffna bus stand(station). From here, you can take a very cheap (CTB -- big,red, state-run buses) bus to Kayts, along the causeway which runs across the lagoon from Jaffna city/town to Kayts island. If you are in the least interested in bird-watching or sea/landscape, this is a journey not to be missed. The causeway is about 3/4 miles long ( and unfortunately at the moment, sections are being rebuilt - not that that deters the bus traffic at all) and on both sides there are marvellous birds everywhere-- especially during Dec-March period when the migrants fly in from the steppes. I saw brahmini kites hunting for fish; painted storks; the grey and the other heron; a flock of spoonbills paddling for small fish followed by baby cormorants picking up the remnants; and the clarity of the January light was marvellous .You need to go early morning before the sun climbs too high and flattens everything or just before dusk, when the sun lies low in the sky.","February 1, 2015"

According to the chronicles, in the 5th year after enlightenment, Lord Buddha visited Nagadipa to settle a dispute between two Nàga Kings - Chulodara and Mahodara regarding a gem studded throne. The Buddha preached the virtues of non-violence to the warring factions. He urged them to forget hating each other and be united. The two kings surrounded by their followers listened patiently to the Buddha and decided to end their enmity. After the two warring kings made peace the throne was offered to the Buddha, who returned it to the Naga kings. It was later enshrined in the Nagadipa Stupa and soon became a place of Buddhist veneration. Nagadipa later came to be referred to as Nainativu island with the settlement of Tamils in the island.","September 14, 2014"
