The temple is beautifully located by the Kalu River, and the huge white stupa looks amazing from the main road. What makes it special is that you can actually go inside the stupa and see lovely wall paintings that tell Buddhist stories. As a couple, we really enjoyed the calm and spiritual atmosphere it was a nice break from the beach and the traffic. We sat quietly for a few minutes just taking in the surroundings and watching locals bring flowers and offerings. dress modestly, remove your shoes before entering, and only give donations at the official box. There were a few people near the entrance offering “tours” for money, but it’s best to politely decline. We went around 4:30 pm, and the light was beautiful for photos, especially with the river and sunset in the background. Highly recommend a short visit if you’re passing through Kalutara peaceful, cultural, and a lovely shared moment for couples.","November 4, 2025"

This sacred Buddhist temple is built around one of the 32 saplings of the original Sri Maha Bodhi tree in Anuradhapura, making it a very important site for local worshippers. The white stupa (dagoba) is unique because you can actually walk inside it, which is quite rare in Buddhist temples. Inside, there are beautiful murals and statues depicting the life of the Buddha. The entire area is clean, well-maintained, and offers a calm, respectful environment. Located right by the Kalu Ganga (river), the setting is very picturesque especially at sunset. It’s a great place to reflect, take in some history, or simply enjoy the peaceful surroundings. We also appreciated that it wasn’t overcrowded when we went in the late afternoon.","October 15, 2025"

This temple is not only a religious site but also a cultural and historical monument. With Hai Srilanka Tours, I had the opportunity to observe beautiful Buddhist statues, paintings, and traditional buildings, while learning a great deal about the religious and historical significance of the place. Our guide, Sithum, explained everything to us in detail. No admission fee – free for all, though donations are welcome. Around 1–2 hours is the best to see and absorb the atmosphere.The temple atmosphere is serene and spiritual. You feel peace and positivity as soon as you enter.It is crowded during weekends, poya days (full moon), and religious festivals, but weekdays are quite emptier and peaceful.The staff and monks were friendly and courteous, politely guiding visitors on customs and prayers.This is the best place for anyone looking to experience Sri Lankan culture, Buddhism, and history. It is most appropriate for families, singles, and groups looking for an enrichment experience.","September 21, 2025"

The Stupa and the Bhodi Tree are an absolute must visit for any tourist. They are both located about 40 minutes out of Colombo, heading south at the mouth of the Kalu Ganga (river). The location itself is wonderfully picturesque. However the real treat is when you visit the actual Stupa as it is a white 3 storey high stupa that is uniquely hollow, allowing visitors to enter it, or even walk around the inside of it, or sit on the floor and just experience the peaceful atmosphere within. The larger stupa actually contains a smaller Stupa inside. The interior of the Stupa is decorated with paintings of the life of the Buddha. Then across the road from the Stupa is the Kalutara Bodhiya which is said to be another sapling grown from the original Bodhi Tree that is still living in Anuradhapura. Both these sites are very popular with all Sri Lankans. Therefore, you will find that both sites will be packed with devotees either just stopping-off before embarking on a long journey, or visiting for the day, or visiting and meditating perhaps for the day or even longer. When we visited, both sites were as usual very busy. The whole site had a very pleasant and peaceful energy. We observed many ladies at the Stupa praying or meditating around the site. We also entered the Stupa and walked around the inside, viewing all the paintings on the walls. While we were there, we observed a young man meditating and chanting Buddhist scriptures, in a very melodic tone, which seemed to reverberate around the whole Stupa. What a wonderful experience it was.","January 10, 2017"

You enter on one side of the road. There is no entrance fee but you have to leave your footwear and it is expected that you give a small tip to the staff keeping your shoes safe. It is a good idea to wear an old pair of socks to protect your feet as you visit the site. There are a few small buildings, including one brightly coloured Buddha on this side of the road. Then you travel via a tunnel under the busy main road to the site of the main temple. You pass many flower sellers and have to climb a considerable number of steps before you can enter the main dome. Uniquely, this is not solid but hollow. When you reach the top level inside, you can survey 360 degrees of town, countryside and river through the windows which go round the inside of the dome. Above the windows are a large number of paintings of the Buddha, his life and travels. The atmosphere is enhanced by the throng of pilgrims and people praying. So many sights catch the eye. I was amazed how some quite aged and badly crippled worshippers bravely climbed the large number of steps to reach the prayer hall and the main dome.

So much has changed since -  from the increased traffic to the noise and the pollution - turning the small, peaceful town of Kalutara once was, where I grew up, into a chaotic, restless place. There is a highway runs across the town, making it easier for the drivers to get from place to place , quicker than it used to be. Amid the hustle and the bustle, Buddhists never failed to stop by the Kalutara Bodhi.  The old temple I love to this day. This is the only place I miss since I moved out of Kalutara and  I never fail to visit the temple since. They have made a few changes, yet, the old Bo tree, (a sacred tree) and the old shrine room where there is a very old statue of Buddha, remained just as beautiful as they were many moons ago. This is due to the constant care given by the Buddhist society, in Kalutara.  You feel the power of the Blessings as soon as you step into the temple.  There is also another very big statue of Buddha on the other end of the temple.  Unlike those days, you do not have to risk your life trying to cross the main road to get to the other side of the road, where there is a branch of this ancient temple, that is built on a hire hill. There is a subway to cross the main street. These temples are situated by the famous Kalu river (meaning -black river in Sinhalese), where I used to bath with my Papa, when I was a little girl.  I absolutely adore this place.  I would also like to add, if you are lucky, you might see elephants on the roads, with their carers of course. Hearing the recent news of a man being attacked by an elephant in another country, this is something I always say to people who visit Sri Lanka. Wherever you go, if you see an elephant, do not  run up to it and start taking photographs, flashing the camera light in his eyes.  This disturbs the elephant.  Many years ago, someone dropped a cigarette end in front of the path of the elephants during the main procession in Kandy.  When the elephant stepped on it, he got disturbed.  That day, the elephants ran a riot and killed many people.  Elephants are adorable to look at, they are very important part in our lives, but when you visit these places, respect these animals and the religious places you visit.  You have to remove your shoes and dress appropriately.  Well, I hope many people would visit Kalutara and enjoy the sheer beauty of the nature.  Calico is another place to visit in Kalutara.  Be very careful when you visit this places.  If you go to the near by hotel for a cup of tea, you could see the Kalutara Bodhi from the distance and also, you can stand on the rocks, by the Calico.  I stress, be very careful, because water crazily swirls round the rocks. The photo of the Bodhiya is the temple on the hill, on the other side of the road.  Inside is hollow and massive.  It is decorated with stories of Buddha's life.  There are also statues of Buddha inside.  Takes about half an hour, if you care to read all the information and look at the beautiful paintings on the walls.  I have been there many times in my life time and I will be going again in February 2016.   This is why I selected this date from the drop down list.","February 2, 2016"

I have been to some other Buddhist temples in sri Lanka/ Mayanmar/ Indonesia but this is the only dome that i have come across which is empty from inside and you can go in. there is one more dome inside this big one. There also a lot of pictures depicting the life of Buddha and also of his different incarnations. Nice place to visit as it looks really beautiful during the night time. A very calming place with the chanting by the monks in the evening, when I had visited it. A must see in Kalutara. It is on  both sides of the road with and underpass connecting both the sides so that you need not cross the busy road.","February 28, 2015"

Facing the magnificent Kaluganga ( river). If you can visit around 7am or after 5pm you will witness some breath taking views from the kalutara bodhiya. Do not forget to walk into the kalutara bodhiya. The uniqueness of this temple is you can walk into the pagoda. Its a wonderful experiance believe me. As it is religious place always remeber to where a decent attire.,"February 19, 2015"

Spread across both side of the road, this is a spiritual Buddhist temple. Main prayer hall is a majestic circular hall and a definite visit in Kalutara. However, travellers beware that this is the only place in my entire Sri Lanka trip where people tried to scam and never expected the same inside Buddhist temple. On entry, one person offered to explain the place as a tour guide. In the end of the visit, he introduced to one person and saying that tomorrow is full moon and there will be prayer and offering at the temple, asked for USD  5 to give. I offered him LKR 100 sensing something amiss and this was a scam as the 2nd person was a complete outsider in connivance with the tour guide. At the end of the tour, the guide himself was asking for money and again the kiosk which was keeping shoes asking for money. I am ok offering money to the persons keeping shoes and also the guide explaining but the guide himself will scam in a Buddhist temple in the name of offering to God in full moon day is really bad!! Please note donation is accepted in all temples but always put the same in donation box and not to anyone directly.","December 16, 2014"
