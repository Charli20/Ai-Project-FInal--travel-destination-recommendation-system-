There were 5 reservoirs to ease the pressure on the main dam.

It was a complex ancient technology that worked until reconstructed in the 19th century when a structural design error altered the water flows. As a result there are now two lakes the largest consisting of Thopa Vewa, Eramudu Vewa and Dumbuthula Vewa and the smaller Kalahagala Vewa and Bhu Vewa.
