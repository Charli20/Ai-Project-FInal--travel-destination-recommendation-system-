Given the floods I kept and eye on updates and their website. Also checked with plantation stay we had planned. The train couldn’t reach Kandy but the stop prior . That was ok for us as the hotel said they would pick us up from there. The hotel and I kept checking with the railway and the website right up to 6 hours pre departure. On arrival at the station we were informed that the trains were cancelled due to line work ! We could have got the 4am train and we could get the one at 2pm . Was told at first that the website I looked at was fake! Pointed out that it was the same site I booked and received my tickets from! Then told that they don’t update the website! Welcome to the 21st century. The still manager seemed to find it all very funny. sitting there grinning at me. What’s more the hotel informed me that tickets were still available to buy for that trip!  The railway set up is a shambles , we had looked forward to this rail trip and one of the main reasons for visiting Sri Lanka. I understand floods can’t be helped but giving false and misleading information can. We ended up having to do the the 3hr trip by taxi. The farce didn’t end there . Another trip to Galle was booked (1st class not available ) . We booked 2nd class which should have guaranteed a seat , yeah right ! Might just as well spat in the wind. Still they carried on selling 2nd class tickets . Don’t bother with the toilets either , a hole in the floor to the tracks! We travelled rail in so many countries , this is without doubt the worst. Also beware of scammers on these  journeys waiting to pounce on unsuspecting travellers to lead them on to other scammers at the destination .. they work as teams .","January 11, 2026"

It is chaotic.  If you already have your tickets (purchased online) you can enter at the back entrance which our accommodation dropped us to, it is not as busy but there are stairs to cross over the train lines, so if you are carrying heavy baggage with you this can be hard going.  It was quite hard finding where the train would depart from and where we needed to stand.  A station worker came along before the train arrived asking to see tickets and directed us to the other end of the platform for boarding.  Getting on the train is quite busy and you need to be able to lift your own bags up train steps although some people did help out.  The seats assigned were not that hard to find.  We did the trip to Galle along the coast and it was really pleasant.  The doors on our carriage were locked and they didn't allow people to walk through.  There were a couple of people coming through selling drinks and food but we had already got snacks and drinks with us so didn't need anything.  The right hand side of the train had the best views of the coast but you can still see on the other side.  Glad we had booked first class tickets so we had a seat as the train was packed by the time it arrived at fort station.  Can't purchase 2nd class tickets for this stretch ahead of time.","April 9, 2025"

She was alone, anxious in the early morning when it was still dark. A man approached us and told us that he wanted to buy a ticket to the finish line. When I felt like I should stay away from him, he opened the zipper on my body bag. My wallet, which was jabbered, I couldn't slurp, but it was a hiccup because I also had my passport in it. We were giving out free milk tea on the station platform, but when I asked if it was free, they said how much. When I didn't get it, a woman nearby told me to drink it because it was free and it was delicious. Urban stations require caution. A photo was also taken of Japanese people, perhaps because they are rare. It's been a lot, but it's been a good experience.","January 12, 2025"

Terence took us to everywhere and gave us local recommendations, and was a great way to know the country from a local view.

Fares are cheap, and some trains have openable windows that are preferable to air conditioned carriages. There are some shops, and provided one takes the usual precautions with smartphones and wallets/purses/bags, the station area is safe.

All I did was to get of my train, then I looked around, and then I pushed myself with a mass of other people that were pushing themselves to the exit.

You will need to give it at the exit to the train station's personnel that is collecting the train tickets from people leaving the train station. Outside part of the train station is another nightmare. Full of tuk tuk and taxi drivers, you won't have a minute of peace to check e.g. map, orientate yourself or plan you next steps. When you cross the street, there is bunch of stands selling bunch of useless things that you don't need and you are just pushing yourself also through that.

It was a terrible 4-hour journey.  We were not prepared for the trains to be that crowded.  We didn't have place to even stand properly, let alone keep our baggage.  It was very claustrophobic.  I would have rather spent the 8K on an AC cab than take the train, had I known it was going to be so bad. We arrived at Colombo station, and from there we were told we could take a tuk tuk to the airport.   Being a fairly large station, I expected some sort of organization, but there was no pre-paid taxi or tuk-tuk stand, and the guy at the inquiry counter was busy on the phone and just ignored me.  The tuk-tuk drivers at the stand follow you around n quote ridiculous prices.  They quoted between 3K and 4K to the airport which is about 34 kms away.  We obviously thought that was too much and started walking a little further in an attempt to wave down a passing tuk-tuk, but the drivers follow you around and harass you.  The minute you flag down a tuk-tuk, they start speaking in the local language and telling the driver how much to ask for.  At one point, one of these drivers following us went and sat in one of the tuk-tuks we had stopped n started arguing with that driver because he was stealing his customers. Luckily, in the end, after walking about 100 mts, we managed to get a really nice guy who charged us by the meter.  We even gladly paid him extra, and he was very happy.","February 28, 2020"

It's full of people pushing each other with no one to tell you what queue to join. People can be often seen cutting queues here and there is no official to keep track of it. When you go inside the station you will see it's too crowded. There is a small snack shop which charges more than the MRP. At least at the railway station I would have expected some kind of regulation (which is missing in the rest of Sri Lanka anyway). A 1.5 L water bottle was being sold for 80 LKR when the MRP mentioned was 70 LKR. I raised this with the man at the counter to which he gave some crazy explanation. Since you cannot go out of the station once you have entered (they take your ticket back on your way out), you don't have a choice but to buy water or other essentials from here if you forgot to buy them outside. There is a bridge to access different platforms on the station. However, the locals rarely follow the bridge. Most people go from above the train tracks even though it has been clearly mentioned not to do so. There is a very small waiting room which is almost always crowded. It's better to sit on the benches than in the waiting room. Try to book tickets in advance and come to the station only 15 minutes prior to the departure of your train.","November 22, 2019"

The architectural design of the station reminded me of the old Tanjong Pagar Railway Station in Singapore. This southern last station of the Malayan Railway line was also built by the British Straits Settlement government and facilitated travel to Peninsular Malaysia. It is now replaced by a faster modern Mass Rapid Transit System that better serves the transportation needs of Singaporeans. I took the train to Kandy from this station. I came on the same day and bought the second class ticket at counter 4 for 240 rupees. I see no reason to pay a higher cost to reserve the tickets which can be done at Counter 17. There are at least 2 to 3 morning trains to Kandy on the same day. When I came about half an hour before the first train arrived, there was no queue at the ticket counters. The Kandy tickets for 3rd class and 1st and 2nd class are purchased over Counter 3 and 4. All the counter staff at this station were very helpful. I asked one of them the direction to Slave Island and he showed me the direction. I asked about the process in purchasing the Kandy ticket and the explanation was detailed and clear. The ticket staff also informed the platform where I should wait for my train. I felt their service is spectacular and commendable. However, just a word of caution when buying ticket over the counter. It did not happen in this train station. It happened at Kandy Station. One of my friends bought his 2nd class ticket over the counter. It cost 300 rupees. He gave the counter staff a 1000 rupee note. He did not count the change on the spot and later found that he was short changed 500 rupees. I personally was also a victim for such similar scam when I bought a yogurt product at a provision shop in Ella and at a supermarket at the airport. I was alert and confronted the staff and he apologetically blamed himself for the counting error. I knew the intention was deliberate and tourists who are in a hurry became victims. It is also advisable to use smaller notes for such transactions over the counter. There is a canteen in the train station but I had breakfast before I came. There are also foreigners' toilets which I supposed to be cleaner than the local ones. The wooden benches at the platform had stains left by the birds and are not very clean. There are also signboards warning tourists not to leave their luggage unattended which I think is helpful to tourists. While the train station is old, the number of passengers plying the train to and from Colombo remains extremely high and it is the jumping board station for most tourists traveling to the inner regions of Sri Lanka. It is a cheap mode of transport for both the locals and foreigners. It is an eye-opening experience taking the train in Sri Lanka and in one way or another you will visit this old colonial station.","April 8, 2019"

I would recommend getting the tickets the day before ( especially for Jaffna as it leaves the station at 5.45am). This takes the stress out of journey. Be focussed on not letting people direct you in different places, it really is clear. When you go in the ticket room the Jaffna desk is right over to the right. I think Kandy etc are more to the left and they had big queues. Oddly hardly any western tourists when we went. Next day we were off early and felt absolutely safe.  We were confused where to go when we arrived as there were a large number of people commuting that frankly just get in the way of trying to get in the station...another reason why you really should get your tickets the day before.

We got to the train station with about 40 mins to spare for our train at 10.30 from Colombo to Galle. It was easy to get a ticket and cost us each 180 for second class tickets. The guy at the platform told us which platform to go to as our train hadn’t even appeared on the board. Once on the train it was very busy and we ended up standing for the first hour but luckily people got off at different stations and we got a seat eventually. The train ride is about 2 and a bit hours, it’s not that comfortable and the toilet is basically a hole that goes straight on the tracks which we found to be an experience in its self 😂. Once at Galle, it is good to look when the trains are back the next day. It’s not a trip you can do in a day as the last train back seems to be around 3/4pm. Many people try to help you saying they work at the station but usually they do help but then have another agenda e.g. then try get you to take a taxi with them. On our way back to Colombo we ended up getting the bus back as we would have had to wait 2 hours for the train and we both we’re not looking forward to the journey again. Some men tried to get us to get in a taxi for 5000 which seemed cheap but in comparison to the train ticket it is not. In the end we just went to the bus station to ask and found a bus straight away the price was 340 each to get to Colombo which we took as we were confirmed seats, air con and was definitely a more comfort drive. We asked if we could get dropped off earlier then Colombo as we would have driven past our accommodation and it was fine to do that. It may take an hour longer to get to each destination but definitely more comfortable and I would recommend looking at getting the bus both ways.","July 3, 2018"

We were quoted the correct price, given a receipt number and informed that we could pick the tickets up on arrival at the railway station. We travelled by taxi from our accommodation in Negombo, heavily laden with backpacks and additional day packs, and arrived leaving an hour before the scheduled 8.30 departure time on Good Friday March 30, 2018. After locating the appropriate ticket counter (Counter 17), we were told that there were no tickets booked for us, the receipt number was incorrect and there were no available seats on that train or any train to Kandy on that or subsequent days. As there was a line of other customers behind us, we left the counter and went to the Railway Tourist Information Office next door. The office was not yet open but a helpful person told us that we could put our bags down inside and wait for someone to help us. We accepted the offer, respite from a crowded footpath and a seat in an air conditioned office. After making his morning offerings, a man named Sampath told us that he would inquire about the availability of tickets for us. He came back some time later with the information that there were no vacancies on the 8.30 train as it was a very busy holiday, but he would see if he could get us tickets on a later train. He made one or more phone calls and told us that it would be possible to get tickets for reserved seats on the 10.30 train. After much coming and going we he returned and revealed that the seats were available only as part of a package holiday involving accommodation and drivers/guides. As we had already booked accommodation in Kandy, he ""helpfully"" put together an itinerary based on our travel plans. We were a little surprised at the quoted costs but, as new arrivals in the country and feeling trapped in Colombo on one of the busiest travel days of the year, were in a good position to be exploited. We agreed to a much shortened and cheaper version of the 15 day package that was offered. The full package cost the equivalent of (Australian) $1 700 for 15 days. This exceeded our budget and did not match our desire to plan our travel as we discovered more about the country and what we wanted to do in it. The final deal was for 2 one way tickets to Kandy, 4 nights of accommodation in Sigiriya, and a driver/guide to drive us from Kandy to Sigiriya, to our destinations for the next 4 days and back to Kandy on the last day. While we waited for the process to play out and our tickets to be obtained we observed the same scam being used on a succession of European and Asian travellers by the other officials in the Information Office. The accommodation in Sigiriya was good but the driver, while seemingly friendly, offered very limited advice or details and at every opportunity tried to persuade us to go to costly tourist attractions and buy safari and village tours, which we declined. We have since discovered that the accommodation was owned by the ""tourist information officer"" and he has been using this as his main source of bookings for a long time. This scam is well known to many within the tourism sector in Sri Lanka and is not limited to Colombo Fort Station. The cost of both the accommodation and driver were inflated, so that the 76 000 rupee ($A 654) we paid was well in excess of what we would have paid by independently booking. Stick to information from the official government tourist offices which are located at the airport and in a number of cities throughout Sri Lanka. They do not receive commissions or kick backs, offer good advice to travellers, are very well informed and put together itineraries that match your interests and allow you to see everything possible in the budget and timelines available to you. They also book you excellent  drivers that (while not seemingly cheap) have great knowledge that they enthusiastically impart. We found the accommodation bookings they arranged for us to always exceed our expectations.","May 16, 2018"

It's highly recommended to purchase them a month prior to your travel day, as the 1st and 2nd class seat tickets usually sell out quickly.  With the help of our Colombo hotel staff, our tickets were purchased for the exact train #, date and time I wanted.  It's important to research all that in advance so you have seats on the train you want, because there are not only many date/time options but also many different types of train options and also many seating options.  If you don't research this in advance and (ideally) purchase your tickets in advance, you may have a lot of stress trying to do this at the station - many locals have limited English-speaking abilities and they may not understand what you want.  So you may be on a train to somewhere other than where you want to go! Once at the station, with tickets in hand, we didn't know where to board the train for closest access to our seats.

We were pretty lucky with timing, in that the drivers' strike resolved itself just the afternoon before we were due to depart. We arrived early in the morning to pick up our pre-booked tickets. Some observations of our experience: 1) There are hordes of tuk tuk drivers just outside the station. These guys are pushy, not to mention sometimes downright stupid (if I just arrived at a train station in a taxi, do you really think I now want a tuk tuk?). Others will tell you to be polite and say ""no thank you"". I say, bugger that: If you show any acknowledgement, these guys will continue harassing you. Avoid eye contact, don't look at them, and pretend they don't exist. 2) There is no signage in English within the station to tell you which platform to go to for which train. This is ridiculous considering how many tourists use the station. 3) When we went in, the station officers checked our tickets. A well-dressed short man immediately came over and started gesturing to us to show him our ticket; he then used gestures to show us where to stand, which direction the train would be coming from, etc. He seemed very nice, and this was a big relief given the complete lack of information we'd received. When we got on the train he put our bags on (doing the same for the other tourists). He then wandered through the carriage showing everyone photocopied information about a school for the deaf and a donations sheet (all with R1000 donations). He gestured to us to complete the sheet and make a donation. And yes... I fell for it. I'm a skeptical, cynical person with no problem telling people to **** off, but amidst the noise and confusion and general crapness of the station, I fell for the social pressure got scammed for R1000. Don't let this be you - if you come across the same guy, just say no! (Or give him R50 for the help if you really want to - I'm 99% sure he's not really deaf!!) If you don't know where to stand, ask someone in uniform (in our case the train to Kandy was on the platform nearest the entrance, with the train door to the first and second class reserved carriages being on the far right as you enter the station). So that all sucked. The station staff clearly don't care about tourists - the ""deaf"" scammer had come to us when we were still talking to the station staff, and they seemed to have no problem with him leading us away (despite this clearly being a regular scam). They are presumably in on his take. Wtf is the point of a nice polite tourist information service if you're going to let scammers into the station to harass tourists?","January 8, 2018"

Transportation is plentiful outside the station, by either Taxi or TukTuk. Train travel is a very convenient and cheap way to travel through Sri Lanka.  You could travel to several destinations in luxury and at a low rate using the Expo Rail. You can find a train to Kandy, Negombo, Galle, Anuradhapura, Trincomale, Baticoloa and Jaffna from here. Luxury trains with AC also are available here to serve you. Take care about your valuables from the  thieves outside the station. I have used Colombo Fort Rail station very often and it has been fine. I live in Kandy and work in Colombo and I travel home and back by trains and I have to come here as the trains start the journeys from here. Finding the correct platform and train seat was very simple.Travelling by train is comfortable and enjoyable and fast as they are not held up due to traffic. In most occasions, Ihave used this station. They will announce about the journey of the train in Sihala, Tamil and in English languages.  I have gone on train to visit many places like Kandy, Badulla, Anuradhapura, Matara and Jaffna using the Sri Lankan railway service. it is low cost and a very efficient way to view the beauty of Sri Lanka. The station has many ticket counters and all are numbered, Above all, there is a list of places they stop and the cost involved for the journey to different destinations.  There are different Numbered ticket counters for different routes and they are nicely notified by signboards. If in doubt go to counters 6 or 7 which are the inquiry counters where you can get help or even ask the schedules. We traveled on the Sri Lankan trains to Hikkaduwa, Galle, Kandy and Negombo and had no problems at all finding the train times and getting the correct trains. 500 or 1000 LKR notes are best for the ticket counters as the train prices are very cheap in Sri Lanka.There is a digital board displaying the time schedules of the trains destination at a particular time. If you travel to ""Nuwara Eliya"" you get  absolutely beautiful scenery. Cost was 2200 Rupee's in the 1st.class with meals and drinks. Took approximately  6 hours and I loved every minute of it.You'll certainly enjoy the experience. Train travel whilst in Sri Lanka is a must. Much more pleasant than catching the buses but having continuity in ticket prices and bookings does not exist. First class gives you air conditioning and generally a seat (not too crowded) but best to only have carry-on luggage. Third class is with many people as possible. Once you have your ticket go through the entrance and there is a large screen which will tell you the platform number, it changes between Sri Lanka and English every 30 seconds or so. When on the correct platform you can ask a member of staff which end of the platform the carriages for 2nd or 3rd class will arrive. Once the train starts to appear pick you bags up and get ready for the rush to the door. People rush to get into the train which is  no different to ‘rush’ hour at any station in the world. Keep your ticket as you will need to hand it in when you get off the train. The trains are heavily used in Sri Lanka so if you are slow getting on you may not have a seat. If so, and you don’t mind standing, you can stand by the open carriage doors which is a great way to see the country side pass by. You can either use the  website or instead just go to the station to book the tickets. But better to inquire beforehand the time schedule of the train to your destination if it is a long distance one. Try to get an ‘express’ train rather than a ‘slow’ train as they are slow. If you have the time and like the countryside, you must take a trip on the railways from Colombo Fort, It is worth a peek inside, if you are not traveling, there are public restrooms as well. I recommend you to start your journey from Fort station in the train to your destinations.","October 15, 2017"

There was also a 'helpful' man that showed us how to get to the right platform with trying to lug our cases up over the stairs). In fairness we would not have found the over the tracks path without him but he then proceeded to hit us with the ""i'm deaf' signs and asked for a 'donation'. Didn't cost much (we gave a couple of hundred rupee, when he was asking for a couple of thousand), but takes the edge of the helpfulness of it. The train was OK - we were in the first class observation carriage (although not the air-conditioned one a it wasn't running that day, so it was a warm 2.5 hours to Galle, with no food on the train and drop toilets). But we'd brought provisions so were OK. The trip was worth it, you travel by the ocean for most of the trip to Galle and go through many villages, so it was really interesting and only 800 rupee each. The Galle station is also massively busy, OK in the station but you will be absolutely harassed by tuk tuk drivers the minute you step foot outside. If you are staying in the Galle Fort area, it's easier to just walk out and go around the Galle Cricket Stadium and you'll find the couple of gates into the fort - it's under 850m to get into the fort area from the station. We tried to book tickets back from Galle to Colombo (for first class tickets you can only book in person and a day or so prior to the trip  - you can't book 2nd and 3rd class) but their system was down and advised that we try tomorrow (shrug) - they day we wanted to leave - or take a train to Matara to book there (an hour away). Ended up booking a taxi (which was horrific) but it's with taking a train trip.","June 4, 2017"

I got more information from a dapper man who saw me looking lost and came up to volunteer information about the trains (although I really suspect he was looking for a tip or for me to decide to take his taxi instead) I wanted to take a trip to Mount Lavinia on the Galle line for the experience and, although I managed on the day that I travelled to buy a 2nd class ticket on the 8.35 train, no matter what counter I went to could anyone tell me the times of returning trains. It was only when I arrived in Mount Lavinia that I could establish there was a return train in 5 minutes or I needed to wait four hours. The actual train ride consisted of standing absolutely squashed and unseeing in the vestibule (but fun talking to fellow passengers, some of whom had suitcases and didn't comprehend they would be standing for 2 hours to Galle) . I might as well have bought a third class ticket - not that either was very expensive which explains why there is no spare money to do up the station.

The Dutch Fort – Galle - The South Coast’s major city is Galle, whose oldest landmark is the massive Portuguese and Dutch Fort which is a “World Heritage Site” in which the central city is contained. But the city may be much older. Some scholars believe it to be the “Tarshish” of the Old Testament, to which King Solomon sent his merchant vessels, and to which Jonah fled from the Lord. Today, the 90-acre Galle Fort shows no evidence of the Portuguese founders. The Dutch incorporated the Portuguese northern wall in a great rampart in 1663. A second, taller wall was built inside of it. Between the two walls, a covered passage connected the central bastion with the Fort’s two half bastion’s overlooking the sea.

Reminds me of traveling on the northern line during rush hour as the train can get packed like sardines. Especially on the way back as we left around 18:15pm to get back. We went left out the station and headed to the Hilton for some lunch and much needed luxury for my fellow travellers then back to the station as there is an indoor market /bazaar which is good for bartering. Across the road and to the right of the station is the busier markets and definitely worth a visit.,"January 12, 2017"

This is a must do experience in SL ad I was afraid I would not be able to show my husband and daughter why.  With some trepidation I accepted the last available tickets for Ella to Nanu Oya in 3rd class.  I have been to SL many times as it s my ancestoral home, although it was 22 years since my last visit; I knew 3rd class was probably going to be cramped, uncomfortable and the locals travelling could be accompanied by any manner of goods or animals and be packed into the carriage!  Despite being shown to the embarkation point off the end of the platform in the dust; I was very wrong. It allowed us to get an amazing picture of the train as it arrived. The allocated seats were covered in a lovely blue PVC and padded! There were no standing passengers and everyone was very civilised. The windows were large enough to lean out of but better still we were able to sit with our feet hanging out of the door for long periods (we felt we had to let other people have a go) and get the best views of the passing countryside up into the tea country..... just the best part of the holiday by far. A couple of traders came down the carriage with filled buns and fresh roasted spiced nuts for just a few pence. Simple pleasures are always the best. At some of the stations local farmers bring their vegetables to the train and trade is done on the run literally as the train is moving, just as it has done for decades. Just do it and don't be put off by people who tell you tales.  We thought the 2 1/2 hour journey would be tiresome.... next time we are doing the whole day trip, it was fantastic.","January 12, 2017"

Basically, only 1st class will get you reserved seats, but you must do this in advance and through an agency - check on-line. It will cost you considerably more, but its still cheap. Otherwise, you buy a 2nd class ticket, and tickets to destinations 1-2 hours' distant are cheaper than a tube ride in London. Don't expect to get a seat, but relax - once you get on (it may seem daunting, but just move forward), settle in a place (by the doors are preferable for air and views, but between the seats is okay, too). Expect vendors and some beggars to walk around and over you - the cut pineapple and pomengranite seemed safe enough and delicious. Note: Upon returning to Colombo, passengers getting on the train will not wait for you to disembark first. Look to see where Sri Lankans are exiting and follow them. Although it can be stressful, it was a pleasure feeling the air through the open doorways. There's usually a local hanging out the door behind you, so not too much worry about falling out. It's also a great opportunity to meet other travellers.","January 12, 2017"

At this time we decided on one thing and that was to go to Kandy by train. On arriving at the station we was pointed to the Tourist Information Centre for help obtaining our ticket. We met Prasanna who was a very good help because the train we wanted to catch was full but got us sorted on the next train in comfortable seats with air con. At this point he started talking about booking a tour through him ""we thought here we go"" After a lengthy chat and giving us some figures ""which sounded a very good deal"" we decided to book and I'm glad we did. We would have never been able to see as much of Sri Lanka so easily without this tour. It was arranged for our driver to pick us up from our hotel in Kandy and that he did. This is when we met Lahiru Dissanayaka our driver and tour companion for 5 days. Lahiru was an absolute godsend and became a very good friend over them 5 days. We saw everything possible in the time we had and Lahiru's knowledge of the places we visited was exceptional. We saw everything we could from our Kandy City tour on our first day. Kandy to Nuwara Eliya on our second day. Nuwara Eliya to Matale, Dambulla and Sigiriya on our third. A jeep Safari at Polonnaruwa ""we saw so many elephants, it was a beautiful sight"" and all the ancient ruins on our fourth. On our fifth day Lahiru took us from Sigiriya to the drop off point of our choice which was a long trek to Trincomalee seeing and stopping at some beautiful sights on our way. It was sad to see Lahiru go and I would highly recommend Rail Tours to see all the beautiful sights of Sri Lanka at a very good price. Just take your time when your in the office and point out what you want to see and when and you won't be disappointed.

However this post is in relation for tourists using the 'tourist information' which is not just for information but booking travel.

But our trip included and a/c van and driver for Colombo to hikkaduwa then to aruganbay, ella and then to kandy. We also had an OBSERVATION carriage booked for the beautiful train ride from Ella to Nanuoya as well. All dealt through Prasanna Ferdinando (tour assistant) we were happy for the majority of the package. However, he tried to screw us for a little extra. Firstly, lying about the exchange rate (he called the bank to to prove he was right and shown to be completely and utterly wrong). This was to gain that little extra from us which he gave up on as he said we had given the him a 'headache' (all very embarrassing and rude). Secondly, instead of buying the tickets for the observation carriage for the later part of the trip in Ella (1000 rupees each ticket), he got us the 3rd class tickets (400 rupees each or less). Finding this out a couple of days before, a stern call to Prasanna meant out driver bought the tickets and gave them to us when he returned to pick out bags us at Ella while we got the train. That said our driver was a legend and a good laugh. This made up for poor experience with Prasanna.","July 16, 2016"

We had to make several stops, and one departure through this train station, and each time we commuted it was a learning experience.  The first thing we learned was don't trust anybody when it came to where your train was leaving, sometimes not even your ticket.  The only people that seemed to know which platform our train was leaving was a group of def people that would help you find your train, and help with your bags, then demand a large tip. Cleanliness was also a second thought in this station, it was so bad that I didn't dare use the bathrooms from the smell alone. There also isn't much as far as places to get snacks or a meal if you're transferring.  Best to go outside and enjoy some of the street kiosks if you can instead. Security was also pretty non-existent, unless you're a traveler. It seems that if you have a bag, a ticket, and look confused security will stop and make sure you're not breaking into the station.  However if you're a random person selling something, a scam artist, illegal cab driver, or any other person you're welcome to come in no questions asked. The reason this station doesn't get a completely poor review is that it's a pretty nice building.  Under the layers of dust it's pretty interesting.  I took a few pictures there that really are spectacular.  Notionally you'll need a train ticket to take these pictures, but if you don't have a ticket, security might just let you through anyways.","July 7, 2016"

It's a shame and with a good restoration could be a very attractive and important landmark. Avoid the toilets at all cost. If you are arriving in Colombo and are a foreigner, you will be accosted by a the tuk-tuk drivers, all claiming they'll give you a good deal. Most of them do NOT have meters, and you should avoid them altogether; the prices they offer you are typically double what a metered tuk-tuk would charge. Some tuk-tuks have meters, but the drivers will tell you that they are out of order; they say they will give you ""meter price"" but don't believe it. Some will also wave a certificate in your face saying they are ""Official Fort Railway Station"" registered or some such nonsense. Be aware that this means absolutely nothing. Keep in mind that there is an unofficial mafia of sorts, that controls who gets to pick up customers at the station, and any driver not part of this monopoly is forced to park off the property. As with anywhere in Colombo, if you get a metered cab, make sure they turn them on when you start to make sure they actually do work. If you can't find a good tuk-tuk, or your red-flags are flying (always follow your instincts) the thing to do is, upon leaving the station, walk to your left; there are huge numbers of tuk-tuks parked on the street; these guys are generally more honest than the cabal which controls the station parking lot.","June 20, 2016"

The way to enjoy it is to just go with the flow.  The station itself is easy to find and all tuk-tuk drivers know where it is. The station has many ticket counters, all numbered, and above which is a list of places they stop and the cost.  If in doubt go to counters 6 or 7 which are the inquiry counters where you can get help.  We travelled on the Sri Lankan trains to Hikkaduwa, Galle, Kandy and Negombo and had no problems at all finding the train times and getting the correct trains.  500 or 1000 LKR notes are best for the ticket counters as the train prices are very cheap in Sri Lanka.  Once you have your ticket go through the entrance and there is a large screen which will tell you the platform number, it changes between Sri Lanka and English every 30 seconds or so. When on the correct platform you can ask a member of staff which end of the platform the carriages for 2nd or 3rd class will arrive.  Once the train starts to appears pick you bags up and get ready for the rush to the door.  There will not be any manners shown, so it will be every man, woman and child for yourself. (No different to ‘rush’ hour at any station in the world).  Keep your ticket as you will need to hand it in when you get off the train. The trains are heavily used in Sri Lanka so if you are slow getting on you may not have a seat.  If so, and you don’t mind standing, you can stand by the open carriage doors which is a great way to see the country side pass by. We didn’t use the website instead just went to the station to book the tickets. PS. Try to get an ‘express’ train rather than a ‘slow’ train as they are slow.","April 3, 2016"

It was built in 1908 and did not appear to have had any upgrading work done. I was told it had 10 platforms and steps and a bridge connecting to these. One modern aspect is the display screen but one could not trust whether the information was accurate. It was very noisy, sometimes painful to the ear as each train entered and left the platform. One could hardly hear the other speaking. Maybe I am old and sensitive to this noise. There were security/ticket checkers sitting at entry and exit points. However it was easy to push through the crowds and enter the station without any checking. Inside the station, there were some seats but not enough for the number of passengers waiting. Our train was to Jaffna leaving at 5.45 am. I wanted to check something about my ticket. There were no information or ticket counters inside. However there was a room where several men were seated behind their desks. There were no computers, everything done manually. If you expect western standards you may think the men were not interested and unhelpful. However, this is the way it seems things are in Srilanks, there are no queues and people tend to push with the 'me first' attitude. I did get my answers to my questions but also advice that one of the trains I had booked my return journey was a slow train taking 10 hours. I was grateful for this information and was able to change my ticket. Unlike airports there are porters to help with your luggage I did not see any porters here.

We visited in the evening during the hours of darkness after quite a long walk around the actual Fort and the massive hotel/base for navy personnel. Here was I naive enough to think that I could just buy a ticket, get on a train and arrive at my destination. First you have to find the right ticket office. There are many each selling tickets to various places. Don't even think of credit cards which are by the way generally not liked. This is due to high commissions when every Rp. is needed. Anyway we eventually were directed to the right booth and got a single ticket to Mt Lavinia for the princely sum of Rp 10 (UKP 0.05). We entered the station and there our dystopian (opposite of utopian)  experience began. They have obviously decided to save money by using low wattage 500 mHz bulbs. These white LED type lights don't have any ooompph so the whole reminded me of what Victoria England under the gas lights might have been like. We were directed to Platform 5. Fair enough. A train came in which we found through asking was the Express to Galle. I could swear it stopped at our destination station but the verdict from people was that the next train was the one. The express train arrived at 6.40 and people immediately got on. So far so good. However the train showed no signs of moving. To cut a long story short it departed at 7.30 pm. A train is not full unless at least six people were hanging out of each door and this proved to be the case. When the train starts to pull out off the station people were still running down the stairs and jumping on. Maybe it pulls out slowly for this reason. So, 'our' train is due to depart 7.50 pm. No sign. If you hope for indicator signs there was one on our platform but not working. It's that little word 'maintenance' which is missing from the vocabulary. It was bought and paid for so end of story. There is one brightly illuminated  departure board in three languages (Tamil, English and Sinhala the local language) but the information is not updated and the refresh rate is so high that it is impossible to read. As for asking people - that's hit and miss. Most locals have not been outside their own country. Europe and European languages are totally unfamiliar to them so quite frankly we might as well come from another planet. This is confusing as the locals are so polite that they nod and smile to anything you say but they don't have the faintest idea of what you are talking about.  Even 'does this train go to Mt. Lavinia' is too much for 90% of people. Tip - look for someone well dressed. They are more likely to be educated in languages and be able to help. Oh, and don't expect to see the destination on the front of the train or on the sides. Look for the train number plate on the engine for clues as to where it is going. You might want to avoid the bathrooms. Anyway, the 7.50 pm train never turned up so at 8 pm we left and took a Tuk Tuk down to our base.  BTW Tuk Tuks wont break the bank. For example a 3 km ride will set you back less than Rp. 160  0.80UKP. More of Tuk Tuks later If you want to read about all my adventures you can get to them via my user name on the left of this page.  I am open for questions.   19 Feb 2015","February 20, 2015"
