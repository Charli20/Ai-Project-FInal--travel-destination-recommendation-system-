Standing at this remote location, where the land meets the ocean, provides a unique sense of connection to the island's geography. However, visitors should be aware that there is no dedicated parking area at Sankkotai. You’ll need to park at a distance and walk to reach the point, which adds to the experience as you take in the natural surroundings.
