In Tamil Arisi means rice Male means the beach.The sand got on your feet can be wiped off easily as they do not stick on the legs like other sand. It is a small beach.It is in Pulmudai which is 60 km away from Trincomalee along Nilaweli Uppuweli road. You have to travel in a semi forest area to get there.Do not take the road leading to the Arisimalee Temple as it is not at the beach. You can walk in the lagoon to get here also as the water is not deep. Paul.udai has black beaches generally rich in Ilmanite. This place is a lovely one for a swim and it is calm and quiet.The water is crystle clear and not deep. Little waves are experienced. The view is also superb. There is a Navy camp nearby and you have to park your vehicles before it and walk about 1/ 2 km to come to the beach.,"December 22, 2019"

View is superb all around. Good to visit early morning for sunrise. When you are coming from nilaveli side take the route shown by google maps if you are traveling in a low ground clearance vehicle. If not there’s a short cut as well which is also shown in the map yet not recommended. There you have a board mentioning the road to arisimale temple. We took this road and hardly managed to reach the beach with a lot of effort in maneuvering the vehicle. But all that effort was worthwhile after seeing the view from the beach. There’s a navy camp there and you need to park the vehicle outside and walk about 500m through the jungle. Good to visit if you are in Trincomalee.,"October 16, 2019"

It was just 10 minutes walk across the lagoon (water Knee high) from where i was. It's nice secluded path leading to the beach.
