Irrespective of which way you travel from ERS absolute scenic beauty is guaranteed. Travel the 20 km’s towards Badulla (the end of upcountry railway track) and you will ride over the Nine Arch Bride and Pass the Demodara Railway Loop. Ride in the opposite direction towards Idalgashinna Railway Station also 20 km’s away and you will enjoy spectacular views of tea plantations and sleepy mountainous villages. Generally 4 trains pass by ERS during the day and tickets are issued only a short while before each train arrives so make sure to be at the station ahead of time to secure your ticket. There is also a safe vehicle parking area besides the station in case you have to leave behind the vehicle you drive/ride. A lessor known fact is that Sri Lanka Railways (and of course the ERS) is one of the last remaining railway’s in the world to continue to use Edward Tyer's century and half old ingenious tablet signalling system, while other countries have gone on to adopt more advanced radio and electronic signalling methods. If you are interested to take a look at the ‘key token instrument’ get to the station before the rush and have a friendly chat with the station master….I hope he will oblige your request (well I have not asked my self though!)","January 26, 2020"

And one of the best part of this train ride is to witness the small, quaint and antique looking railways stations on the way. Let it be hatton, nuwara eliya or Ella. We loved all these small railways stations as much as we loved the train ride. They gave us a feeling of living 40-50 years back in time. The station is very basic but it's in the middle of the nature and you gotta take a picture in front of the train when it is stopped here.

Tickets are quite hard to come by and it is better to ask a travel agent to get them for you as reserved seats go on sale 30 days before the date and have to be picked up in person.

Alternatively risk standing for 7 hours, on a beautiful, but hot, jolty train, squished in with tourists and locals alike. We were lucky, we arrived an hour before and got a set of tickets. Mrs Johnson was tasked with seat grabbing. She is a habbbitual London commuter, so her area of expertise. Me with, our two rucksacks, was to follow on. Great made plans of mice and men will often go awry, and the train door to the 2nd class carriage stopped but feet away from me, leaving Mrs J blindsided. A scrabble emerged, my weight of 100kg plus two 25kg bags, front and rear, made a formidable force, sending many Europeans flying as I entered the train behind one other. And thank god I did, we got the last two seats and therefore secured our tenure for the 7 hours to Kandy. The view is beautiful. If you can, sit on the right hand side from Ella to Nuwara Elliya and the left side thereafter to Kandy, if you are fortunate enough to have a choice. You will get views in any case if you don't get that option, but for full exposure this is the best way to do it. A string of merchants peddling everything from fresh fruit to deep fried salty snacks push through, baskets on their heads, malevolently scolwing at the tourists they scatter on their mission, followed shortly by yet more chaps with cold drinks and coffee. Don't think for one moment that the exit at Kandy is any easier, as this isn't the last stop, Colombo is. Therefore, as you are pulling yourself from 7 hours in a jauntilly angled chair, you will be ambushed left right and centre as the train stops, by those wishing to secure your perch for the next leg. A mad scrabble ensued, made easier by my significant belly of 21 days rice, curry and Lion Larger and we landed, unceremoniously, on the platform, to a throng of delighted tuk tuk drivers waiting for us and therefore their next fare. One tip, overheard from a man with an impressive beard and even more impressive shirt: take a tuk tuk an hour or so from Ella, they are cheap so no concern there, to the origination point of the train, Badulla. Far from the madding throng of tourists, you will be guaranteed not only a seat, but a choice of seat and no fisty cuffs with fellows at Ella Station. You will also sail over the acclaimed nine arch Bridge, therefore adding another layer of excellence to this already exciting journey.","January 8, 2019"

We managed to board but seats had been “reserved” by one Russian lady who seemed to think that water bottles and baseball caps retained seats!
