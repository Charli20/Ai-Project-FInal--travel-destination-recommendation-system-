Sella katharagama is cheapest compare to other places. How ever, price of fruit basket is 03 time or more if you are going to buy from katharagama and Kiri Wehera area. i strongly suggest, if you are traveling on your own vehicle, please have the fruits taken before hand and this will help for you to save lot unnecessary expenditure which is not worth enough. also most of the traders around the area are too rude. in case if you want to buy vegetable, you may find that it's much cheaper than the Colombo or sub-herbs. but the vegges are sold in bags full, and only you will have good stuff on the top. the bottom is full of rotten vegetables. be careful in case if you wants to buy vegetables.","January 23, 2019"

The Kovil is open right through the day till 7.30 p.m. If you are not oriented traditionally I suggest that you visit this temple after visiting Kataragama since there the temple closes in the afternoon from 1.30 to 6.15 p.m.Here in Sella the main deity is Lord Ganesha.
