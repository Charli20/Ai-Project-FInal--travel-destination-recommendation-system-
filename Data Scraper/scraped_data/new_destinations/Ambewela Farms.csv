What should have been a pleasant, scenic stop turned into a disturbing and upsetting experience that cast a shadow over what is meant to be a once-in-a-lifetime trip. The reality of this place bears no resemblance whatsoever to the advertising. Promotional images and online listings show cows grazing on lush green fields in open countryside, suggesting a humane, natural farm environment. In reality, the animals we saw were kept almost entirely in concrete buildings with concrete floors, with no access to grass, natural habitat, or direct sunlight. The conditions were visibly dirty and bleak. The rabbits were the most distressing - confined to tiny, overcrowded cages, with multiple rabbits forced into each small enclosure, unable to move freely or behave naturally. The goats were kept in cramped box-like pens, often with three or four goats squeezed into a space barely large enough for one, including mothers and young separated into very small additional pens while the young feed and grow. Nothing about this felt educational, ethical, or aligned with modern animal welfare standards. Instead, it felt like animals were being displayed purely for tourism, with comfort and welfare coming far from second. To experience this on our honeymoon was genuinely upsetting, and we left feeling saddened rather than enriched. Based on what we personally witnessed, the marketing imagery is misleading, and visitors who care about animals should be aware that what is shown online does not reflect the conditions on site. To top it off, we found it extremely hypocritical and ironic that during our visit we encountered a sign which read ‘obstructions and cruelty to animals is a punishable offence’. If this statement were true, this entire facility would have been shut down a long time ago. I would strongly not recommend this place to anyone expecting a humane, open, or natural farm environment.","January 12, 2026"

Once we entered into the farm, we straightaway went to the cafeteria as we didn't have breakfast. We got  shocked to see hundreds of flies on and over each table. Leftovers we not cleaned from the table. We left the place ASAP and started viewing the animal shelters. It was very untidy. Almost all the shelters and feeding yards were filled with a worst smell of the uncleaned, unremoved animal excreta. Very few cleaning staff were working which seemed to be inadequate for such a mass scale farm. Then we moved to the place where cheese is processed. It was kind of a satisfactory place but definitely not excellent as we imagine while seeing the super looking Ambewela cheese at the supermarkets. Then there is a cheese selling counter where we found dirty sediments and stains on the glass cabin where cheese was exhibited for sale. And the worst case, a cleaning staff asked money from us to buy things for upcoming new year. Of course we gave a good money to that ill looking poor lady. But it raises serious questions about the staff welfare. Beyond all pitfalls, there are some positive things to find, the location and the animals. The scenic nature of the road to the farm and the farm's location are just awesome. Animals were healthy and active. Veterinary care must be up to the standards. Need to maintain international standards on cleanliness. Won't recommend as a must to see kind of place. Pay a visit if you have enough time and finished with other attractions at Nuwara Eliya.","June 10, 2019"

Buying the products was also nearly impossible - only the snack bar and restaurant sold the the cheeses, and since we visited on a holiday and the places were teeming with schoolkids, this was a battle. A separate outlet for selling the products, and a greater product variety could easily be arranged. If they don't want each and every visitor in their cheese factory, an entrance fee can be charged. Methinks the owners are only interested in the manufacturing aspect here. Marketing must be improved considerably. Why open your doors to visitors if you have not thought through the entire process??! You have an excellent product here. Market it better at its origins.

But, if you look closely, you'll see that the cows aren't that restricted from moving. These are a type of tie-stall where the caretakers are able to provide individualized attention and care for the expectant cows, and makes it easier for them to identify any inconsistencies in a cow’s daily activity. The rabbits are bred for meat which is rather cruel, but they are also being sold as pets. The goats are bred for milk and meat.

Spent good 3 hours just walking and seeing the operations of the farm itself. If one is really in to learning about cattle farming, then this is a must visit, as the farm consist of more details on cattle farming, with different section to identify different stages of cattle farming. Whilst cattle can be seen as the main attraction time spent there is fully worth it, if you could visit the goats and rabbit sections as well. The place has one restaurant, with one section being and open section and the other a closed one where the general stink of the farm is kept away. Depending on the individuals, it is up to you to select which section to be used to enjoy some refreshment. Washroom facilities were available, and to my dismay it was not maintained and not up to standards. Would appreciate it authorities can look in to this as resolve. I am sure with the ticket being bought at the entrance the other revenue you generate from the visitors from purchase of goods, you may be able to maintain a more decent washroom facilities than this. Beyond the farm, the drive to the farm is a very pleasant one with one driving through dense woods, open plains covered in grass, which is a great wive, and for someone who is interested in taking landscape photography, i am sure this would a heaven. For those interested in wildlife, if you do drive slow and be attentive, you may catch the glimpse of bear face monkeys, oriental white eye, scaly breasted munia and a small quireel that is the colour of dark chocolate with no stripes to name a few.","September 18, 2016"

If you are so desperate to see cows take a jacket with you and one more thing the place stinks of cow piss and turd. Avoid at all cost!,"July 13, 2016"

One can also have a look at the milking of the cows if lucky to reach at the particular time. We reached at 12:30pm and were fortunate to have a peep at it. There are different sheds where one can even have a look at the humongous Bulls, just born calves, grown up calves, expecting mother cows. Also the farm breeds Netherland goats and super huge rabbits. The baby calves are too cute. The amazing part about the entire farm is, the way everything is very well maintained and kept clean at all times. Also they have the cheese manufacturing unit and a cafeteria where one can have all kind of milk products. Their drinking yoghurt is worth trying. Photography is not allowed once you enter the main farm, but you can photograph the huge number of lazing around cows in the lush Greenlands while on your way.

So we just walked around and saw a few sheds of pregnant cows, stud bulls and calves and a rather depressing shed containing rabbits in cramped cages. There are no sheds of goats or pigs. The cheese making unit wasn't functional. There is a small shop that serves products made there but you can get the same products at any regular grocery store in town. We witnessed the milking session which happens at various times of the day, but again, nothing spectacular - machines attached to the cows' udders to pump out the milk into large containers. The only beautiful part was the drive to Ambewala, and we got to see several cows grazing on vast green lands.

Train Nanuoya to Ambewela 20min-15LKR (Ella train) (You can enjoy stunning views over farms, tea plantations, Horton Plain and waterfalls) 3. Walk from Ambewela train station to Ambewela Farm 30min-free :) (You won't miss the farm sign. The road is really well maintained, views are gorgeous, generally a pleasant walk) 4. Farm admission fee is 200LKR for adults, kids -1/2price Inside there are cows, baby cows, goats, rabbits and a small cheese factory. To be honest, nothing expressive. Sheds are very smelly, animals are a bit dirty, no information about the farm history or how the cheese factory operates. Restaurant didn't have any proper meals (it was a big disappointment for us as we planned to have our lunch there). Should mention that the actual farm area is well looked after. Well, at this point you have to turn back and take the same road to the train station. 5.

We went as a group of 2 families with 4 kids and it was extremely fascinating experience for all 4 of them! They drive is very beautiful and picturesque - with hills covered in mist and dotted with cattle grazing around. Inside the farm, milking of the cows is something you'd like to watch, if you have kids along. There are also plenty of other farm animals like rabbits, billy goats for children to interact with. There is also a restaurant/ canteen inside where you can buy food but could work at being a little more clean and well maintained. On the whole, would definitely recommend this if you have small kids.","April 26, 2014"

The area close to the farm is really beautiful with flowers and lots of green pastures . The farm itself is quite smelly but I suppose that goes with the territory  . It was really sad to see the cows and goats in sheds which were dark and dingy and the rabbits in cages where they could not move. The cheese factory was closed when we went and the restaurant's idea of milk shake was a scoop of ice cream in a glass of milk.   Toilets were terrible. The only consolation was that the kids enjoyed feeding the goats !","April 27, 2013"

The place is also not maintained well and there is no staff around who is keen to guide the visitors despite the fact that there is a entry charge to get into the diary.

The scenic view and cool breeze is enough to attract anyone. I doesn't cost much either. Have good food, but the star attraction on food department is the Fresh Milk. They have also displayed all the products they manufacture in the food court. But my advice is to stick to the fresh stuff, since you can get the other stuff from any shop. Hmm.... well the farm animals are well maintained, little bit smelly but that goes with the territory I guess. Only bad think you can say is the ride, terrible road right up to the Railway crossing junction, beyond that the Farm has maintained the road well. So right upto that you have to stomach it and put up with the drive. Roads are narrow as well. On the way you can see the Ambewela Tank, with a small Dam constructed to hold water, to be supplied within the area.","May 4, 2012"
