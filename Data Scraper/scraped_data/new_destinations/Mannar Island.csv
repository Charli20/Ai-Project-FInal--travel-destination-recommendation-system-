The salt flats where flamingo migrate to are next to a set of road works and now the only way to see flamingo is to get up at 0500 before the traffic starts The beaches are mostly in use for fishing so are not nice or clean enough to relax and enjoy The area also has a major problem with drug trafficking and drug taking. We found a nice beach area only to be joined by a group of locals doing cocaine On the positive side we enjoyed a couple of walks beside the salterns and saw lots of painted storks and pelicans,"February 12, 2020"

But it’s a must visit at least once. Mannar is famous for flamingoes in the migratory season. You can see them beside the road connecting Mannar and main island. Some of the major attractions are Mannar fort, thaleimannar pier and light house, thaleimannar beach, adam’s bridge, Keeri beach. The Adam’s bridge is a must visit from all of this. Specially visit in evenings, the sunset view would be amazing. If you can get navy permission they’ll take you on a boat ride towards the first island of town he adams bridge. On the way to Mannar you can visit Doric bungalow, arippu fort, Madhu church and thanthrimale temple.","November 28, 2019"

No fast food, just one supermarket, no traffic lights and NO TRAFFIC, but you enter a land where donkeys roam freely, Baobob trees grow amidst the thorny shrub, desolate white sandy landscape stretches for miles. Near empty roads, lush Palmyra trees and birds, hundreds and hundreds of them everywhere.  If you go off the beaten track, there's a stretch of beach which is completely isolated in parts except for a tiny fishing village or two. The silence only punctuated by bird calls is therapeutic, to say the least. I am of couse referring to Mannar Island, rather than Mannar on mainland. The only tiny disappointment was the Mannar Fort but the huge Baobob tree, supposedly over 800years old and, 22.8 metres in circumference, made up for it. The drive to Talaimannar Pier is absolutely beautiful,  hardly a single vehicle passes by. As if all this is not enough, a Donkey Clinic!!, over 30 donkeys live there and one can feed and pet them. We're definitely going back for the birding season, which is from November to around March I believe.","August 17, 2019"

Located in the North West of Sri Lanka, the island is now connected to the mainland by way of causeways, creating easy access to this strange little place, full of donkeys, people and peculiar mannerisms. Mannar incidentally is the closest point to India and on a clear day, when the tide is low you can almost see our neighbours above us. Mythic tales tell of an invisible bride binding the 2 nations together, woven by jewels left like a Hansel and Gretel narrative by Sita when she was taken by King Ravana to Lanka. But this is 21st century Mannar and mythology has become a modern thing; multiple faiths and ethnicities reside here – as do multiple species of animals. You might find stray dogs meandering the streets elsewhere in Sri Lanka, but in Mannar, donkeys rule the streets. Old, abandoned houses named in honour of women with English names sit on lonely streets where two wheelers and four-legged ones occupy rush hour and colonial forts sit abandoned on the edge of little towns.

It's 30 km long and a few kilometres wide - in some places more than 10 km. It's part of the hot Northern province of Sri Lanka more than 300km away from the capital city of Colombo. It's human settlements have a colonial origin comprising Dutch Fort, numerous churches. The island is populated by Tamil Christians and Muslims using Tamil as the widely spoken language. The main source of income for the people here is fishing. However, tourism is beginning to play a major role, too. There's a saltern on the western side of the city. The city is dead on Sundays with most businesses closed to the public. Only a few convenience stores and restaurants are open on Sundays including the much talked about Choice restaurant. The island doesn’t still have many places for tourists to stay. There are only a couple of luxury accommodations in the island. There are a few comfortable budget accommodations, in addition. The main attraction of the island is as a birding site. During the migratory season November to March. Around 1000 Flamingos visit the island to feed on the crustaceans found in abundance in the saltern and other areas with shallow salty water pools. In January to early February beautiful pink color developing in primary feathers of Flamingos is a treat to the eyes of the birders - both local and foreign. Large amounts of Copper in the Crustaceans they feed on are responsible for this color. You must watch them flying to appreciate the true beauty! But, please don't try to chase them so that they fly for you to see this magical display. If you wait long enough at a safe distance away they will eventually fly above you, especially if you are lucky! If they do you should certainly try your luck in whatever way you like for the day!  In addition to the Flamingos there are numerous other birds to watch, especially several species of Ducks, Glossy ibis, Western reef heron etc. You got to be in field before the sunrise to witness the birds in their true glory. You must make it a point to visit Thalaimannar area as well for the scintillating ride and the sights including the old pier, fishing harbour with an abundance of terns and gulls in addition to egrets and birds of prey fighting for fish thrown away by the fishermen. The other attractions of the island include the giant Baobab tree near the city,  the Dutch Fort,  Adam's bridge etc. Wankalai sanctuary is only a few kilometres from the island on the main land which is home to a large population of migratory water birds. Driving on your own in this sparsely populated island is a delight. You can make the best use of your stay if you can spare at least three days here. You can reach the island by car, bus or train. Train and bus rides can be harder during hotter months as air conditioning is not commonplace in public transport to this part of the country. If you have a genuine 4 WD vehicle it's possible to take a memorable drive to Mannar from Puttalam, through the Wilpattu jungle during certain times of the year when the gravel road is not flooded.","January 21, 2019"

We were unfortunate during our first visit as the Flamingos kept far out in the sea near the causeway.  We were lucky during the second visit!! They were there in their hundreds at the Mannar Salterns.  They arrived early morning around 0600 and kept feeding in the semi-saline waters while making their typical clucking noise.  It was a beautiful sight to see them coming on to land with the sun shining on them against the blue sky.  There were quite a crowd gathered there to witness this scene that happens only during the migratory season from about December to February each year.  We were advised to wear dull coloured clothing and not move too close to the group of birds to avoid scaring them away.  There were bird-watchers with binoculars and photographers with long-lens cameras feasting their eyes on the flock of beautiful pinkish birds. In addition to the Flamingos we also visited the Pesalai, a fishing beach where there were many birds such as gulls, terns, and brahimini kites.  We also visited Thiruketheeswaran temple and the famed Baobab tree.  In the evenings we went around looking for other migratory birds.  There are many places of interest around this little islet, Mannar, that we had visited in our previous annual visits. The main road from Mannar to Talaimannar is not in very good state rutted with potholes.  There were not many tourists too other than those who came to see the birds.  It is not a very busy place.  The seafood in many a local eating houses were spicy and tasty. We will go there again next year!!","January 18, 2019"

The ocean on both sides and the blue skies above it is almost like a postcard! The first attraction you will spot when you get into Mannar is the dutch fort. Definitely worth a visit! Most of the fort is intact and you can walk around and take some photos of the ocean from up there. Further down the road, you can visit the Baobob tree which is the tree with the largest bark in Sri Lanka. The tree is not native to Sri Lanka so its a mystery as to how it actually got there! Rumor has it that Arabian sailors brought it over ;) From Mannar town, you can drive up to Talaimannar which is home to the naval base and Talaimannar pier. The pier was used to board ships which go to India back in the day. Sadly, the ferry service is no longer active. On the drive to Talaimannar you pass beautiful scenery on both sides of the road. If you get down and walk off the road you will see that the white sand is covered by beautiful little shells! The area is aptly named the Shell coast cos of this. Right along the drive you will see heaps of Donkeys strolling along the sides of the roads which is quite and unusual sight for Sri Lanka :) The island has its own little post office which is the furthest most post office towards the west of the island. We bought some post cards and sent it across to ourselves from there as a fun little souvenir :) When back in town, make sure to visit Choice restaurant which is a small cheap food shop. Amazing fried rice and Biriyani available for Lunch and dinner. 5 of us had food and drinks, and the bill came to only LKR 1,500.00 Mannar island is definitely a must see for all locals and foreigners :) Just make sure to hire or drive your own vehicle since there is a lot of driving around to do :)","September 19, 2017"

Baobab tress and donkeys are a reminder of this even to this date, that traders from Arabia frequented this place. The fact that dutch chose to build a fort also goes to prove its bygone hub status. Kuweni, as the legend has it is from Thambapanni which is in Mannar district of Wilpattu reserve though not in the island. Adam's bridge or Hanuman's bridge also is there though there are no formal tours. Modi went to Talai Mannar to initiate a train service back in 2015 is still showing its strategic value to be connecting point to the Asian Railway Network. Wild Life Mannar sees migratory birds during seasons, especially flamingoes. Wild donkeys and poneys too can be seen. Coral reafs are also available. Again no formal tours In past, mannar was famous for natural pearls; though it is not commercially done now at large scale. Go to keeri beach Economy Economy is mainly based on fishing and agriculture. Food If you are in mannar, eat sea food. Prawns and cuttle fish are out of the world, but you need to get them fresh and cook. Only one proper resturant imo (Palmyrah). THough small shops also serve tasty curry. I am told cargills has opened in mannar town; please check. If not, take plenty of water bottles. Travel No 95 petrol is available in the island, Last station apparently is in Madu.

It was badly affected by the war and is only now starting to get back on its feet. It's a different experience to the rest of Sri Lanka and is worth a day or two side tour. You can arrive via bus or train. The journey across the causeway to the island is beautiful at high tide. There are donkeys throughout the island left by Arab traders. The donkeys are small but quite tame. They were the local taxi service for centuries but have been neglected with arrival of motorised vehicles. Bridging Lanka (48 New Moor st) are setting up a donkey education centre just outside town. They will shortly be running tours to try fund caring for these donkeys - contact them if you want to try set up a tour as we got to pat some beautiful well cared for donkeys in our visit. The baobab tree dates from the 1400s and is enormous. The local cathedral is nice. The Dutch fortress Is just at the end of the causeway on the island while it's small and was used during the war, you get great views from the walls.Just across the causeway on the Jaffna road is an ancient Hindu temple (Ketheeswaram) which is spectacular - and not a tourist in sight (remove shoes, men must remove their shirts and women must have shoulders and knees covered). Part of the temple is being restored and you can walk around the building site (!).  The Giants tank is a well known bird watching spot. Baobab guest house can provide tasty lunch for about $5 (if you want curry and rice they need a few hours notice but if you want egg and toast, shanthi can whip that up quickly) or the local ahash hotel was about the same cost. Mannar may not have the highlights of other parts of Sri Lanka but if you want to know what life is like for everyday Sri Lankans then this is a lovely stop over between Anuradhapura and Jaffna.","June 9, 2017"

Mannar and the associated tip  of the island,Talaimannar form the bottom claw of the Jaffna pincers extending into the sea. Mannar is slightly inland and Talaimannar is the tip. The two reasons why any visitor would want to visit this place are birds and history. The birds are quite exotic and plentiful in the area. The historical currency of this place is enhanced by the tale of Ramayana, an enduring epic in Sri Lanka and India. Talaimannar forms the Eastern edge of the fabled Adams bridge. On a good day and low tide, you can see the opposite end of these sand bars. That's all there is for the itinerant visitor. The drive from Mannar to Talaimannar is an hour an a half. The roads get progressively worse. Lot of military presence and a naval detachment right at the very tip of Talaimannar is a bit of a dampener. To reach the closest sandbars,called island 1 and 2, the help of local fishermen needs to be requisitioned. From the Indian side,Dhanushkodi,access to the sandbars is better. Reaching Mannar from central Lanka is on the A14. From the North,it is the A14. The roads are black tops for much of the way. Closing Mannar,the roads are not well lit and rough for long stretches. Advise against driving in the night. The arterial roads are patrolled by the police actively. Max speed is 70 kmph. In town limits are 40 to 50 kmph. The approach roads roads unlike much of Sri lanka are straight and don't wind. Food and overnight residence in Mannar are limited and average. It would help to carry food of choice and be prepared to stay in basic lodgings. An overnight stay with food should be no more than 60 usd per person. This is Mannar. Talaimannar has no amenities. Plan all trips by day. Avoid the rainy season. The local food is delicious but fiery. Breakdowns on the roads can ruin your timetable.Four wheel drives are best and a local guide recommended. Hospitality is unflaggingly super. Enjoy the trip !","April 19, 2017"

The building is in ruins and could be better managed by the authorities.  We also visited the light house and the Dutch Fort.

This is the largest Island belongs to Sri Lanka ( nearly 40 km in length and average 3 km in width. connected to the main land by a 3 km long road and a bridge at the entrance to the island. The sea which is on the both side of the road is just 2 feet deep in the high tide and becomes a massive dessert of white sand during law tide. Main attractions - Mannar Fort can be seen on your left when you enter the island. This was originally built by the Portuguese and further fortified by the Dutch and British and is still in a pretty good condition, and now are under preservation project of the Archaeological Department.  No tickets needed. There are few Dutch Tombs in the premises. - Adams Bridge at Thalei Mannar- Located around 35 km away from the Mannar town, Can be reached by Mannar - Thalai Mannar main road by Bus and Train. Public transportation goes only up to the Talai Mannar small town. The Adam's Bridge is the narrow belt of sand reefs and atolls runs from Thalai Mannar to Danushkodi at Pamban Island of India. Approximately 30 km in length  200 m in average width and 2 ft in average elevation , controlled by Sri Lanka Navy. During the day time between 7 am to 4 pm visitors can go there on private boats that can be arranged talking to any of the fishermen living there. In October 2015 it was 2500 rupees for a pack of 6 people for a 2 hrs visit. The boater should provide slandered life jackets to all the passengers and passengers must be wearing it all the time they are on board. if not sometimes the Navy even will send you all the way back to the shore cancelling your trip. after 4 pm you can not stay there under any circumstances. hope this will change in the near future to a level that you can camp in the night with special permission. Extremely warm and dry, better keep hydrating yourself through out the journey. - Fort Arippu - A small fort located on the road to Puththalama via Silavathurai. You can see the ruins of a small fortification originally done by the Portuguese and occupied by the Dutch and the British latter. - Doric Mansion - Located on the shore on the same road passing the Fort Arippu. One of the mansions of the 1st British Governor of Sri Lanka (then Ceylon). The mansion is in ruin but still you can see the great brick walls and arches. Kudhiramale Cliffs point in the shore of Vipattu forest, Thiruketheeshvaram Hindhu Temple, The Giant Tank, The Catholic Shrine of Madu, St. Lucia church, Baiobab trees, Sandy jungle beaches and couple of sanctuaries are located in the Mannar island and the adjoining main land. I first visited Mannar in 2010 and have gone there more than 20 times. Nothing much in terms of entertainment. but if you are interested in just observing a unique social set up, some of the oldest catholic customs in the south Asia, and colonial History, Mannar is awesome.  Not very developed in comparison to the other parts of the  country. Around 20 Hotels are found in the area. one of the hottest and driest climate in the country.","October 12, 2015"

Old train road and the pier still there.(Please check with Navy who is in the town whether you can visit because some days it is closed by them) Mannar is getting busy these days, another city in SriLanka. You do see lots of wild Donkeys in this area be careful, they can kick and harm you (not always but there are several incidents) It is fun to watch them, some times they stand still all of a sudden they run or scream, real fun. There are few places to stay Sorry, I did not stay there so no comment. In short it is a dry but charming place.","September 4, 2013"

However accommodation options were less, unless you're fine with guesthouses. There're so many things to see in this lovely city. We set out from Colombo & took a short cut via the Oyamaduwa road which bypassed Medawachchiya & saved us about 45 minutes drive time. First we visited the Kunchikulam Suspension Bridge en route to Mannar. This was one of the hidden gems which is still standing strong. However the road leading upto the bridge was a bit damaged. Afterwards we proceeded to Thiruketishwaram Kovil & Madhu Church. Both very beautiful sites. Spent the night in a nice clean guesthouse which was well worth the money we paid. The next day morning we visited Talaimannar & took a boat trip to Adam's Bridge. This is another breathtaking experience. The Sri Lankan Navy operates this & if the Ocean is rough, they will not operate. Luckily it was a good day. In the afternoon we visited Arippu Fort which was a Dutch built Fort to which Robert Knox fled while escaping from the Kandyan King during ancient times. Close to the fort is the Dorric House which was the bungalow of the 1st British Governor of Sri Lanka - Fredrick North. Better hurry since this site is at the edge of a cliff & parts of it is being washed to the Ocean. After several years, the entire site will be gone. The road to Arripu from Mannar was a bit bumpy. Spent the night at our cozy guesthouse. Next day morning visited the Vankalai Bird Sanctuary which was a major success for us. I'm not that much into birds, but still I enjoyed seeing so many different birds at that time of the day. In the afternoon we visited the Mannar fort & proceeded back to Colombo.","June 18, 2013"

The two famed places of worship on the A14, the beautiful island of Mannar and its beaches and the amazing Adam's bridge, add the Palmyrah House to that - great!","May 5, 2013"

A new road and railway  line are under construction and could reduce the travelling time -- but six/ seven hours , with a couple of rest stops , was not a problem and we arrived at our destination in great shape. Our group of nine spent two days here, relaxing and exploring. Mannar has much to offer -- it is off the beaten track so there are no crowds and this is a great plus point ( let's hope it stays that way ). Great beaches, bird watching during the winter bird migration, sea food, gorgeous sunsets , a boat trip to the Adam's Bridge causeway are a few of the things you could do here. Madhu Church ( one of Sri Lanka's most important Catholic pilgrimage sites ) is just half an hour away. Accommodation is limited at the moment -- but there are some surprisingly good options.  We stayed at The Palmyrah House, which is a perfect little five bedroom boutique hotel. We loved it and plan to return soon.","April 30, 2013"

We saw migrant birds  Greater Flamingos more than 1000, black tail godwits, Gargneys, Pintail ducks, Gulls, Plovers, terns all in flocks of several hundreds. So many raptors, white bellied sea eagles, brahamin kites, black kites, common kestrels and one booted eagle seen. In addition crab plovers more than 100 and pied avocet around 50 were spotted. For one day we have seen more than 1000 birds. It was really a paradise for bird watchers.","February 26, 2013"
