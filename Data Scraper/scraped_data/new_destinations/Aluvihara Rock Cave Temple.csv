It's a small cave cave temple but highly significant to the history of Buddhism. During the 1st century BCE, the island was ravaged by anarchy and starvation, and the very survival of Buddhism was threatened. This was because at the time, its teachings were orally transmitted by monks, and many had died or left the island. Some of the surviving monks then decided to commit the whole of the Thripitaka to writing. The forth Buddhist council was convened and as  a result, it was written down for the first time in the island's history. In this way, the teachings were preserved in it's original form and Buddhism survived this difficult period. The momentous event was held at the Aluvihara cave temple, originally known as the Aloka Lena , or ""Cave of Light"".","October 14, 2018"

It's built on a hill, and not as well-known as the ones at Dambulla. Because of this, there are hardly any visitors, and you can wander around peacefully. The importance of this place is that it was where the teachings of the Budhha were first written down, after five hundred years of word of mouth teaching.  It is in a lovely setting. You can combine the visit of Aluvihara Rock temple with the Hindu temple in Matale. It is similar in style to Dambulla, although not as spectacular, this temple was worth visiting. The entry fee is not much and it is Rs 200 per head. There is no charges on parking. It is well worth a visit while passing for an interesting small hour. It is a bit of a walk up to the cave, but it is well worth it. It is a very interesting and peaceful place to wander around but very different from the normal temples. Monks accommodation looked far better and felt donations directed to the monastery is good. Very few tourists found there and this made the experience quite different from Dambulla with its crowds. On the way to Dambulla we stopped at Matale and were pleasantly surprised at seeing things there. It is a nice complex of cave temples after a small climb up some with stairs. There were Dambulla like caves only but much smaller and much quieter. No-one trying to sell you stuff in the premises. Some caves, shows devilish torture depictures and therefore not suitable for kids which is only in one. The view from the top is nice.  The location is very clean and gives such an amazing views. There were graphic images and statues.   If atmosphere is cool enough, can hike 1km up the hill to a location of the Buddha viewpoint. The climb is also not a lot. People around are friendly.

Can use public transport as well. Plenty of buses are working. If you are a Buddhist pilgrim, it is an important place to worship because of the Tripitaka writings. If you are a history lover, think about the ancient technology used to write on Ola leaves. Those are the earliest evidences of proper writing systems in Asian history. If you are a linguist, think about the styles of Sinhala scripts, how well Sinhala language is structured. There is plenty of parking space available. Not crowded during weekdays.

This is a very significant place for Buddhists and appreciating why is the least a visitor can do to show respect. To fully understand how these caves came about and why, it's worth taking 5 minutes to read up about it. The ceilings are beautifully painted and whilst one cave may depict peace and serenity, in the next the cave paintings are a true revelation into just how nasty the afterlife could be if you sinned; extremely graphic and gory depictions of torture and execution. When you think you have seen it all there's a very strange cave with models along the same line, which depicts what the king would do to sinners. It's a little odd compared to the other caves which are more connected to Buddha. This particular cave is not really suitable for small children. A worthwhile little visit.","February 7, 2016"

Luckily someone told us as it's not obvious where to get them. OK so you also need to have your legs covered so wear long trousers. When you get to the caves go to the far end and start there, that way you see the smallest first and save the best for last! Worth the climb but do take some water.","February 26, 2015"

Some people we saw came up the mountain without tickets - perhaps chancing their arm - but were told that money could not be accepted and they would have to return to base and then come back.

Not only is the Rock Temple in Dambulla NOTHING like the Temple of the Tooth, but it was easily one of my favourite places that we visited in Sri Lanka. The temple itself is so fascinating, the way it's carved into the rock and how every inch of the cave is covered in beautiful paintings. I found it incredibly moving to be there, to the point where it brought me to tears. We took some time to meditate and were fortunate enough to witness a beautiful sunset from up on the hill.

The view from the top of the surrounding area is impressive and the caves themselves are fairly impressive however I have seen a lot of Buddhist temples and they are all very similar these are no more impressive than most. Few things to note - make sure you buy a ticket prior to going up the steps, take water as surprisingly there is none available to buy at the grounds, cover your knees and shoulders otherwise you will not be allowed to enter the caves this includes both men and women. At the top of the steps before entering the caves you will be told to leave your shoes for a charge and he will say you are not allowed to carry them however we just put them in our bag and had no problem with this also there is some walking to do once you remove your shoes so may be handy to take socks as the ground is really hot and burnt our feet!!

Another had murals of the punishment for sins in hell – very graphic, and somewhat disturbing.  Took stairs to the top of the rock bluff w/ beautiful view and a group of 5 playful monkeys, including a couple babies.  Very spiritual place, but caves were not very well let, so was dificult to see. Liked that it was much more intimate and less crowded than the Dambulla caves, but if you only have time to do one, I'd definitely do Dambulla - so impressive.","March 25, 2013"

There are some lifesize 'sinners'  made of plaster (I think) behind cages and a few more original/older wall murals.  It was annoying that the 'guardians' expected extra tips/donations to go inside each cave site - the only place I experienced that in Sri Lanka.

Still there are rocks. u have to climb up. u can imagine those was giant's cooking pot! we were there at ""poya' means full moon. many people came for prayer wearing white dresses. we joined them, they dont mind. there is some peculiar cartoonish pics on wall describing punishments of sinners afterlife. i was wondering as far as i know Buddhism is not about crime and punishment. there is no hell or haven in Buddhism. i was confused and there was not to explain. from the the top u can enjoy the scenic beauty and a statue of Buddha from another hill which is very far. we really appreciated local cone ice cream at the foot of the rock after get down.","December 1, 2011"

Better be a devout buddhist, because things that happen to you when in buddhist hell are beyond description, but very clear in the numerous murals.
