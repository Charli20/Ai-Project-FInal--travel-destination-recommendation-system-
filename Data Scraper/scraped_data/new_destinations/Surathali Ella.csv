This is on the Colombo Badulla main road arround 10km after Belihuloya, as we were going from Balangoda. It is verymuch closer to the main road but to reach to the bottom of the fall need to walk a bit. But not a hard.","March 18, 2021"

In Colombo - Badulla main road, pass Belihul Oya, then Pambahinna and drive another 7-8 km. Since there's no sign board available, check for the Bridge with a bend. The footpath is on the left hand side just before the bridge. There's plenty of space nearby the road for parking. The waterfall is only visible if you are traveling toward Colombo. Ask for directions from the the small shops. If you are using public transport, let the bus conductor know that you want to get down at Surathali Ella. They will help. This is a very safe place. No steep climbing. Even safe for bathing in shallow natural pools down stream. Kids can enjoy. Since no monitoring from an authority, there's no fee for entering the place. Keep the place clean please.","December 16, 2019"

Mostly an easy walk, with a couple of points you'd have to clamber a bit (though this was easily negotiated with even a 4 year old and a 60+ year old being part of our group). Fairly nice photo-friendly waterfall, not the highest but with a nice cascade. There are a couple of bathing spots (one easily accessible, one a slightly higher up steeper climb) that also seemed nice.","April 21, 2019"
