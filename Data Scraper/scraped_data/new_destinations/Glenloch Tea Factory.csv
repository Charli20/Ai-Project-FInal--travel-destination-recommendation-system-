Sri Lanka’s central highlands offer these perfect conditions: high altitudes provide cool temperatures, high humidity, and plentiful, well-distributed rain to hydrate the vegetation. It is this ""Goldilocks zone"" that allows the slow growth necessary for complex flavors to develop in high-quality tea leaves. A visit to the Glenloch Tea estate immerses you in this environment, featuring a tour of the lush tea fields, the intricate leaf processing factory, and a tasting session. Afterward, guests can explore a well-stocked, if relatively expensive, gift shop to purchase their favorite blends.","November 5, 2025"

The tour started with a visit inside the factory. From here we went outside into the tea plantation where I had a small look into the life of a picker. My last stop was a visit to the cafe where I was treated to a tasting of 4 different teas. Make sure you treat your self to a cholesterol or other treat too! I finished my tour off with a visit to the shop to purchase some tea to take home with me to Australia. The tour itself was free, I just tipped my lovely guide!","September 24, 2025"

Work and smiles. Sri Lanka on this visit.,5,Couples,Being greeted by a kind person who accompanied us to the factory explaining carefully all the processing procedures and the methods and machinery used could already be worth the visit. But shaking hands with the people who responded to our greeting during their work was even more beautiful.  There is a tourist and marketing part that consists of proposing to buy sweets to associate with the tea that you will taste and that you will later be invited to buy. But honestly the thing is not too insistent; moreover for us who were accompanied by a local driver there was no entrance fee but only a final free offer. Therefore also assessable based on purchases made or not. The view of the plantations is a magnificent panorama and having been able to try to pick tea in typical dress is something I will never forget. Thank you.,"May 23, 2025"

It was a fascinating insight into a product that so many people enjoy. None of it is staged (although there is some now redundant equipment around to help explain how things were done before some parts of the process were mechanised) so you are seeing tea which well end up in your tea back home being processed. At the end of the tour you are invited to try some of the teas and of course purchase some if you wish.  You can also wander around outside and see people picking tea.

The amazing fresh tea smell permeates the air, and the landscape of Nuwara Eliya is beautiful.   Glenloch is no exception. Our guide to the tea factory spouted many dodgy facts about tea.  For example, she seemed to think black tea was high in vitamin C and had more vitamin C than green tea.   She did not know what fermentation or oxidation were.  When I asked questions to clarify her knowledge, she hit back by asking my travel partner whether I could understand English. Ouch!  She then treated me like a retard who couldn't understand what she was saying, which was totally fine with me, because I knew she didn't know even the basics of the tea making process.   I have attached a picture of the dodgy guide.   Surely it takes only 10minutes of reading Wikipedia to pass some basic facts on and she couldn't even do that. I've attached a pic of the guide. We didn't get a tour of the plantation outside.  We were told we could wander down the path/road to take a better look outside.  We weren't allowed to walk on the plantation slopes as a safety precaution. Once inside, we tasted just one type of tea. It was OK.   The shop was a bit overpriced.  I bought BOP tea in the cheapest packaging, it was 1000rupees. No discounts, no haggling.   Our driver was pretty happy because he got some free tea from the ladies there once we had made our purchases.  I think drivers who bring visitors to Glenloch obviously get perks which depend on how much their visitors spend -  that's enough incentive for them to choose this tea factory over others.  The tea itself tastes great.   Heaps better than the Dilmah you get in Australia. In this factory, the same tea gets packaged as different brands.  The price point is just determined by how fancy the brand is, which is mainly comes down to how beautiful the packaging is.   So you might as well buy the no frills packaging.","November 9, 2018"

While we were tasting our guide explained the health benefits if each. On site they had a chocoletier stand, and these chocolates were also delicious. Although compared to most places you visit in Sri Lanka, the tea that they sold was more expensive than any where else we had visited. The price is 100% worth it! my partner and I purchased both the golden flush, BOPF, BOP and silver tip tea, and all are fantastic. Tea picking!

Yes, there are opportunities to shop and tip here, but absolutely not the hard-sell you experience elsewhere - even in the tea shop. Afterwards, we got a tour of the fruit garden.

The first time I came, I realized that I had not bought enough tea, so I tried to buy more elsewhere in Sri Lanka. Bad mistake. I ended up being offered the same tea for ten times the price at several places in Mirissa. So the second time, I made sre to stock up. Our driver came in to check on us as we were checking out. He did a doubletake at the size of the stack of tea boxes we were buying. But the price cannot be beat, even elsewhere in country. They have both bags and loose leaf available. I really enjoy the factory tour. As others have noted, the tour is the factory side only. I also wish they would take us out in the plantation. But the factory tour is really interesting. It is amazing to see how much they produce in a relatively small place and learn about just how the tea is sold. (Hint: it is sold in international auctions held in Colombo). The tea here is really good. My friend bought some black tea and gave it to her son who promptly made a cup. He came in saying ""Oh my god, you have to try this tea!"" She responded ""Yes, yes. I have had black tea."" And he answered, ""Oh no you haven't! Not like this!"" I understand the tea did not last long and now my friend regrets not buying more. I too am completely spoiled by the quality. I tend to only drink Glenloch Sri Lanka tea. I never felt pressured to buy anything here. In fact, the first time I came, I sat in their tasting room for hours just enjoying the gorgeous views and the excellent tea. On cup of white, one of black, one of green, and one of the golden flush (they won't tell you how they make that one). It was the first moment I truly relaxed and felt like I was on vacation. Next time I am in Sri Lanka, I will definitely stop by for more tea!","October 30, 2017"

The main reason for this is the water not the quality of the tea.","March 21, 2017"

Since it was after closing time, the machinery were not operational, but she gave us a full guided tour and was also able to answer most of our queries.  She was a very friendly individual and made sure that she went through the full tour, even for a group of 3 which comprised of 2 adults and 1 child. We were then lead to the tea shop, where we were given a cup of tea to sample.  Then, she showed us to all the various products that they had for sale. They had a decent selection of tea in various shapes and sizes.  The tea is of good quality, having tasted various flavors and selections from what we had bought.

When we checked into this beautiful hotel, we found out it has its own organic (which is a huge differentiator) tea plantation and factory which is available for tours, tastings, an experience plucking tea, and a gorgeous tea bar with tea available to purchase. The real kicker-   The organic tea from their estate is about 50% less then the Glenloch store.  Turns out this is likely because they have to pay the tour guide commission.

This one was recommended and organised by the local travel agent (ground agent for Kuoni). I imagine this is not dissimilar to other tea factory offerings and as far as I was concerned ticked all the relevant boxes. What surprised me most was that we were touring  a working, commercial operation and allowed to get up close and handle the (largely ancient) equipment and the tea in its different process stages. I was expecting something slightly more sanitised behind Perspex screens with UK-style endless warnings about health and safety etc but blessedly there was none of that. Our friendly guide gave us a brisk tour of the different stages but never hurried us when we wanted to look closer, take photos and generally dilly-dally taking the place in. Information she gave was hugely informative and I learnt a lot about the process. After the machinery we had a tea tasting of 4 of the teas (slightly disappointingly we were just left alone to sample while our guide disappeared - some tasting pointers or things to look out for would have added to the experience) then guided through the retail operation to part with money. We didn't mind and there is no obligation to buy anything and the prices were probably not unreasonable. Finally we had a brief tea-picking experience. Basket-strung-from-the-head photo opportunity rather than a picking experience but was good to do if only to appreciate how hard the real tea pickers work for their low wages. Doing this, my wife managed to pick up a leech too which wasn't part of the formal picking experience but served to again emphasise just one of the hazards of the job for real! (Could have been worse - could have been a venomous snake bite!). A must do if you love tea and this was a good tour in a real working factory with an enthusiastic guide.","November 14, 2016"

Seeing the whole process of how tea is made was really interesting and I was surprised to learn that all different types of tea come from the same plant just a different leaf! I always assumed it was a different tea plant all together. We got to taste the tea afterwards and after tasting how fresh and how creamy the taste was, of course we had to buy some! I will be absolutely gutted when I run out of the tea! It tastes amazing. Our tea back home is nothing in comparison to here. I definitely believe this is the place to visit if you want to see a tea plantation/factory. I was told by my driver that this is the only tea factory still owned by Sri Lanka. This was sad to learn. Please visit this place rather than the places owned by large corporations! You'll never taste tea better than you do here.

This factory really does allow you to get close and that is the best part and it is a smaller and ""friendlier"" place. The tea tasting is pushed a bit more as they do sell the different teas that are made there.","May 7, 2016"

We drink loads of tea; probably gallons of the stuff every day but we didn't really know how it went from plantation to cup. Our guide took us to this plantation on our way to Nuwara Eliya and the first thing we noticed were the breathtaking views; absolutely stunning vistas down the valley. We were taken into the 'tea factory' by a lovely young lady who proceeded to explain to us the end to end process from the leaves being tried, cut, sorted etc. The smell in there was amazing and we have since discovered that it is the same smell inside the pack of tea that we bought there. At the end of the educational tour, we were treated to a cup of the tea, which provided much needed refreshment after the heat of the factory. We bought several boxes of high quality tea for 1000LKR each, which is around £5 and seems expensive but it is absolutely genuine top grade tea and the taste is amazing. Plus, the tea bags are so strong that we use ours twice! If you're up this way then it's definitely worth a visit and a nice rest break from the road!","May 1, 2016"

Our guide processed us through the tour and told us the rolling machine was a cutter then offered us a cup of tea but seemed agitated when we actually wanted to drink it - she eventually (after about 5 minutes) exclaimed that she was going to leave to take another tour which was a relief but instead remained awkwardly until my wife gave in and we left our tea and went to the shop to buy something and be released from our shadow. As per many of these places, you're pressurised into buying at overinflated prices and if you're on a tour and trusting your guide you often end up falsely believing that the prices are actually normal or that you may not have a better chance to buy tea! The tea prices are determined by where you're from so if you can convince them you live in an ex-pat community in Galle then you may be onto a better deal? I dread to think how much less I could have paid buying premium Ceylon tea in the UK. Pedro was a nicer experience and there was no pressure - actually they didn't even bother to tell us there was a shop where we could buy souvenirs etc. It was 200 rupees for the tour but worth every one of the 100ish pennies that represents.","March 8, 2016"

The actual tea factory looks like every other one in the area, apparently using a design perfected in the 19th century, with machinery invariably from the UK.  It is however interesting to see the process in action, starting with a sort of fermentation where a lot of the water content is removed naturally, through a grinding into small segments and then a final drying.  The there's a lot more to it, particularly the blending, testing, tasting and packaging, but those are the initial steps. All the time specialised machinery is doing the real work. After an informative tour showing the process you are invited to a tasting session where you can try and distinguish between the various products.

A close French friend of mine visited there recently. She told me about her trip which was very interesting and the photos she took were amazing. Stunning views and an interesting tour of the tea making process from the tea leaf gathering in the fields to the factory. She brought me some of the tea back to try, knowing I love my tea. They do a wide variety of teas as you can see from the photos. I tried a full bodied black tea which came loose in a packet for preparing in a teapot. It similar to English Breakfast blend but with an unusual slightly earthy after-taste to it. Not nearly as good as the brands I drink in the UK. I was wondering if the tea was organic, completely natural or something, but my friend said not. One thing my friend told me which was interesting...she said a lot of the big tea brands that sell teabag tea, buy the ¨tea dust¨ (stuff they don´t sell themselves as it´s not good enough for loose tea) from the Glenloch Tea Factory. That surprised me. It just goes to show, brand names can be misleading and people are too trusting of them. You need to see where your tea comes from and how its prepared.","January 4, 2016"

They factory has a nice balcony where you can sample tea (we had four kinds: English Breakfast, Green, White, and Special). They were all quite good, and were a healthy sample size. The balcony overlooked a valley, and was quite a pleasant view. However, there is some major construction happening right below the balcony which was a bit noisy, but hopefully it will be terminated soon. The tour guides wanted to know if we wanted to eat, but all they had was mostly things we don't eat (breads, pasta, cake and cookies, etc), and it was on the pricey side, so we declined. However, the other guests seemed to like their food, so it might be a good place to eat. We were then taken on a factory and plantation tour, both which were very interesting since to that point I really didn't know how tea was made, and the difference between black, green, white, and a new tea that I had never heard of 'silver tip'. Apparently it is mainly about the different age of the leafs, and then their is very little difference aside from the fact that black tea is fermented and then dried, whereas the others are steamed. We then bought some tea in the gift shop, which was very reasonably priced, and then I went to have one more delicious green tea before we started to ride again. To my great surprise, they gave me the extra tea again for free since I had bought some tea in the gift shop. The gift shop had all sorts of teas, in all types of formats. They had all the teas mentioned in the samples above, and they had mixes with herbal ingredients. They also had most in loose and bad format. Lastly, they had packages in different sizes and containers. I wanted pure green tea, and I was offered a 200 gram loose tea in a simple box for 1100 rupees, or 100 gram in a display tin for 1000 rupees. Our tour guide was very nice, and was informed. Overall, if you like tea, or are just looking for a nice view, consider stopping here, or at one of the many tea plantations along the way.","December 24, 2015"

The tour of the factory was detailed and the guide was very informative. He told us to pose near the tea for photos etc and took some photos for us. We viewed the whole tea making process, which was fascinating. However, at the end of the tour we were taken up to a terrace and provided with a cup of tea (which tasted fantastic by the way) and the guide stood over us, clearly waiting for a tip. My husband explained to him that our other guide (who was driving us around for the whole trip) had not yet taken us to a cash machine and so we had no money to give for a tip. We apologised profusely, however the man just stayed there stood over us, which made us feel very uncomfortable. After a while he gave up, a lady came over and took our cups away quite rudely. I was feeling quite mortified by this time and thought I would at least buy something from the gift shop with my bank card so that we would at least spend some money there. Again, the staff in the shop were abrupt, the lady who served me practically threw my bank card at me. We couldn't leave there quickly enough. I think it should be made much more clear that tips are expected here; we always tip generously, however I think sometimes it helps to remember that we had already paid several thousands of pounds for our holiday, which included the tour. It also wasn't our fault that our driver hadn't taken us to an ATM machine! (I had actually tried to take money out at the airport but he advised against it). I would recommend the trip, however please be advised that you will not be treated very nicely if you don't tip the guide.","November 17, 2015"

As we reached halfway back down the hill they started hassling us for money. This was not unexpected, but it saddened me.

The tea factory is a wonderful relic to the belief, that if it isn't broken, don't mend it and in common with other factories, the process has not changed throughout the centuries. Similarly, some of the machinery is well over a hundred years old and in fact the tea factory is in effect a working museum. Yes the tea in the shop is overpriced, we we found this to be true at other similar establishments and as for the taste...don't forget that the tea drunk in England is blended tea, a concoction very often of teas from a number of countries. Pure tea is often drunk without milk and can be an acquired taste. You cannot visit Sri Lanka without visiting a tea factory and Glenloch set in the uplands in Nuwara Eliya is a typical set up. People wanting tips is typical of the culture and tourists should not be surprised; wages are very low, so If you feel a service has been carried out, then a small reward could be given, but if not, keep your hands in your pockets.

As to the museum, our whole family enjoyed learning about tea and seeing the old British machinery from the 19th century.  It was easy to imagine the workings of the factory and it was an informative trip down memory lane.  I think the factory tour is free but the museum cost £2.50 to get in.

The friends who we gave the tea as gifts were, without exception, in agreement. I apologised to them. Maybe we bought a bad batch? So I emailed The Glenloch Tea Company and reported what, when and how it tasted. They didn’t answer let alone acknowledge. I checked the email address on their site several times and it was correct. I waited. Two weeks later I wrote again. No response. Two weeks again and I wrote now three weeks on and not even the courtesy of acknowledgement, a reply or even better an apology! I now believe that they must have so many complaints that they just don’t bother to answer.

However, our guide was very rude. We felt very rushed the whole time, he never fully answered our questions, and even though we tipped him more than we thought we should have, he asked for more. I was also very interested to try the different types of tea that they have (similar to wine tasting), yet they only gave us one complimentary cup of tea and did not even tell us which variety it was.

My husband gave him what we thought was a reasonable tip, considering there is a tip box in the shop, we shouldn't be expected to give twice.  He was the manager, was certainly on a better wage than the tea factory workers.  He mumbled something under his breath about the tip not being big enough.  We just politely smiled and walked away!!!
