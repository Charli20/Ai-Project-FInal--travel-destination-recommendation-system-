I drove along the 4-kilometer-long Uda Walawe dam on 26th November 2019, stopping at interesting locations to take photographs.  A two-lane road runs over the embankment of the dam, built across Walawe Ganga (river).  The 268 million cubic metres of water impounded by the dam provide irrigation facilities to 23600 hectares at both left and south banks of Walawe Ganga.  Two hydro-electric power plants installed at the head of the left and right bank canals generate 6 MW of electricity. The view across the dam is scenic, extending over to the distant hills beyond. The dam incorporates five spill gates on the left end. At the time of my visit, one of these was partially open with water gushing out over its spillway.  Visitors are not permitted to go downstream to watch this phenomenon as it is not considered safe. In addition to the gated spillway, the two power plants and the right and left bank canal outlets, there is a natural spillway, 366 metres long, built at the leftmost end of the dam to protect it against an unusually heavy flood.  The power station near the left bank power plant serves to connect the power plants into the national grid.  on that clear day when we drove over the dam, we enjoyed its large expanse of waters and the scenery extending up to the hills beyond.  We saw some waterfalls too in the distance.","November 30, 2019"

It is about 5 kilometers long. When you drive along or spend time on the dam, you would see the Udawalawe National Park with animals like deer and elephants. There is a famous elephant who use to visit the dam and expect food from people pass by; however, the authorities strongly discourage feeding this particular elephant (may be because of a recent incident with a drunk fool who almost got himself killed by the elephant by approaching in a very idiotic manner making the elephant nervous). The wind that flows above the dam is very strong; especially when you pass this place by a Safari jeep early  in the morning, it's a unique feeling which would only experience at this place. Compared to the other tourist attractions locations, this area consists of many honest people who wouldn't try to rip off visitors; rather we noticed that many people try to be satisfied with the good feedback they get in return for their honesty and good service. Therefore, I would recommend people to visit this place!","July 10, 2016"
