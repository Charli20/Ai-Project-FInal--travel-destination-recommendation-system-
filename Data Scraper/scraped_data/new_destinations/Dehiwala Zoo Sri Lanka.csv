About £10 per person for tourists which was ok. Quite an easy route to follow around . A reasonable array of animals but can’t say I felt comfortable seeing some of them in small areas for their size, eg Tigers, bears . Keepers made a point of letting tourists feed animals , nice touch. Lots of signs saying don’t throw rubbish! Waste of time given the amount rubbish we saw all over and in enclosures. Overall we found it pretty grubby and far too cramped for a good few animals of the larger variety. A very run down zoo.","January 4, 2026"

There are 3 different prices, Local, Tourist, and another that was less than Tourist but more than Visitor. If you have a Diplomatic ID you will get the local price which is 200LKR vs. The 4000LKR tourist price. The entrance line was hectic, and you had to stand your ground when people tried to cut, but it was very quick to get through (we went around 3 hrs before closing) As we walked around the animals were actually out and present which is a nice change from past experiences at other zoos. A Zoo employee offered us a guided tour, moving us around crowds providing us front views of the animals, and carried snacks and plants that he handed us to feed the animals. There was no agreed upon price for this tour, at the end it was simply put ""if you were happy with your experience please tip what youd like"" During the walk around another employer added himself onto our tour and also asked for tip, I tipped him less because I knew what the deal was but wanted to be appreciative of the assistance.  Although I am sure we were targeted for this guided tour because we were American, it honestly made my kids day and felt like VIP treatment, so I did not mind at all. We were able to get up close and Personal with both the Elephants and thw Giraffes and feed and touch them both. So I actually recommend the tour. It was hot so I suggest bringing water and a fan. But there are refreshment vendors on the path.","November 30, 2025"

As a traveler with a penchant for wildlife, this was a must-visit on my Sri Lankan itinerary. Stepping through the gates, the cacophony of animal calls replaced the city's honking symphony. My first stop was the elephant enclosure. These gentle giants, Sri Lanka's national treasure, were munching on hay. A sense of awe washed over me as I observed their wrinkled grey skin and intelligent eyes.  A young elephant playfully sprayed itself with water from its trunk, a gesture that made me chuckle. Next, the playful chatter of monkeys drew me in. The Sri Lanka Langurs, with their distinctive black faces, swung from branch to branch, seemingly unfazed by the watching crowd.  A troop of macaques squabbled over a fallen banana, their antics providing a moment of amusement. The roar of a lion echoed through the zoo, sending shivers down my spine.  Approaching the lion enclosure with a mix of anticipation and trepidation, I saw the majestic creature lounging in the shade. Its golden mane shimmered in the sunlight, and its powerful presence commanded respect. The Dehiwela Zoo isn't just about the big cats. I wandered past enclosures housing a variety of fascinating creatures, each with its own unique story.  The graceful peacocks strutted their vibrant feathers, the zebras grazed peacefully, and the giraffes stretched their long necks, offering a glimpse into their leafy breakfast. One of the highlights was the feeding time at the hippopotamus enclosure. These enormous creatures lumbered out of the water, eagerly awaiting their meal.  It was a sight that both impressed and slightly terrified me with their sheer size and powerful jaws.","April 2, 2024"

We went with family, who had in turn gone as children to this zoo - so it was a trip down memory lane for them. I was hoping there would be some element of care for the animals - after all, they advertise that you can see elephants, lions, bears, giraffes and more. I was incredibly shocked by what we saw. On arrival we learnt about the “World Children’s Day” event where staff proudly told us school kids are allowed to pet the lion cubs. I was shocked that anyone is allowed to handle the cubs - and can only image what is done to control the cubs in these circumstances (drugging, starvation, lack of water - all to control behaviour). Elephants are chained and poked into submission using ‘phaajaan’ and then made to parade, perform and “dance” - a tradition at this zoo dating back decades apparently. It’s disgusting to watch - much like the old circus activities that are Elephants balance on each other and form shapes. I was shocked at how many local people come here to cheer and champion this treatment, without any care for the treatment of the animals. I would have thought people are more educated about this in 2024 and should know how cruel this is! The worst thing was that there is no acknowledgement of how wrong it is to treat any animals this way. They are blatantly tortured and exploited for human entertainment - and tamed into submission in ways we all know are cruel. Yet people pay to see this. While this might be down to a lack of local education, I suspect that’s not the case in this day and age - rather that, at Dehiwala Zoo, making money is far more important than animal welfare. This zoo should be shut down, and I hope other travellers can help share this message so people do not spend their money here in future.","January 22, 2024"

But, lo and behold, a local woman came up and took me to the cash register. It turned out that “whites” were allowed in without a queue. The ticket price at that time (January 2023) was 3000 rupees. Now the price on the official website is $15. But payment is accepted only in local currency. Established in 1936, Dehiwala Zoo is one of the oldest zoos in Asia. It is located in the suburbs, just a few minutes' drive from the center of Colombo. The zoo is home to more than 300 different species of animals, birds, reptiles and fish from around the world. The animals live in large enclosures and are well cared for. The animals look healthy. I really liked the park's navigation. If you follow the signs, you will definitely not miss anything. And the territory of the zoo is not small. In addition to the main enclosures, there is a reptile corner, an aquarium, a “Bird House” and a “Butterfly Garden”. Unfortunately, the Butterfly Garden was not open on the day of my visit. All cages have a small sign with detailed information about the animal being kept in the cage, making a visit to the zoo very educational. Also at certain times (it is indicated on the back of the tickets) feeding of different animals takes place. For an additional fee, you can feed giraffes, pelicans, parrots and other birds yourself. And in a special arena with an amphitheater you can see the “Elephant Show”. I didn’t make it to the beginning because I didn’t calculate the time and was delayed at the other end of the zoo. Don't make the same mistakes I did if you want to watch the whole show. ) If you get hungry during or after your walk, at the entrance you will find sellers of street food and cotton candy. There are several kiosks throughout the zoo where you can buy drinks and snacks. There are many benches and gazebos in the park where you can sit down to rest, have a snack or hide from the rain. It is better to visit on weekdays when there are fewer people.","August 10, 2023"
