Its visible from the main road from Ramboda. If you want to get closer, you can take the Ulapane - Pussellawa Road. There are various ways to get to this road. You can either come from Gampola or Pussellawa/ Tawalantenne side. We started all the way from Ulapane (which was a bit of a detour) since we wanted to see the Fools Bridge, which is visible from the Ulapane bridge. There is also a hanging bridge and then you get to Kotmale bridge. Google map directions are accurate and the road is in good condition. You have to pass the dam which is on the right side of the road, towards Pussellawa side for about 500 meters. Then you come to an observation point. You need to get a ticket which allows you access to a look out point and a tiny museum. Then you can take the same ticket and go back to the dam which will allow you to walk the length of the dam. As soon as you pass the observation deck and go towards Pussellawa, you get a left turn to Mahaweli Maha Seya. On the way to Mahaweli maha seya you also get a right turn to see ""Dehadu Kadulla"". This is supposed to be an entrance gate in the border between Ruhuna and Malaya and the very gate used by Prince Gemunu around 2000 years ago!. It seems to be in perfectly good condition. So I am not sure whether this is the real thing or a replica based on folk lore. Once you pass the Kotmale dam and go towards Pussellawa in the Ulapane Pussallewa road, you get to Ranamune Raja pihilla, another landmark in prince Gamunu's story. This is a beautiful paddy field with ""out of this world"" views and a famed fountain. A little while after, this road meets the Talawakele - Tawalanetenne road. It's best to take that route to get to A5 as the Pussellawa Road in not in good conditon thereafter. Also, while the roads were in perfect conditon, there were not many places to have lunch after Gampola. When we visited the previous time, we went to the Kotmale rest house which was a left turn-off before coming to the dam. There was also a home stay kind of place, right next to Ranamune pihilla, but we couldn't figure out whether they served lunch or not. If you know prince gemunu's story or if you have followed ""Ganga Dinge"" this would be a perfect road trip. Even if that is not the case, this trip does offer lovely views and an added bonus is that it is a rarely travelled road, so you can enjoy its beauty in all its pristine glory .","October 21, 2025"

Next up is that you can walk over the dam, which also provides a good opportunity for some impressive photos.
