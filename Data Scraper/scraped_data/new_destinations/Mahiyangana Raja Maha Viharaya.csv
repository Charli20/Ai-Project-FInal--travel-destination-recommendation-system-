After parking our car, we walked along the 150 metre long eastern paved path leading to the gleaming bell shaped white stupa accentuated against the lush green mountain range beyond.  I later found that there are four entrances on the four sides.  At each of these entrances is a moon stone with carved animals, clearly wasted by the many feet trudging over them.  On either side of the moon stones are two sculpted guardian figures about 750mm high.  There were many devotees who had come to pay homage at this Stupa.  We joined them and circled around along with other devotees while capturing some interesting photographs. I learned that this had been the first stupa built in Sri Lanka.  Records show that it had been renovated by King Dutugamunu in the second century bc.  It had since been renovated on several occasions.  The height of the stupa stands at 120 feet (37 metres).  This is a prominent cultural attraction that had been declared as a protected archaeological site. On the western side of the Stupa sits the image house.  We saw many devotees there.  A Hindu kovil (temple) dedicated to the deity 'Saman' is also prominent.  No photographs were permitted within the image house and the kovil.  A sculpted statue of future Buddha Maitri sits behind the image house. Even though it was early morning on a weekday, there were many devotees paying their respects by offering flowers and engaging in prayers, seated on the white sands, in typical elevated - hands together posture. A new buddha statue that would be 84 feet (25.2m) high is under construction, a little away towards the south-east of the stupa. We spent a little over an hour at the Mahiyangana temple. Entrance to the temple is free. Visitors are expected to dress modestly and behave with decorum as well as remove their footwear before entering the temple premises.","August 14, 2019"

This is a review for Veddha people in Dambana Village near Mahiyanganaya, Sri Lanka (which I cannot find in any list of trip advisor). I was so eager to meet with these people, I visited their village and I tried to arrange a co-existance for 1-2 nights for the 3 of us of our group. First of all, the village was empty, then they would let us be with them without water supply, toilets and beds, just with 2 or 3 meals, they would show us the way they hunt (no hunting during August), they would show us some of their dance and songs... AND they asked for 70 euros per person per night. After our denial to accept this, we went to another settlement  near by to be informed that they would just arrange for a show with some music, dance and singing, then they would show us around the place and the way they hunt for 35 euros per person. Since our aim was to live with them some days we were so disappointed we left with the most negative impression. So, I can say without any fear, that the Veddha people attraction is a FRAUD...don't even bother to go and see them. As in most tourist attractions in Sri Lanka, their only aim is to get the ""bloody tourists'"" money and if you are sensitive enough, you will feel their dislike against ""westerners"" who they feel as responsible for all their poverty problems. I have to repeat what I say every time I write about Sri Lanka. It is one of the most beautiful countries I ever visited (top 3 of 35 I visited), its people are the sweetest of all I ever met, BUT in tourist industry they are unacceptable amateurs.","September 19, 2015"

You will love the ten kilometre, winding road that descends onto the plains of Uva Province. Sunrise and sunset are rather nice. There is a fee payable at the main ticketing box located opposite the main Vihara, where you will receive a lovely, glossy, folded information brochure. The grounds are expansive and photo opportunities are certainly available.... ... But not in the shrine room, of the main Vihara. The resident Sangha are friendly and welcoming. Bring 'dana' gifts and donation money with you, for the till boxes. Monks can only possess what is given too them. Unless the community provides, they go without. Shop in Kandy before arriving and fill up a big box full of things that you would appreciate having, if you were living life as a Monk. The museum is small and quaint. The local 'stray dogs' seem friendly. The most shocking accommodation options that I have seen in Sri Lanka are available. You're better off sleeping at the Monastery, returning to Kandy City or moving on (immediately) after your visit.","March 5, 2015"

Then the Lord Buddha preached Dhamma to Sumana Saman, a leader in this area, to whom the Lord Buddha gave a handful of his hair relic so that people could worship. After that Sumana Saman (now the God Sumana Saman) built a golden chethiya in which the sacred hair relic was deposited.
