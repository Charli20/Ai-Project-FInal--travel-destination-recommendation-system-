Google directions are accurate.... Wattegama - Elkaduwa road is slightly bumpy and narrow. There is a turnofff from this main road and you have travel about 1.5 kms to reach the waterfall. The access road was freshly carpeted at the time of our visit. The road is wide enough to park vehicles. There is a entranceway from where you have to buy a ticket (LKR 150 per local) and climb down a few steps leading to a pathway upto the waterfall. There is also a railing (not the safest though) which you can use to cross the waterfall in the middle. There was a summer hut, washrooms and a place to change clothes. It also seemed as if they have built a place to bathe as well. (Not so sure about this). The waterfall itself wasn't that impressive. (We visited a couple of weeks after heavy rains though). We went there on our way to Sembuwatte Lake and spent only around 20 mts there. (Hence our rating reflects only what we thought of the waterfall and the surrounding view.)","July 31, 2024"

However the pathway is slippery so watch out and also be careful with the Leeches. Carry salt water or sanitizer. Try to always get a guide to take you. They are simple folk at the ticket office. We were taken by Vishwanathan. Wear good shoes which have a decent grip. It’s a very short walk but best be safe than sorry!,"October 9, 2021"

It falls in 2 sections and when combined it is very wide. Recently some development activities have happened here to market this place as a leisure park. Some huts with sitting areas, a natural pool and changing rooms are available. But it’s not worth the 100 rupees entrance fee you have to pay. You can also walk up very closer to the waterfall. Parking area is also available.","December 19, 2018"

Be informed that if you are going near waterfall you have to buy a ticket of 300/= which is in my point of view not a reasonable charge. Be aware of leeches in raing season,"December 6, 2018"

We travelled by coach up to the parking area.  The entrance fee payable at the simple office at the entrance gate costs Rs 100 per person.  After purchasing the ticket, we walked along the designated path towards the upper reaches of the falls.  Although we were advised to take precautions, we encountered only a few leeches, possibly because it was a dry morning. You can see the falls from a distance as you come along the main road.  The falls consist of two sections that are distinctly different.  At the bottom of the falls is a small pond and a little hut where you can sit and enjoy the view.  The water fall is about 40 metres high.  The virgin beauty is unaffected as there are no commercial buildings nearby.  The path by the side of the falls is moist and slippery and visitors need to be careful of the thorny bushes along the way. We stayed here for about 90 minutes enjoying the quiet, the scenic beauty and the monkeys!","November 20, 2018"

Upper part is about 5m high and is situated within the hotel premises(2nd pic). Lower water fall is of 65m of height, comparatively larger (1st pic) and more beautiful. Both are real beauty of nature. Highly recommend to have a visit there.","October 31, 2018"

As you cannot really swim at the waterfall, they built a little rock pool, which looks a bit forgotten and is not very inviting to swim. If you pass by, it may be worth a shot, but don‘t expect a mind blowing waterfall to spend a day.","February 4, 2018"

This is along the Elkaduwa, Wattegama Road. a car could easily get to the entrance point.

It is highly recommended to visit this place. You can reach so close to the waterfall easily via the footpath. You can also have a bath at the built pool below the waterfall. You have to travel about 3km after turning from Elkaduwa Road. Vehicle parking is available at the entrance. You will have to buy entrance tickets.
