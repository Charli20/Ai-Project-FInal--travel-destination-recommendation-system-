There is a legend tied to its creation, and it gives the place a special character. The story says that during the time of King Dutugemunu, a local giant named Bulatha took on the huge task of building a dam. He was not described as an engineer in the tale. He was known as an elephant keeper. Yet the legend says he used strength, patience, and massive stones to shape the water into this lake. Whether you take it as history or folklore, the spirit of the story matches what you feel when you stand there. This is a land with deep roots and remarkable old-world skill. Beyond the story, Sorabora Wewa is simply a lovely place to slow down. The lake is surrounded by forest and open sky, and the air often feels cooler and cleaner than you expect. If you enjoy birdwatching in Sri Lanka, this is a rewarding spot. You may see water birds gliding low over the surface, and you will often hear birdsong all around the shore. The waters and nearby trees support many small creatures, reptiles, and fish. Every visit feels slightly different. Some mornings are bright and still. Some evenings bring misty light and soft wind across the lake. If you are lucky, you might even notice signs of elephants in the wider area. These moments are never guaranteed, and that is part of what makes the place feel real. For experiences, Sorabora Lake is easy to enjoy without rushing. A boat ride on Sorabora Lake is one of the nicest ways to take in the scenery. The views open out gently, and you can see the lake edge, the hills, and the forest line from a peaceful distance. It is quiet, simple, and memorable in the best way. If you prefer land-based time, the shoreline is ideal for slow photographs, relaxed chats, and calm reflection. For travellers who love the outdoors, camping at Sorabora Lake can be a beautiful option. Imagine a night under the stars with the sounds of nature close by. It works well for couples, friends, and families who want a peaceful break away from busy roads and crowded attractions. The key is to plan it properly, with the right spot, the right timing, and the right comfort level. Sorabora Lake is not loud. That is why I often describe it as one of Sri Lanka’s true hidden gems. It is a place for travellers who want to feel the country, not just tick off landmarks.","December 28, 2025"

There is a car park but it is a few hundred meters away from the tank, so you will have to walk a bit to get to the viewing area. It is wheelchair accessible if you don't mind getting a bit uncomfortable with the uneven surfaces leading up to the viewing platform. The ambiance is rather calming no matter the crowd. However, it will get quite busy during the hours when the sun is at its weakest. The viewing area is rather clean however the walk from the car park isn't, with quite a few health hazards going unnoticed. There isn't any staff present at the viewing area if that was something you needed to know. Also, there isn't anything to eat at the viewing area, though there may be non-permanent vendors around selling food and drinks.","February 21, 2025"

The early morning sunrise cruise was truly mesmerising. Watching the sun rise over the lake, with no one else around, was one of the best attractions in the region. The tranquillity and beauty of the lake made it feel as though we were completely alone in the world. A slow paddle around the lake’s edge gave us the chance to admire the local wildlife, including water monitor lizards, kingfishers, herons, hawks, and many bird species. On some days, you may even spot wild elephants coming to the lakeside for food and water. The cruise ended at a local fish market, which few tourists visit, and was followed by a delicious breakfast on a rocky outcrop by the lake, offering breathtaking views of the fishermen starting their day. This experience was organised by the team at Kevan’s Casa, and their attention to detail made it unforgettable. A must-do experience to add to your bucket list.","October 13, 2024"

It is thought to have been constructed during the reign of King Dutugemunu (161 BC – 137 BC) by a giant named Bulatha. In the ancient past, this tank was known as the 'Sea of Bintenna'. This rock cut deep canal acts as the sluice for the tank. Currently the tank and this ancient structure have been declared as archaeological protected monuments. The tank was built by damming the Diyawanna Oya with a 485-meter embankment. It does not make use of the structure called Bisokotuwa, which helps to regulate water pressure at the sluice gates from inside the tank and protect the embankment from erosion. Instead that the sluice gate (Sorowwa) of the tank has been placed strategically away from the embankment and made up utilizing the massive natural rock around the tank. It is said that this is the only such type sluice gate found in Sri Lanka. Boat riding, camping site, places to have a bath are main features in Sorabora tank for enjoying travelers.

Historical legend is, of the herculean task of a villager named Bulatha. He noticed a stream of water passing between two hill, realized that if could be dammed is an ideal location for a water reservoir. He started building the embankment across two hills by himself. Bulatha completed the reservoir with a 40 feet tall and 11 feet wide embankment which stretched to about 500 meters  with a unique sluice gate, through a solid natural rock. Since the rock was not subject to erosion by the pressure of water, it’s considered to be a unique innovation. The village donated to Bulatha by King Dutugemunu called Udathwewa is today known as Udaththawa and lies about 8 km north of Hasalaka town. There are ruins of a large reservoir at Udaththawa with a sluice gate built similar to Sorabora Wewa. Using the natural rock to build the sluice gate seems be unique to Bulatha and these two tanks are the only 2 known reservoirs in the ancient irrigation history of Sri Lanka to use this technology. Sorabora Wewa is a popular place among holiday makers. There are stalls selling sweets and freshly brewed steaming cups of local herb tea with plenty of other stalls which sell almost everything from toys to sun hats. Beautiful , tranquilizing place to spend an evening among birds and nature and enjoy a boat ride available.","September 15, 2019"

After driving about two kilometres along the Lake Road, we parked the car at the designated parking lot.  Parking fees Rs 80.00.  The path to the Sorabora Lake was clearly name posted.  All along the path were little shops selling trinkets, toys, foodstuffs and the like.  There were few kiosks too.  We reached the irrigation canal after a short walk of about 150 metres and walked up the steps towards the top of the embankment following the canal cut in solid rock.  On the lower stretches youngsters were frolicking in the water while the ladies and adults were enjoying a bath further downstream. A billboard on the way up provided information about the dam.  It had been constructed in the second century before Christ (bc).  The length of the dam is 1590 feet and supplies irrigation water to 2000 acres (800 ha).  It had been renovated in recent times by Irrigation Department. At the top of the steps was the unique sluice gate that I came here to see.  In most ancient and modern dams, the sluice/s to carry water downstream is/are located along the embankment of the dam.  Not so here at Sorabora Lake!  The sluice the left end of the embankment had been cut into solid granite rock.  The first 30 metres or so of the canal after the sluice runs in solid rock cut to shape in ancient times.  Thus water released through this sluice flowing under pressure along the canal does not erode its rocky banks.  Conversely, the downstream of a sluice through an embankment, may it be ancient or modern, needs to be protected against extreme soil erosion using pressure balancing chambers or concrete lining to counter the effects of erosion from fast flowing waters. I walked along the 1590 metre long bund to the right end of the dam where I observed the spillway and another irrigation canal.  There is a cute swing bridge too. The spillway, that operates when the dam is at full capacity, is cut into rock preventing erosion of its banks.  There is an irrigation canal at the right end of the dam too.  This had been constructed recently.  Visitors can enjoy a ride in the reservoir in one of the boats. There are fishing boats as well as individual fishermen fishing at the bottom of the embankment. It took me about two hours to explore the beauty and effectiveness of this ancient engineering meeting marvel.","August 14, 2019"
