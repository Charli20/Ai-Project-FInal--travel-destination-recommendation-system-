This was my third visit, and every time I come here, the experience feels new, peaceful, and deeply spiritual. The moment you step inside the kovil, you can feel the calmness. The sea breeze, the ancient architecture, and the powerful energy of the place make your mind completely relaxed. The view from the top is truly breathtaking — the blue ocean stretching far beyond your eyes. It feels like nature itself is giving you a blessing. The temple premises are well maintained and very clean. Watching people pray with devotion, hearing the bells, and standing in front of Lord Shiva’s sanctum gives a beautiful sense of peace. Every visit makes me feel more connected to my faith and culture. If you are visiting Trincomalee, Thirukoneswaram Kovil is a must-visit, not just for religious reasons but also for the history, beauty, and the peaceful atmosphere it offers. I know this won’t be my last visit — this temple always pulls me back with its divine charm.","December 10, 2025"

Hard to ignore. A stop in the park with the deer that let themselves be approached, then a few meters to the sea, entered Fort Frederick and you find yourself at the foot of a great climb that the tuk tuk climbs in 1st. Once in the parking lot, in the midst of the deer and peacocks, you cross an alley lined with shops and the temple is there, just upstairs.You have to put on your shoes (on a hot temple, provide socks so as not to burn your feet while walking). No admission fee, you make a free donation when you get your shoes back. The temple had an important destiny during the 1st millennium AD. Dating back to BC, successive kings gave it scope and fame. At the beginning of the 17th century, fearing a Portuguese invasion, the religious and notables of Trincomalee threw into the sea, just below the cliff on which the temple is erected, the important pieces to escape the invader. They were attacked: in 1623, the Portuguese took the city and razed the temple. It was not until 1950 that divers (including science fiction writer Arthur Clarke) rediscovered these submerged remains. The coins are reassembled and used to reconstruct the current temple, associated with more recent elements. Some of the pieces have remained underwater, just above the cliff, and are an extraordinary diving spot. Koneswaram means ""where Shiva is"". A grand Shiva status is at the entrance to the temple. The interior consists of mystical scenes and religious effigies. Just at the entrance to the cliffside path, a tree collects wooden crates that the faithful hang on its branches. These are symbolized cradles, with the tree receiving prayers related to fertility requests.","July 27, 2025"

Its location is idyllic and the tuk tuk will ignore the no vehicle signs beyond this point and take you to where you need to hand in your sandals before entry. An array of stalls line both sides of the dirt road to the actual steps. As usual the stalls are all selling the same souvenirs and confectionery. Upon entering, you are overwhelmed with a huge statue of the Hindu Lord Shiva. This one is pink, it baffles me how many different interpretations there are of Shiva? Anyway to the left of him nestled beneath a tree are several deer. They graze on the grass and birds are also amongst them squawking happily. The usual traditional temple surroundings are here. After two weeks in Sri Lanka, it’s all too familiar and nothing more than decoration over slabs of concrete. Elaborate in parts whist needing some tlc in other parts. The incense burns, the chanting is soft and tourists are both fascinated and more than happy to emulate the rituals of locals. For me personally I was more impressed with its location. At the edge of a steep mountain rock offering panoramic views of a beach and the sea. You could hear waves gently crash and take in the fresh air. It’s a popular destination if you’re spiritual or take it with a pinch of salt. Either way, it’s well worth a visit for the scenery alone. It’s also free entry, which makes you wonder why in other temples they charge an extortionate rate entrance fees.","January 16, 2025"

The most sacred of the Pancha Ishwarams of Sri Lanka, it was built significantly during the ancient period on top of Konesar Malai, a promontory overlooking Trincomalee District, Gokarna Bay and the Indian Ocean. The monument contains its main shrine to Shiva in the form Kona-Ishvara, shortened to Konesar. The complex was destroyed in colonial religious attacks between 1622 and 1624 and a fort was built at the site from its debris. A 1632-built temple located away from the city houses some of its original idols. Worldwide interest was renewed following the discovery of its underwater and land ruins, sculptures and Chola bronzes by archaeologists and Arthur C. Clarke. It has been preserved through restorations, most recently in the 1950s. Granted ownership of villages in its floruit to form the Trincomalee District, Trincomalee village is located on the cape isthmus within the compounds. Revenue from the temple provides services and food to residents. Koneswaram has many strong historical associations. The shrine is described in the Vayu Purana, the Konesar Kalvettu and Tevaram hymns by Sambandhar and Sundarar as a Paadal Petra Sthalam along with its west coast Ishwaram counterpart Ketheeswaram temple, Mannar, and was praised for its tradition by Arunagirinathar upon his visit. The Dakshina Kailasa Puranam and Manmiam works note it as Dakshina/Then Kailasam (Mount Kailash of the South) for its longitudinal position and pre-eminence, it lies directly east of Kudiramalai west coast Hindu port town, while it is the easternmost shrine of the five ancient Ishwarams of Shiva on the island. This religious temple is well-preserved for all devotees and we have a lot of respect and believe in Lord Shiva as Sri Lankans. As Sri Lankans, we pay to visit the said temple and pay our utmost humble respect and worship Lord Shiva whenever we visit Trico or pass by this lovely town at any given time. People from all over the world visit this temple. It was an amazing feeling to visit back the said temple grounds with my family during our visit to Trinco again. We will always retain the said temple since we are so blessed to have the said temple in such holly /religious grounds of Trinco the history left behind and around the old port of Trinco which is one of the most amazing natural harbours of the world the said temple is amazing to watch to any visitors around the world.","September 26, 2024"

It’s know as Lovers Leap. The local people are also very friendly and welcoming but just be warned about the few people mainly ladies that will try and con you outside the temple at the end of the road.

It is a safe haven for the here as they are quite safe and are protected. At the end of the path beyond a few steps is the statue of God Siva seated in lotus position, with its vehicle, the bull name Nandi.  This is a grand structure and stands out majestically as you approach the temple.  We came to the entrance to the main temple after passing this Siva statue.  Though we went inside to look at the grand sculptures and paintings, photographs were forbidden. A little beyond the temple entrance the view outside into the sea is beautiful, with many fishing boats.  The sheer drop at one of these places is called the “lover’s leap” where a distraught lady flung herself to the watery grave after watching her lover, a member of the Dutch foreign service, sailing away back to Holland. What struck me most were the little colourful baskets, said to be small versions of baby cots, hanging on one of the trees towards the sea side under flags of various colours.

The reunion with relatives in Jaffna took us to four of the Siva Temples in Sri Lanka during the first seven days of our Sri Lanka Odyssey. Our first stop, on March 3rd, was at the Munneswaram temple situated in a village in the Puttalam District. Hindus believe that it is one of the the five temples they need to visit in their life time. The others being Naguleswaram temple which we visited in Keerimalai in the Kankesanthurai district on March 4th and Thiruketheeshwaram in Mannar District and the Koneswaram temple in Trincomalee (Thirukonamalai) -- both the next day. All these, including Rameswaram in India form the five ancient temples (Ishwarams) dedicated to Shiva. According to Hindus, the Munneswaram temple near Puttalam is the temple where King Rama prayed to Shiva after killing Ravana to seek forgiveness over the death of many in the war. Hindus believe that the Naguleswaram temple's adjacent water tank, the Keerimalai Springs, has curative properties. The temple was largely destroyed by Jesuit missionaries following the Portuguese conquest of the Jaffna kingdom, restored by Arumuga Navallar in 1894. The Thiruketheeshwaram temple had existed for more than 2,400 years. During our visit to this temple, we witnessed a temple devotee from Vavunia singing Thevarams. His aim was to complete the 800 thurmurai thevarams in one month. The Trincomelee Koneswaram temple was built by the Cholas/Pandian kings. The temple is situated atop Konesar Malai, at a commanding position overlooking the Indian Ocean. It is also known as the ""Mount Kailash of the South"". The temple, mentioned in Mahabaratha and Ramayana, was visited by Arunagirinathar and is the easternmost shrine of the five ancient Ishwarams of Shiva on the island.","March 22, 2018"

During the 17th Century AD ( around 1630 s) the temple was supposed to have been razed to the ground by foreign invaders to build a harbour. The local priests hurriedly burred the important idols of the Gods before leaving the temple , fearing vandalism. And in 1956, in an underwater exploration , the old temple ruins were found, Besides a lot of inscriptions about the temple etc were also discovered . All the bits and pieces dicovered were put together and now a grand temple is there once again for us to worship. A great work of reconstruction of the temple as well as the history. The temple is sung about gloriously by the great poet saints. Sambandhar and Arunagirinathar. the Pandya Chola and Chera kings of south India  were said to have patronized and visited the temple.The Vilva tree is the Sacred tree of this temple.

From the parking lot there is a 10-minute–walk up to the Temple. Among the several foreign visitors we met German, Spanish, Italian, Scottish and Chinese tourists. That shows the popularity of this place. Laxmi’s long-term wish got fulfilled this evening after we were blessed with a very happy and blissful Divine Sight of Śrī Śānkarī Dévi and Her Lord Śrī Śiva in this only Śakti Peeţhaṃ in Sri Lanka – known locally as Konéśwara Ālayaṃ – Śrī Mahā Śakti Peeţhaṃ Temple - of the eighteen (the remaining seventeen being located in India) at this MOST SACRED PLACE in Trincomalee. The surrounding views are full of greenery and so beautiful. The blue Indian Ocean appearing on both sides of the Temple Complex presented a lovely spectacle! The Scottish couple took me to be a Guide and said they were not going to pay me anything when I volunteered to explain the story of Śrī Mārkaṇḑéya in the complex. However, they were very happy to listen to the Purāṇic legend narrated by me - about Sage Mārkaṇḑéya as even the God of Death Yama had to take off his crown and mace and surrender totally before Lord Siva when commanded by Siva to spare the life of His devotee Mārkaṇḑéya!  They profusely thanked me after hearing my narration and felt so happy knowing that I was a student at the Imperial College, London, long time ago but  that I was not a Guide! The Scotsman respectfully took off his hat and bowed before Lord Śiva in reverence. It was learnt that the Portuguese who were in occupation of Sri Lanka in the 16 Century AD destroyed the original Temple and threw all the magnificent sculptured stone columns down into the sea below. Three bronze statues were lately brought up by divers, found among the columns buried in the sea, one of which has been mounted atop the hill facing the entrance to the renovated Temple. The Temple opened at 5 O’Clock in the evening. The Tamil priests first performed the prescribed customary rituals to the Lord. We have then made our own humble offerings to the Presiding Deity Śrī Śānkarī Dévi. We had the Most Divine Sight and blessings of the Holy Lord and His Divine Consort while witnessing in awe all the Pūja Worships done by the Tamil priests in the huge, peaceful and Serene complex.","November 10, 2017"

On that way, near the temple, there is wash room facilities available. You can use by paying a small money for the guy there. But, it was not very clean. If you are going by your own vehicle, I advise NOT to go near the top by the vehicle. You will get stuck at the top and even you found a place to park, it would be unsafe as the parking would be mainly by a narrow road. This happens specially on holidays.

The garish colours, the endless figures in strange mutations and poses... it is like a fever-dream and so hard to take in. The flames, prayer cloths and model cribs along with the chants, half naked priests and bells all add to the sense of other worldliness. I'm no closer to understanding Hinduism but I am intrigued and my children were fascinated by it all. Culturally important but difficult to access spiritually or educationally. A stunning place though and you must visit.","August 11, 2016"

It's an uphill path so a tuk tuk might help those with mobility issues, but it's not that hard to get to. You leave your shoes at the entrance and pay 20 rupees to get them back when you leave. I didn't heed the previous reviews and went barefooted and it is really hot on the soles of your feet, so be warned! The temple itself is beautiful - lots of colourful deities and carvings - when we got there, offerings were starting and so a lot of things were being covered up. this didn't detract from the experience overall, but just know that this sometimes happens. There's also an outdoor bit around the edge of the cliff - you can look out over the Bay of Bengal and hope to spot a whale. All in all, a lovely temple to visit - there's not much to do in Trinco, so definitely give this a shot!","August 4, 2016"

Caution - the walk from the place you remove the footwear to the covered portion of the temple can be cruel on sensitive feet ! We reached at noon - and we really felt the heat.
