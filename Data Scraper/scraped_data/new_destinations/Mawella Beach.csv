This is a long beach that is pretty much only used by local fishermen.  Not built up at all and we maybe saw two other tourist couples during our 5 day stay.  The beach is clean and a sand bottom.  The waves were great for our kids and all three older ones played in them.  We were able to surf and ride some waves as well.  This beach is a prime example of the beauty of the far south of Sri Lanka as it is very local (in a good way) and unspoiled.  For reference, we visited in March and sea condition was very good for swimming.  Great place for a sunrise.","April 3, 2018"

Reasonably priced, with a few cosy bungalows, a pool and some sunbeds at guests' disposal. Very friendly and helpful staff, that can arrange anything you need. And what's most important, kilometres of calm, quiet, almost empty, wide and clean beach. A couple of small local restaurants (including one in the resort) are there for a nice Sri-Lankan lunch and dinner - there is always something to choose from.","February 23, 2018"

Very limited sunbeds.. by beach shacks or dragged onto beach from accommodation.. Advertised as safe swimming, but be careful as undertow strong on occasions  and our hotel had a guide as to 'what to do in a riptide!'. A few small hotels have gardens right onto the beach. A couple of good beach shacks selling excellent fish (you can place your order earlier in day and discuss how you want fish cooked... so we got more fish in our curry than traditional Sri Lankan dishes). Take a torch for evening meal. Some of the hotels did not welcome' outside guests' in for meals or refreshments. Slight issue with dogs, but they bark at everyone  (not as suggested by jogger below!) and their fighting amongst themselves was a bit ferocious at times. Other than that, just a few  birds, monkeys, fishermen and the occasional stray tourist to keep you company.","February 14, 2017"

This is a very beautiful beach. We stayed at villa Mawella for 9 nights and strolled along the beach 3 times a day. the local fishing boats are dotted along the shore, the sand is nice and firm to walk along, the Indian ocean is ridiculously beautiful and warm. You may see 10 people in total as you walk along the beach and half of those will be locals fixing their nets and tending to their boats.

It is small, private and not touristy at all. I  attempted a morning jog along the beach however a small group of dogs, which I  never saw again, seemed upset at a white person running and they were persistent. Each day the fisherman wanted a hand bringing their boats in and you are rewarded with a few of their catches which was lovely. On our last night we gave our cook the night off and they recommended we go to Mawella Beach Resort for dinner,  this was a huge mistake,  no one was staying at the restaurant and we were the only people eating there so the options were chicken or fish for dinner. The meals took 1 & 1/2 hours to arrive and one of the pieces of chicken was raw (we were not charged for this). The  large mixed salad was simply an oval plate piled with sliced cucumber, a few slices of tomato,  a handful of grated carrot and cabbage in the middle, and it was more than twice the price of the main meals. We were very disappointed in our meals there. Mawella Beach is wonderful but I wouldn't recommend eating at Mawella Beach Resort restaurant.","August 11, 2015"

The owner of the place very helpful and the staff were friendly. They got small pool and beach is out of season to swim but we had great fun with playing in waves.

Not any tourists still, so you can relax in peace and quiet and enjoy the sea, the sand and the atmosphere.  We stayed in the Mawella beach resort for 1 night whilst waiting to go to our chosen guest house due to arriving earlier than planned and were initially pleased with price, location and the little garden chalets.  This all changed with the absolutely frightful staff!!  One young waiter was lovely...the three other men around the restaurand and lobby area were another matter completely. One was patrolling the garden with a big stick, looking for dogs...he seemed amazed that we were angry at his  behaviour towards animals (thought Buddhists were opposed to cruelty???), the other two seemed eager to get rid of us ASAP, turned the lights off and hovered around looking at their watches...at 10pm and whilst we were having our after dinner drinks.
