The sensible logic is that it gets hot during the day and the damp air rising up at the lookout points condenses in to cloud by late morning and kills the view which you are there for, plus rain can come in the afternoons.  We have teenage children, so 5am was never going to happen.  We started walking at 10am.  The day was part sunny and with a slight breeze and we made it to Little Worlds End with a great view.  The Worlds End view, was cloudy when we got there, but within seconds had entirely cleared for pictures, and then gone again within another minute.  Lots of wildlife along the way, Monkeys hooting and displaying in the trees, coloured lizards / chameleons all over the place, lots of pretty birds and flowers.  Best to go clockwise so you reach the lookout places as early as you can, ref the cloud issue, and then take a leisurely walk down and around the valley and the stream, meanders and waterfalls along the way.  Worth a quick look at the basic museum near the ticket office, to understand the context of how the place has changed over the centuries, deforestation, elephant killing, the impact of invasive species (who would have through Trout could be a pest?), and even potato farming as recently as the 60s, before it was made in to a reserve.  Not cheap to enter the park, but worth it to keep and preserve the area.","August 9, 2018"

What is involved, is a 14 km walk, mostly through rough trails on rocks, mud, and river beds.  I can't imagine what it would be like if the conditions were rainy or any more wet/ slippery!  I would not recommend it for young families or anyone that does not have appropriate footwear.  I did like some of the sites but spent most of the time watching my footing.  We were disappointed not to see any fauna, beyond the deer at the entrance.","December 2, 2015"
