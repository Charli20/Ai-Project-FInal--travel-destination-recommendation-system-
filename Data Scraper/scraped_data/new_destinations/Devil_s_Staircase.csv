We took an early train to Ohiya and walked up the quiet road from the station to the trailhead.  Devil’s Staircase initially shares its path with stage 11 of the Pekoe Trail (orange markers) but then turns right across a stream to continue its descent.  Bambarakanda waterfall becomes visible towards the end of the trail, where there are several small cafés.  It is then a further 5km to the main road at Kalupahana, where it is easy to catch a bus.","January 26, 2025"

Mr. Eomal Perera, the owner is a kind gentleman who has a wealth of knowledge about the area. Take a 1L water bottle, snacks, a cap, shades, sunblock, a hiking staff (if you have one), wear good walking shoes, umbrella/ raincoat. If you take a short cut from Hill Safari through the villages and down foot paths among the vegetable gardens, the walk will take 4hrs max. If you walk along the main road above Hill Safari passing the 2 silent factories (Ohiya & Udaveriya) it will take about 5+ hrs. Start the walk early, even 6am when the sun is coming up. The scenery is spectacular. Take time to talk to the locals, they are friendly & like to interact with hikers. We took the kids some socks which was much appreciated. If you can, take them something small like pens, socks, Tamil Story books etc. They ask for sweets or biscuits! Two dogs befriended us separately & led us through many foot paths, which was very entertaining! They just want some food if you have any. You need a 4WD or a bike to travel on this road. But personally, I prefer to walk. There is a safari jeep which takes tourists on this road for Rs. 10,000 for 6 pax.

Some Tips: If you chose to travel on foot, make sure you keep yourself hydrated and energized. You can take shortcuts to reduce the length of the journey. The downside here is that their slopes are steeper and you might miss some good sceneries. Travel light and don't eat heavy food before or during the journey.","May 16, 2017"

We were accompanied by a trekker from an outbound travel company, but on hind sight he was not required. We started the walk at 7am, but should have started at 6am as it got quite hot and sunny towards 10am. The walk started from Hill Safari Eco Lodge, Ohiya and ended close to Bambarakanda Falls in Kalupahana. The scenery along the walk was breathtaking. We walked through tea gardens, vegetable home gardens, through remote villages, past silent tea factories, green grass, blue mountains in a distance, small streams culminating in a shallow pool etc. Take drinking water and a few snacks. The walk took about 4-5 hrs with many stops to admire the views. If possible, try to walk up to the top of Bambarakanda Falls. It could be slippery with the pine needles coating the forest ground...but maybe worth a try. We didnt, because it could be risky and the possible leeches!","September 15, 2014"
