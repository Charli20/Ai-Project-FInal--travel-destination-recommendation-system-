We spent 3 hours walking around the site. Plenty of shade, but if you can try and get there by 9am We liked, in particular the museum, the orchid house and the three avenues of pine, coconut and palm trees. The royal circle was interesting, checking out the many trees planted by dignitaries and royalty over the years. The herbal garden was disappointing and needs upgrading and the two cafes not great either. However we spent a good few hours checking out some amazing trees and flora and learning about the history of the gardens","January 20, 2026"

We only had time to explore a small portion, perhaps two or three acres, but were captivated by its beauty. The gardens are world-renowned for their extensive collection of over 4,000 plant species, including a magnificent orchid house, spices, medicinal plants, and imposing palm avenues. A unique feature is the tradition of visiting dignitaries planting memorial trees; one notable example is the Ceylon ironwood tree planted by Tsar Nicholas II of Russia during his visit in 1891.","November 4, 2025"

The gardens are huge and beautifully maintained, with over 4,000 plant species from around the world. My favourites were the colourful Orchid House, the impressive avenue of Royal Palms, and the massive Javan fig tree which is truly a wonder to see. It’s a very calm and relaxing place, with plenty of benches to sit and take in the scenery. You can easily spend 2–3 hours wandering here. Tip: Visit in the morning or late afternoon for softer light and fewer crowds.

This was followed by King Kirti Sri and King Rajadhi Rajasinghe. A temple was built on this location by King Wimala Dharma, but it was destroyed by the British when they were given control over the Kingdom of Kandy.[citation needed] Thereafter, the groundwork for a botanical garden was formed by Alexandar Moon in 1821. He used the garden for coffee and cinnamon plants.[4] The Botanical Garden at Peradeniya was formally established in 1843 with plants brought from Kew Garden, Slave Island, Colombo, and the Kalutara Garden in Kalutara. The Royal Botanic Garden, Peradeniya was made more independent and expanded under George Gardner as superintendent in 1844. On Gardner's death in 1849 George Henry Kendrick Thwaites became superintendent. He served until he resigned in 1879, when he was succeeded by Henry Trimen, who served until 1895.[5][6] He was succeeded in turn by John Christopher Willis who served as director from 1898 until 1912. The garden came under the administration of the Department of Agriculture when it was established in 1912. There are avenues in the River Drive such as Cook's Pine Avenue, Palmyra Palm Avenue, Double Coconut Avenue, Cabbage Palm Avenue, and Royal Palm Avenue.[7] The classical Avenue of Palms is in this Garden. One item with a significant history is the Cannonball Tree planted by King George V of the United Kingdom and Queen Mary in 1901. It is often load with fruit, which are thought to resemble cannonballs. During World War II, the Botanic Garden was used by Lord Louis Mountbatten, the supreme commander of the allied forces in the South Asia, as the headquarters of the South East Asia Command. The gardens were used as a location in the 1957 film The Bridge on the River Kwai. The origins of the botanical garden date back to 1371, when King Wickramabahu III ascended the throne and held court in Peradeniya near the Mahaweli River. He was succeeded by King Kirti Sri and King Rajadhi Rajasinghe. King Wimala Dharma built a temple on this site, but it was destroyed by the British when they gained control of the kingdom of Kandy.

Along River Drive, there are avenues such as Cook's Pine Avenue, Palmyra Palm Avenue, Double Coconut Avenue, Cabbage Palm Avenue, and Royal Palm Avenue.[7] This garden is also home to the classic Palm Avenue.  One object with significant history is the cannonball tree planted in 1901 by King George V of the United Kingdom and Queen Mary. It is often loaded with fruits thought to resemble cannonballs.

The gardens are vast, beautifully maintained, and offer a perfect blend of natural beauty and tranquility. Walking through the towering palm avenues, orchid house, and spice gardens was a relaxing and enriching experience. The sheer variety of flora was impressive, and the kids especially enjoyed the giant bamboo and the massive Javan fig tree. The weather in April was warm but pleasant, and there were plenty of shaded areas to rest. We packed some snacks and had a lovely little picnic on the grass. It’s also a great spot for photography—every corner has something unique to offer. Highly recommend this place for families, nature lovers, or anyone looking to spend a peaceful day outdoors. Give yourself at least 2–3 hours to explore fully. Tip: Wear comfortable shoes, bring water, and try to visit early in the morning or late afternoon to avoid the midday heat.","June 12, 2025"

The garden is home to more than 4000 species of plants, spices, medicinal plants and palm trees. You can explore the grounds on foot, however, if you’re feeling tired, or potentially lazy, golf carts can be rented. It costs 1500 LKR/person to enter the gardens. A perfect place to relax and take some great pictures, we spent about 2 hours here and went early in the morning to avoid crowds of people.","April 11, 2019"

There are less flowers in the gardens than I expected and the gardens are dominated by large trees, with some particularly impressive specimens. There are also large collections of Bamboo and palms. There is also a reasonably nice orchid house. I think I was most impressed by the large number of flying foxes (bats) that roost in the trees in the corner near the suspension bridge. There are thousands, and the information board says 24k which I can believe. They make quite a racket, and you do see quite a number flying around which is impressive as they are huge. One minor critism is that there were too few benches, and those that were available were always occupied by courting couples, it seems to be where they come. Overall a great place to spend a few hours, although not in the same league as other  botantical gardens such as the one in Singapore which is a lot bigger with a vastly superior collection of orchids.","April 6, 2019"

Just a few things our guide helped with. Always enter and leave via the suspension bridge entrance as it is much quieter, watch out for the monkeys, they will steal anything if you give them an opportunity and take plenty of water. There are places to buy stuff but not a great deal of variety? Worth a visit.","February 26, 2019"

Lots of different garden houses to visit plus a couple of impressive avenues of palm trees, a picturesque lake and plenty of places to sit and watch the world go by. We also saw a whole lot of bats in some strange leaning trees, I’ve no idea why they were leaning so dramatically. If you need refreshments there’s couple of cafes for a drink.

I've certainly seen better collections of specific types of plants, but the overall collection on display here, and the overall feel of the place was special. One minor criticism - I would have loved to see an orchid display 10 times the size of what they currently have (think Singapore's garden). You know they grow here, let's show them off!
