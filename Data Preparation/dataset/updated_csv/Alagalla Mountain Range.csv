Definitely Not advisable for climbing SOLO as there are few tricky spots up top where it's better to have some assist.Besides the mountain is located way off houses of people so in the event of a slight injury you might need to walk down well over 2km for help. But if a team of two or more could take on the challenge which is not too risky much of the way. Two possible trail heads- one from the village of Poththapitiya [better for mixed teams] and the other from near the Ihalakotte railway station. Ascent is moderate from Potthapitiya with only the very last part of the climb being tricky through boulders[be watchful there, since even an injury of a small level could make things difficult due to medical help being way below and far.] The other end of the summit has a sharp 40ft precipice which experienced climber could scale down with the help of a rope .Climb down is possible to either trail head. leach activity is likely during the wet months. Water sources not available close to the summit so the campers need to bring supplies up. Views are breathtaking but be extremely careful if camping is done at the summit[ not advisable] Do not venture too far off since the sheer precipice is just feet away. Rains and heavy wind could make things very challenging at the summit and its best to avoid climbing during the rainy months. Trail is clean. BRING BACK ALL YOU TAKE UP THERE. PLEASE BRING THINGS LEFT BY IRRESPONSIBLE PEOPLE if you find any.","December 24, 2023"

At one point (behind the last tea plantation at the Natural Reservate sign) we took a wrong turn. Here you have to take the path on the right. The trails are a bit overgrown. The way up took 2 hours and the way down 1 hour. The view at the top was amazing. If you want to go to the summit of the mountain, you have to climb a bit. This is not for everyone, but you will have a nice view regardless.","January 8, 2022"

You can easily take the train and get down at the Ihala Kotte train station and start the hike. If you are a beginner, this might not be the easiest one. Going on to the top of the rock is a bit risky as you need to use a rope (which is already there) but is it worth it. There is more about this on my instagram @chamalthecamel","August 19, 2019"

Poththapitiya is a sleepy little town and whatever the food you may need for the climb could be bought there. The road to the mountain begins from the town itself and the time it may take would be around 2 hours at leisure. Path is good enough with first part of it being through the village .Ascent begins later ,first through the little forest and later among the mana grass as the climb gets steep. There is a section with a collection of boulders right before the summit and care is needed when negotiating through them up on to the summit. Behold the vista which is virtually 360 degrees with literally a third of Srilanka in the eye. Alagalle rarely covers itself in mist so the view is a near guarantee.You have two options for the climb down .Amore adventurous one would be the decent to the rail track near Ihala Kotte station,for which a guide and a rope would be needed as the left side of the somewhat steep rock at the summit requires a rope to help yourself down it. Or you could negotiate your way back along the same route used for ascent. Risk level is mostly moderate and leech protection is a need. Public transport is available from Poththapitiya to Kandy until night fall.","August 8, 2019"

I took what I believe if the easy way up: a road to the right of the Alagalla Tea Factory turns into a track which turns into a path. It was easy to follow all the way to the top. First the route passes among scattered homes that just about constitute a village, then it winds up through tea plantations to a short stretch of forest and then grassland. The top takes a bit of scrambling up some rocks, but there is a rope to help. If you’re reasonably fit and conditions are good, it shouldn’t take much more than an hour and a half all the way by this route. Take care on the way down to avoid slipping.","December 29, 2018"

Strongly advice not to hike during rainy season because the trekking path is damn slippery when it rains. Be sure to carry some meds to prevent from leach bites.

I've done this mountain twice one from the Beaten path via Pilimathalawa->Pottapitiya in Kandy and the other via the Ihalakotte railway station on the Colombo-Kandy main line. The Pottapitiya is a beaten path and is quite easy and you do not have to be crazy fit to do this. But the view at the top is really awesome. A night on the top is lovely if you want to see a sunset or sunrise, but be aware of wild boar, they are really dangerous and they are all over in the night. The other route from Ihalakotte railway station has a kind of path, but our group decided to take an off road route and it is crazy. With climbing just hanging by two fingers, to scaling crumbling rock to the use of anchored ropes, and orienteering through lush green patches of forests. But for this you must be fit and very brave. When you reach the top there is a rock, which the mountain is named after ""alagalla"" or ""the yam rock"". There is only one direction you can get on top of that, and if you try the other direction be aware if you slip there is a 40m drop, like we nearly found out the hard way. You will also need to carry all your rations and water. There are some water spouts but don't rely on them. Also don't try this solo cause this is not a frequented mountain. Also try it during the dry season cause rain makes the trek very risky and slippery.","September 12, 2015"

I really didn't think this leisurely hike would end up being a very strenuous and adventurous climb of a mountain that was over 1100m high. This is how the terrain went  - 1. Tea plantation 2. Mossy and wet forest patch 3. Shrubland 4. Rock The tea plantation area had clear-cut pathways but from there on, there was hardly any path/route. We heard that our host Rotaractors were just taking us on the more difficult terrain rather than the easier route (just to bully us a bit), so I have no idea if there would be an easier way up there. Once you get to the mossy, wet forest patch, expect heaps of leeches! I wasn't prepared for a rough climb so was just wearing sandals (BIG MISTAKE!). Once you survive leech territory, be prepared for the itchy and thorny shrubs! We were totally unequipped, so by the time we got to this section of the climb, we had run out of water AND energy! That's when we saw the last phase of our trek - literally a massive rock which you needed to climb to get to the peak. There was no pathway, so we had to just hold on to the edges of the rocks and creep through crevices to get to the top. This is a very steep ascend so one needs to be extra careful, especially if the wind conditions aren't favourable. Traveling with friends would help to support one another during this bit. However, once you get to the top, you forget all the hardships you went through to get to your final destination. The view is so breathtaking that you forget the blood dripping down your legs thanks to the leech bites. You will not only be able to have a complete view of Mawanella from here, but also Rambukkana, Hataraliyadda, Pothapitiya, Kandy – Colombo Main Road etc. No words can explain this view, so if you're adventurous enough - you should definitely consider seeing this for yourself :) TIPS: - Take some leech protection with you - Make sure you're well prepared with sunblock lotion, water, snacks and proper hiking clothes and gear (rope etc if assistance is needed) - Be prepared for changes in wind conditions - You can either camp overnight or even do a day trip (2/3 hours one way but this depends on the individual) - The most important thing you'll need is an adventurous, thrill seeking spirit :)","June 29, 2015"
