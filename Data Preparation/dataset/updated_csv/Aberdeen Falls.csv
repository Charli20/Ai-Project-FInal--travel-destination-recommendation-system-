About 20 mts from Norton Bridge. Although distance is about 4km, the narrow and sometimes broken road makes driving slow. A normal car can go without any problems though. There is a carpark just opposite the staircase on the right that goes all the way to the falls. Pretty long way but my kids of 9 and 11 made it without any fuss. Coming back is a different story! The falls had the right amount of water when we went. It was a beauty. We can walk on the shallow sand strip right near to the falls. On either side of the sand strip it looks deep. Sand seems rather solid in the middle so we and few others walked up to the falls. There was a coffee shop halfway down the stairs, owned by a foreign couple. It was pretty good and decently priced. We had refreshments there. Rarely do we get to visit a falls where the kids could enjoy right underneath. This was beautiful!","April 21, 2021"

This waterfall, 98 metres tall, is ranked the 18th highest in Sri Lanka. The falls are at Ginigathhena on Kehelgamu Oya, a major tributary of Kelani River. After parking our vehicle in a private yard, we walked about 1200 metres on a 3 foot (0.9m) wide built-up path to reach the falls. There are between 600 to 700 steps along the way.  It was a pleasant walk amongst the tall trees and brush. The Observation platform at the end of the path provides a magnificent view of the fall.  The waters drop into a large pool where we saw some enjoying a swim.  The pool is surrounded by rocks. I noted that some visitors to the falls had left behind their waste at the observation platform.  This is unfortunate and displays their cussed nature in failing to protect such a pristine environment.  Kudos to the volunteers from the village who collected these for disposal. On our return, we sat on log-seats at our parking lot and had some soda to recover our breadth.  Clean toilet facilities available in the adjoining house (Rs 20 pp) were most welcome! At my age of 78, I did not find the descent and the return ascent easy.  However, looking back, it was well worth the effort!  Visitors to note: It would be quite slippery after rains when wet.","April 3, 2021"

Take the Sripada turn from 43rd km post after passing Kithulgala. There is another road to reach Aberdeen falls just before Ginigathhena but reaching down the waterfall is suppored to be bit hard from that end. We actually came to visit this while staying in Hatton so we came via Norton bridge. We went to the bottom of the fall by climbing down 500m. There were cement steps and journey down and up was not had as Laxapana falls. We went during the dry season and there was no leaches.  Here there is a viepoint but who ever wants to get in to the water can go further down. But swimming in the two deep areas in eitherside is bit riskey according to the villagers. There is a shollow sand stip in the middle so we got only in to that area.,"March 2, 2021"

Remember to take a sturdy pair of shoes and your swimming trunks as it’s quite tricky avoiding obstacles and roots on the way down. The pool was almost empty when we went as most people stop at the viewpoint and do go down to the pool. As you reach the viewpoint you will make your way over some large rocks  that can be a little slippery so be aware . Once you’ve conquered the thousands of steps, trip hazards and slippery rocks you’ll have a wonderful time swimming under the waterfall, don’t be intimidated by its height, the waterfall just hits you like a rain shower.
