As a tour guide, I’m continually amazed by the sanctuary’s diverse avian life and the serene beauty of its wetland landscapes. The sanctuary’s unique blend of lagoons, marshes, and lush vegetation creates a picturesque setting that is perfect for birdwatching. One of the highlights of guiding here is the opportunity to introduce visitors to the incredible array of bird species that call Anawilundawa home. From the striking colors of the kingfishers to the graceful herons and the vibrant migrant species, each visit reveals new wonders. One of the most fulfilling aspects of guiding at Anawilundawa is sharing the rich ecological and cultural significance of the sanctuary. The park’s wetlands are crucial for maintaining biodiversity and supporting various species, and explaining this to visitors adds depth to their experience. I enjoy discussing the importance of wetland conservation and the ongoing efforts to protect these vital habitats. The peaceful and less commercialized atmosphere of Anawilundawa offers a refreshing contrast to more crowded tourist spots. Visitors often appreciate the tranquility and the chance to connect with nature in a more intimate setting. Whether it’s a leisurely stroll through the sanctuary or a quiet moment observing birds, the experience here is deeply immersive and calming. For those interested in birdwatching or simply enjoying the beauty of Sri Lanka’s natural landscapes, Anawilundawa Bird Sanctuary is a must-visit destination. Its rich biodiversity, scenic beauty, and the opportunity to learn about conservation make it an exceptional place to explore. Join us on a tour and discover the enchanting world of Anawilundawa for yourself.","August 10, 2024"

However this Ramsar wetland is a must see area if you are a bird enthusiast. Roads are lined by trees and water in the area make this place a bird paradise. I wanted to see the rare black naped oriole but was not lucky enough but we were able to see other birds. There were fishermen fishing in the tank and they advised us to come in March becuase when water levels go down more birds come to the area. There was a small boutique where we were able to buy ginger tea and rolls. Just waiting there seated and waching the nature was very soothing. We stayed little far from the santuary. Early mornings are the best time to enjoy the bird songs and watch them,"February 9, 2023"

Our guide suggested the day before that we should walk around the sanctuary at day break to see most of the bird life on offer including eagles.  We all opted for a mid morning tour and unfortunately for us we should have listened to our guide as birds seemed to be sparse in the heat of the day. We did however take pleasure in seeing the surrounding rice paddy fields and other wildlife such as large squirrels.  Overall though it was an informative and enjoyable visit.,"October 12, 2022"

The park, as far as we saw it, consists of a red top road that winds through beautiful gnarled old trees providing perfect shade. There is just a small coloured sign at the ""entrance"" and nothing else. The wetlands, although fairly dry, still contained enough water to attract flocks of different birds, ibis, herons, ducks and we had good views of many individual birds, Golden Oreole, a hovering Black Shouldered Kite etc etc. Even without the birds the walk would have been charming: the views, the fresh breeze, the silence. There were no other visitors there! Go early morning to get the kindest light and the most bird activity.","August 29, 2019"

However this might have been because it is now the dry season and there is very little water around! Having said that ... we saw some very interesting birds in the very small tanks that are around.  It was also a very peaceful and tranquil area and it turned out to be a delightful afternoon. We saw no-one and there were no disturbances. I had taken my car which is something I certainly would not contemplate in the wet season.  Deep ruts on the tracks indicated that it might be a bit hairy in the rain.  The tracks we followed were very narrow mud lanes so clearly not suitable for regular cars.  But then I suppose you would normally go there on a 'safari'. The only downside was the lack of signage and information.  However this may well have been because it's out of season, or because we went privately instead of on a tour.  But if you're in to bird watching, I highly recommend a visit.","March 22, 2018"
