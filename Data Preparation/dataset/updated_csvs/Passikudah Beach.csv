Anyone who now assumes that this is due to tourism or pollution of the world's oceans, i.e. washed-up garbage, only has to walk along the public beach once in the evening to find that unfortunately the population itself makes a significant contribution to the destruction of this paradise.

As I mentioned in a previous review for Arugam bay, it was of season and they are recovering from being closed for 2 years for Covid. Positives: The resort is really beautiful and its situated on a magnificent beach. The people at the resort could not have been any friendlier and helpful. The upgrade they gave us had a swim up pool right to our room, which was fab. The resort is really a 5 start resort and it felt like that staying there. Food was very varied and really good Less positive feedback There was no more than 10 people at the resort while we were there, which made it feel empty. Most of the bars and restaurants that were advertised were closed. (only 1 was open) They set up a temp restaurant and bar, so when people were finished dinner it then closed. (around 8pm) We knew it would be off season, but didnt realise it would be so quiet, especially in the evening. I would certainly recommend Anantaya resort and Passikudah as a fantastic destination, but plan your visit between May and September, when all the facilities should be open.","April 7, 2022",0.0,0.0

The beach is beautiful and extremely clean.  I love the fact that you can walk far out into the water at this time of year and there is no strong current and it’s not deep. The beach is the best behind Anantaya, Maalu Maalu and Uga Bay.  However, if you go to the beach behind Anilana, it is terrible and you really can’t go into the water because all of the sand is covered with broken coral fragments.  I love Anilana hotel, but not the beach behind it. Don’t miss the wonderful sunrise on Pasikudah beach. In addition, take a walk down to the fishing village at the end of the beach in the early morning hours just after sunrise as that is when the fisherman pull in their nets.

However, we went for the 2km walk recommended by the hotel reception, along to the rocks. We walked past several hotels, all allowing access to the beach, without restricting it, which is lovely. However, once we passed the last hotel, the beach becomes dirty. Lots of rubbish washed up on the beach - bottles, flip-flops, empty sand or rice bags etc. This is extremely disappointing. In our opinion, the beach isn’t that long and the hotels should be responsible for cleaning up the shared sections too. This would be good for the environment also, clearing some of the rubbish out of the sea. It just served us with a stark reminder of how destructive the human race can be. On the plus side, we even saw a chameleon while out on our walk.

Beach is beautiful. If you want to buy fish. you can go to Pasikudah harbour (near Pasikudah beach) for cheapest, most fresh one. You can buy fish from the Waalachchena market also but little expensive than that of the Pasikuda beach. My family members and my relatives had unforgettable memories in our family get together trip to Passikudah Beach on the occasion of my sister in Law’s family coming home from abroad. Kids  loved to play in this beach. This is an amazing beach where we enjoyed a lot. Even there is a port also. We  spoke to fishermen also. They told that they caught many sea snakes recently  and they were in doubt whether it is a advance warning of a tsunami. You can bath in the sea without any fear but during these days there was red flag erected to give the Red Alert on account of the pressure depression in the Bay of Bengall. Dangerous areas are marked also therefore the visitors can identify them and avoid bathing in those locations. Since there is a port, you can enjoy with fishermen even you can help them to move boats. It is really amazing and it is a art that how they turn the boats without hard surface and tires. The beach has calm water mostly in the mornings and such a nice blue color to it. No major waves but simple ripples so it is very safe. Love this beach! Quite flat with nice and smooth sand so easy for long walks. The sand is gentle on the toe if you walk barefooted. Gentle surf and quite shallow. On a sunny day it is absolutely beautiful! The beach is lined with hotels for much of its length but they are set well back and low rise so you get the feeling of a tropical beach. Travel to Passikuda to explore the truly Sri Lankan cultural flavour. Takes approximately 6- 8 hours by car from Colombo. There is straight road from Kandy through Mahiyanagana which takes about 4 hours and you can visit hot springs with different temperatures at little off from Padiyathalawa. Can see the sunrise in the morning too. Beach area is well cleaned by the hotels concerned and it gives a pleasant feeling. I recommend to you to visit Pasikuda beach and enjoy yourselves.","December 20, 2017",0.0,0.0

We have visited three beaches in the east coast of Sri Lanka, Nilaveli Beach, Arugambay Beach and Passikudah Beach. Out of all I like Passikudah Beach very much. We have walk along the beach while we were in the Maalu Maalu Resort. It is a very long beach and you can walk miles along the beach. Several Hotels have come up along the beach and the beach is very clean. If you go to the beach in the early morning you could see the sunrise. During the North East Monsoon that is during December to February Wind is coming toward the land from the sea and sea may be fairly rough in the afternoon with the sea breeze and the seas are good for surfing. During the South West Monsoon period that is during May to September seas along the east coast is light. That period is the best period for sea bathing without any risk. November December period is the Cyclonic period and cyclonic storms may form in the Bay of Bengal and may cause very strong winds and very rough seas with rain and showers. If you are going to the beaches in the east coast during November and December better to watch the weather and find out whether there are any cyclone formation in the lower part of Bay of Bengal which may cause very bad weather over the Eastern side of Sri Lanka. Anyone who visit Sri Lanka should visit the Passikuda Beach.","October 4, 2017",0.0,0.0

It was tranquillity itself early in the morning and later in the evening.  The waters at the bay are shallow, blue-blue and clear as can be.  We waded up to about 50 metres out into the sea.  The coral reef out there in the fringe keeps the sea calm comfortable and pleasant for bathing.  We considered ourselves lucky to find this unspoiled clean and virgin beach and the bay where we immersed ourselves morning and evening to our hearts content. Passikudah in the East Coast was not a safe place to visit until after 2009.  But with the end of the war, this place has become a great tourist destination away from the hustle and bustle of the city and is booming with both local visitors and tourists.  There are many quality hotels bordering the beach.  We stayed at Amethyst Resort hotel. There is a fishing village nearby.  Small single-engined fishing boats arrive in the morning with their catch.  It was interesting to see how all around get together to push the boats inland away from the sea.  I saw a tourist too assisting in pushing a boat!  The fish brought in are sold at the beach.

We have rarely stayed in a hotel with such attentive, friendly and caring people, we felt genuinely touched by all their effort. We happened to have our 7th wedding anniversary whilst there, and as I wished my wife happy anniversary and tagged the hotel on Facebook, reception picked this up and we were surprised by a beautiful greeting on our bed. From there the team surprised us with a crazy flower arrangement and special anniversary dinner table in the garden, and on the leaving night - a dinner table set up on no other than a sunbed in the pool!! Totally unbelievable and unforgettable, we will always remember this. I don't know if we happened to be extra lucky/attended to as the hotel was fairly quiet this week, but either way, I know the staff and people at Anilana will do everything they can to make your holiday memorable.

The dinner buffet had a huge selection of dishes, and all of equally high quality. The hotel could offer better one day tour packages, as there's not much to do outside the hotel grounds, and can get boring if you don't want to sit by the pool all the time. The Spa looked good, but the prices are a little over the top, more than I would expect to pay in the UK. Also the outside pool needs some attention as a number of tiles had come away from the bottom, which could be potentially dangerous.

The tourism around this beach goes back way before the war that ended in 2009. However, since 2009 there has been much development, rapid in fact that saw and upward pace until it slowed down in 2014. So one has a few good hotels to stay right on the beach while there are guest houses and Inns within walking distance and off of the main road for those on a budget. As for good hotels, Uga Bay comes first to my mind. You cannot go wrong here. Malu Malu is the famous one whose name is synonymous with the word Passikudah but I have not been there to say much about it. The beach in front of Uga Bay is one of the cleanest and well kept and the same could be said about most of the expensive hotels on this beach. For those fans of beaches in California or South Florida, this would be a contrast in culture as one would find neither a like minded crowd nor beach bars lined up along the strip. This is instead a more ""private"" beach by local standards but it is not exclusively private. I say private simply because it does not have a populous neighborhood in the vicinity. No trains disturbing the tranquility here like in the southern beaches of Sri Lanka and it does make you want to be in it longer. This beach is crystal clear and picture perfect most of the year until the end of the year when the North-Eastern monsoon winds and rain come down hard in this area.
