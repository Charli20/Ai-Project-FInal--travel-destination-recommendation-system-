Go down into the valley behind the white stupa and then up the small path to the second on the rock opposite...a real Indiana Joes feeling. You climb up through rock gates, narrow paths and up from the stupa a sensational view into the bizarre landscape, speckled with large grant rocks.

As the drive is along the edge of Yala National Park, we saw almost as much game (elephant, spotted deer, water buffalo, warthog, deer, jungle fowl, peacock and aligator) has we had on a four hour safari in Yala block 1!  The temple was deserted when we arrived, so were able to spend time with the ranger discussing the history and significance of the site.  One climbs to both temple in sock, so be prepared for this.  The main temple only requires doing stairs, so if you have reasonable mobility it should be doable.  The higher temple involves stairs and also climbing the rock face with a handrail but only thin ""steps"" cut into the rock.  We were fascinated to hear that elephant walk up and down the stairs: on the last night hike our guide took guests, they came across an elephant making its way down the stairs and they were delayed by over 1 1/2 hours!  The dirt/brown stains on the top of some of the rock overhangs is from elephants making their way under the rock.  A great visit that I recommend.","September 5, 2024",0.0,0.0

On either side of the road was thick forest as it runs through Yala National Park.  Lo and behold!  There were three leopards right on the middle of the road, two adults and a cub.  We observed them without getting too close lest they go away.  I also did not have a long lens with me to photograph them as I did not anticipate an encounter with wild animals!  After a while they sauntered into the jungle and we proceeded to Situlpawwa, enjoying the beauty and serenity of the jungle. As we approached Situlpawwa car park area, there hundreds of wild-boars including many cubs – probably used to easy food from pilgrims and visitors.  There is a large parking area and a few shops catering to the pilgrim and devotees who visit here in numbers over weekends and full moon poya days.  There is a police post too at the edge of the parking area. Surrounded by thick jungle, the first to come to view was a stupa atop a hill.  As we came closer, another bigger stupa too became visible.  The smaller stupa atop the taller hill is Kuda (small) Situlpawwa while the larger one, visited by most devotees is called Maha (large) Situlpawwa.  On our ascent to the ancient Buddhist temple Maha Situlpawwa, we came across a troop of monkeys enjoying their breakfast on wild berries.  The path up to the 80-metre-high rock was on a gentle slope along ancient steps carved into rock.  Even those with mild knee problems in our group did not find the ascent tiresome as they could hold on to the handrail by the side.  At the very top is a notice advising pilgrims not only to remove their shoes but also to carry them along to prevent them from being lost to the monkeys who roam around freely. At the top of the rocky summit is the majestic stupa, about 12 metres in diameter, in the shape of a bubble, built by levelling the top of the rock.  We were told that this stupa dates back to 2nd century BCE.  From this vantage point we could see Kuda Situlpawwa, image house, various ruins of buildings and locations of bo-trees as well the pond used for bathing.  As we came down the southern steps built with stone, there were ruins of some small stupas on either side.  The southern steps end at the current temple premises that house an image house, sleeping quarters for the priests as well as an office, where one could make donations for the upkeep of the temple.  Walking further down into a lower area at the eastern side you come to the impressive cave temple.  There lie two Buddha statues one in sleeping position and the other seated.  The sleeping statue is over 8 metres long.  On the far side of the cave house are ruins of two statues with missing hands, housed in a pavilion for protection from the elements. I was absorbed by the symmetry, dignity and grace conveyed by these statues even though they had been damaged.  We were told that these images date back from the 4th century. The whole complex appeared to be well maintained and adequately take care of. We did not attempt to climb the taller hill, the Kuda Situlapawwa, as we were too tired and hungry.  As we walked back from the temple complex, there was an elephant, sauntering on the other side of the steel fence, just a few metres away, seeking food.  Though we were rather uneasy at first, the policemen told us that there was no cause to fear and that he is harmless.  He is apparently used to getting fruits fed by visiting pilgrims. Advise to visitors – Take a bottle of water along with you to quench your thirst. When you remove your shoes at the summit before entering the Stupa enclosure, carry them with you to prevent them from being hi-jacked by monkeys!  You can avoid having to walk on the hot rock if you climb early in the morning.  Entrance is free to all!!","February 27, 2019",0.0,0.0

Sithulpawwa  is known as a location where thousands of Arhaths lived at one time. According to folklore it is said that a novice monk called Thissa who has reached the state of Arhath lived here and later a stupa was built encasing his remains thus this also has been known as Tissa Thera Chetiya. Sithulpawwa Stupa Sithulpawwa Rajamaha Viharaya contains large number of stupas, cave temples, Buddha statues a stupa house and image houses spread among a large land area. Among these there is a cave temple with ancient paintings thought to be belonging to the 3rd century BC. These drawings have been done on a thin layer of plaster on the rock surface and primarily used red – yellow colours. The main stupa has been built by flattening the top of a rocky mountain. There are two approaches to the stupa. Stone steps have been cut from the south and the north. The boundary walls of the maluwa area have been built using large rocks. Remains of many buildings can be seen on the Northern side of the stupa. sithulpawwa rajamaha viharaya In addition to the main Sithulpawwa stupa another hill called the ‘Small Sithulpawwa ’ also contains similar stupa and buildings. Stupas have been built on each peak of this rocky mountain range and all these have been built in the Pre Christian Era. A large amount of valuable items has been found from the excavations on this site including an exclusively made image of goddess Thara in a seating position and many Buddha statues. Two Statues of the Awalokeswara Bodisattva can be seen on the main cave temple. One of these is dressed as a royal and the other is plainly dressed as a sage. A large number of rock inscriptions have been found throughout the vihara complex. All these belong to the pre Christian era and some letters in these inscriptions show localization effects compared to Inscriptions in the Anuradhapura in the same era. Some of these pre Christian inscriptions mentions two of the ‘Dasamaha Yodhayan’ (the ten giants in the Army of King Dutugemunu) called Nandimithra and Welusumana. Another giant of the ‘Dasamaha Yodhayan’ Pussadeva is also said to be from this area. According to the great chroricle Mahawansa, King Vasaba has built 10 stupas in the Sithulpqwwa (then Chiththal Pabbatha) According to stone inscriptions King Mahallaka Naga (134-146) has built stupas and donated land to the temple and the regional King Dappula of Rohana has donated the village called Gonmitigma in 659 AC.

Once you're at the top of the rock you can see the surrounding area. There're some archaeological sites in the immediate vicinity as well. There's another temple which requires a jungle trek and another hike to reach this. Unfortunately the Sun was going down & therefore we couldn't go the second temple.","July 3, 2013",0.0,0.0

(its 20+ km) from the main road and was quite bad before. If you are in the yala area its a good place to visit and if you are retuning from a morning safari in the national park there is a short cut , turning right soon after the park entrance that will bring you half way to the temple. This is aplace of bot religious and historic significance to the people of Sri Lanka and hence if you have any alcohol in your vehicle, you should leave it at the check point entrance and they will return it on your way back. alos note no shorts are allowed and you clothes must cover below the knee. They are quite strick about it.","June 19, 2013",0.0,0.0
