Make Reservations directly with the Restaurant,  the Buffet is roughly 20-30 dollars per adult, where I found some third party apps charging close to 60 USD per adult! Making a reservation was a little hard to understand,  but a text and a call and a little faith that they saved your reservation and you are in there,  they give a window, and not a specific time which took me a second to pick up on. When you arrive, dont be intimidated if there is a wrap around line outside, that line is for the observation deck. Just inform an attendant that you made a reservation and they will walk you directly to the elevator (making you feel a little bad for skipping the line, but also like a badass VIP) The windows closest to the windows are for couples only and do not rotate, but there is a rotating platform for the rest of the tables that my kids enjoyed. The view is amazing, we went at night so the lights were pretty, but I bet seeing it in the day is also great. The food was good, a mix of Sri Lankan, Indian and Chinese all in one Buffet.","November 30, 2025",0.0,0.0

Despite only been built a few years ago, the inside is already looking dated and old. The bathrooms are not in great condition and there are a few empty shops on the ground floor. The lift was not particularly modern looking either. However, it was nice seeing the views from the top and identify some of the landmarks. Although many of the signs do not actually line up with the landmark and is actually far to the left or right making it difficult to find them. Great to have this for locals as the only viewing tower in the country. However, there was nothing else of interest there. They still charged full price despite the Pixel Bloom under renovation for a couple of days (this was not explained until walking around aimlessly trying to find it). Okay experience but have seen plenty of other observation decks done a lot better and made more interesting. Hopefully improvements will be made to make this a focal attraction in Colombo in the future.","November 18, 2025",0.0,0.0

For instance, I recently observed 20–30 foreigners choosing not to pay the higher rates, while just as many expressed dissatisfaction on their way out. It raises the question: is this approach sustainable in today’s global tourism market? I had walked from Galle Face and decided to rest, but the experience left me reflecting on how this outdated pricing system affects Sri Lanka's appeal. Tourists increasingly share their experiences online, and negative feedback can deter potential visitors. As tourism evolves, Sri Lanka should consider modernizing its policies. A fair pricing system could significantly enhance the visitor experience, encouraging return visits and bolstering the country's reputation. Hopefully, as new generations step into leadership, they'll prioritize more inclusive and progressive approaches to tourism that benefit both visitors and the local economy. The price for this attraction is far too high and certainly not worth the money or a pleasant experience.","December 27, 2024",0.0,0.0

Firstly we were over charged by a Tuk Tuk driver for a 400 lkr journey where the driver tried to charge us 5000lkr. Upon arriving at the Lotus Tower we entered the queue and paid a fee of 11574lkr to get tickets to enter. This is 20$ us each for 2. We entered the building through an airport style security bag scan and then got in a queue for the lifts. Whilst presenting our tickets we asked if this was the way to the restaurant bar to which the answer was yes and our ticket stubs were torn so we proceeded with all the other guests to the lifts which took us directly to the top floor viewing point. Not knowing where the bar actually was we walked around looking for the bar restaurant to be told we had to go back to reception and then book on the 1st floor. We ventured back down to the ground floor and asked the staff about the  restaurant and we were told the ticket wasn't needed for entry to the restaurant and that it was for the digital art experience on the ground floor and viewing point only. By this point we were 20 mins in which is how long it took to get to the top and bottom again without stopping including queues. After explaining that we didn't realise we didn't need a ticket to A enter the building as this  is far from obvious to a foreign traveller and B we certainly wouldn't have purchased a ticket for a digital exhibition we had no interest in seeing. No we're a little confused so we asked for help and explained we don't want the exhibition or viewing point as there's plenty to be seen from a revolving restaurant anyway. The staff then laughed at us for being stupid foreigners who made a mistake and actually smiled the upset we got for buying something we don't use or need, further they weren't prepared to offer a refund and allow us to spend the money in the restaurant as it's apparently a separate business to the tower attractions. Standing in the lobby trying to explain our mistake made no difference to the staff and no matter who we spoke to on this subject we were treated with total disrespect and laughter at our mistake only to be told it's company policy not to offer refunds. Like we are trying to take something from them. We both found it rude and inconsiderate. We've spent plenty of money in Sri Lanka since visiting and tipped well everyone we visit. Sri Lanka as a whole we've found completely amazing. However 2 days from the end of our trip to be insulated and worse laughed at for an honest mistake was awful. Sadly we left not only without using the tickets or visiting the restaurant bar. What's more sad is that we couldn't even give the tickets to another couple outside as the first thing they do when you get in is tear the stub. Terrible experience, awful attitude from staff. Extremely disappointed.","December 17, 2024",0.0,0.0
