Compared to other parts of Colombo, the mall is very clean and well-maintained .Right opposite Beira Lake, it's a convenient spot to explore other parts of Colombo. Offers high-end stores and popular international brands. A wide range of cuisine options, from local Sri Lankan to fast food chains. It's an upscale mall, so expect higher prices for food and shopping compared to other areas of Colombo. Overall, Colombo City Centre seems like a great option if you're looking for a modern shopping and dining experience in Colombo. Our favorite place is scope cinema . Scope Cinemas is a Sri Lankan cinema chain known for providing innovative cinematic experiences. There are three locations in Colombo. This is their flagship location and boasts the most features. It has 6 screens, including one with Dolby Atmos sound and 4K projection. They also offer a luxurious ""Gold Class"" experience.","May 24, 2024",0.0,0.0

Unfortunately, most of the stores are just American luxury brands. I'm American and the prices of the clothing in those particular stores was baffling (80USD for an UnderArmor tank top), more expensive than what I pay in one of the most expensive American cities. We found a few stores that at first didn't look like American brands but after going inside we found just cheap clothing with American slogans. The mall does have a rooftop and we were lucky to find a band playing live music outside but again, they were singing covers of American pop songs. I just don't understand why anyone coming to Sri Lanka would want to shop in such an Americanized place, we surely didn't.

The screen is superb & the sound system is awesome. Even though the ticket price is a bit high, you can justify it based on the cinema experience you can have. Anyhow thanks to HNB Solo, I got an offer & I paid only for one ticket & I received one ticket FOC. However, the food you purchase from the theatre food outlet was terrible & the prices are too much high & not fare. I ordered one Coca-cola cup 300ml (180/=) bit higher than other places like KFC, McDonald's etc. & One Tipitip. According to the consumer law in SL, we can forget the price of Coca-Cola cup since the Coca-cola company don’t mention any maximum retail price for 300ml cup. But for Tipitip, the maximum retails price is clearly mentioned by the manufacturer & therefore no one can’t sell above that price according to the law in SL. On the other hand, they don’t allow you to bring at least a water bottle inside the movie theatre. So, if you want to have a good movie experience @ CCC Scope cinema, you have only two options. 1)	Just go there and enjoy the cinema without having any snacks or food. 2)	Or else pay a worthless high price for the snacks/foods & enjoy the cinema Finally, one more thing regarding the overall experience at CCC: Nothing special. The food is ordinary & overpriced. And It is just a shopping centre for the name.","August 20, 2019",0.0,0.0

For dinnerware (dishes etc) then Noritake and Dankotawa have several showrooms in the city.  Batik and hand painted silk - try Yoland (Crescat Boulevard), Buddhi Batiks(Ward Place) or ShreeDevi Batik (Marino Mall).  Costume and semi precious Jewellery - Stone n String (Galle Road).

I saw this Colombo City Centre opposite Seema Malakaya and decided to visit the shopping mall. The weather in Colombo in Mar was terribly hot and it was like discovering an oasis in a desert. The moment you walk into the building, the cool and refreshing air conditioner air immediately `quenched' and reduced the bodily heat temperature to a comfortable level. I found it cool and refreshing roaming in the comfortable environment and visiting the shops from the ground floor to the food studio and the cinema area. It was like any of the shopping malls in Singapore but such cozy medium scale shopping malls seem few in Colombo. The panoramic view outside the veranda of the food studio was spectacular. You could view Seema Malakaya and the adjacent Gangaramaya Park from a helicopter view. Colombo looks more like a metropolis with the lake in the center surrounded by skyscrapers. It was surprising to see a Singaporean Snacks food stall occupied the front visible row of the food court. A group of Chinese tourists sat at the middle seats in the food court munching their fast food burgers. A juice salad stall and a Dessert Bar occupied the central area and prominently displayed mouth watering juices to customers. I like the Cargills Food Hall (supermarket) at the basement. There was a promotional 50% discount for a Kist funfruit juices and I bought a packet of the mixed fruit juices and sat at a cozy relaxed corner just outside the supermarket enjoying and quenching my thirst. On one occasion, I bought a tub of Vanilla ice-cream and enjoyed my ice cream at the same corner. Outside the supermarket, there is a stall displaying a unique range of souvenirs and ornaments. The Spa Ayurveda shop looks unique with her attractive colorful design and I like the scent and aroma of the products in the shop. This is a great place to cool yourself and get refresh for the next adventure around Colombo. The short respite rejuvenated my spirit. I visited here for 3 occasions and would highly recommend you to be here for the panoramic view and cheap sales at the Cargills supermarket.","March 23, 2019",0.0,0.0

A quick review of the highlights: Chocolate Sorbert - rich, dark and so intensely flavored that it has to be savored in small tastes. It's the equivalent of aged brandy or very strong rum. Fior de Latte  - if you've never had it before, you must try it now! It's basically sweetened milk, a very pure, clean taste with just enough sweetness. There's no other way to describe it except milk with sugar turned into gelato somehow. Chunk in Yo Trunk- vanilla with brownie chunks and swirls of caramel, it's a gooey delicious treat. The brownies are homemade and absolutely fabulous! Bacio - the original Nutella ice-cream, Bacio is a combination of hazelnut and chocolate. It's a mild, smooth gelato, one with a more subtle flavor to it. Straciatella - delicious slivers of dark chocolate in a strong, creamy gelato. The chocolate is the good quality kind, you can taste the bitterness and the high cacao content in it, and the gelato is the perfect encasing for it.","November 6, 2018",0.0,0.0

It is a great place to shop, but even better to eat.  The new food court offers an amazing selection of different cuisines and seems to be the place to be seen and to meet new people. Apart from the great food, there is also the best cinema in Sri Lanka where you can catch up on the latest moves. Although not a touristy place, it is a great place for weary travelers to have a great meal and do some great shopping.","October 25, 2018",0.0,0.0

Of course the prices are quite expensive because the target audience of this mall is high income people. The food court of this mall is really amazing. You can have the food from different countries like Japan,China,Singapore, Indonesia and India etc.. The architecture of this mall is very similar to an international shopping mall in Dubai.

Besides that, still a lot of shops to be opened, which gives the entire mall an unfinished look. On the positive side: the Odel Department Store deserves a mentioning for being so large and organised. Hopefully they will keep it that way. Also the Miniso shop is lovely. And last but not least: the Food Studio offers a stunning view over the Beira Lake! Plenty of choice for foodies! Once the entire area is finished, it will certainly look astonishing, but... there are more malls coming right next door (Altair).","October 19, 2018",0.0,0.0
