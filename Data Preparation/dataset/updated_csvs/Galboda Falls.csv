From the station there's a very easy hike for about 1 hour to the falls. You can spend as much time as possible there, can even bath. Water is so cold ;) I woundn't say bathing is entirely safe for all ages since there are some pits under water :) You can finish everything within about 5 hours and come to station and catch the train around 4pm. It's a brilliant place for a oneday trip. Not only the water fall, path towards it is filled with beautiful scenaries. Highly recommend ;)","February 11, 2020",0.0,0.0

Journey en route would be a fascination ,specially from Nawalapitiya on wards.  Galbodde falls is about 20 minutes walk away for the station situated in a ravine above the station. The place is maintained by the local council and a ticket fee is charged. You could walk right under the cascade but keep an eye on possible change of water level .Place is suitable for bathing particularly in morning. Galboda is a selfie delight with its huge array of different view points. The journey needs to be planned to catch up on the down hill train reaching Galboda station by 220 pm. If you return back to the rail track early you would find sufficient time to do a walk along the track towards the two nearby tunnels for a fascinating time but please be alert to the up hill trains -two of them are scheduled  between 1pm to 2pm time.","November 22, 2019",0.0,0.0

But this time location is much commercialized. We had to pay 50LKR for the entrance ticket at the starting point of the trail. This was not last time I visited. Walking through the trail is amazing, lot of beautiful views. After walking 2-3 Km we met a beautiful tea plantation. At the end of tea plantation there will be a junction. And you dont want to confuse about the direction at this junction because they have marked the way to waterfall at a stone. We reached the falls just after 3 minutes walk from the junction. There are huts and children park near the waterfall which indicated that place is more commercialized. There was a small snack bar even. Be careful if you bath at falls.","February 16, 2018",0.0,0.0

There are, however, restrictions to how far you can walk up. Basically this falls isn't for swimming, it's more for show, but still beautiful. WARNING!!! There are a number of pushy paddlers and dodgy locals. Some offer you 'gifts' then soon return asking for a donation for their 'generosity'. And there was a civilian local walking around handing out parking tickets, I knew it was a scam and flat out refused until he backed off.
