Completed in 1921 during British rule, this iconic railway bridge spans 91 meters in height and stretches over 300 meters in length, arching gracefully across a lush, verdant valley. Its structure, characterized by nine large arches, is an awe-inspiring example of early 20th-century engineering, built using solid bricks and concrete without the use of steel. The bridge is strategically placed within a landscape of dense forests, rolling hills, and tea plantations, which offers visitors breathtaking panoramic views that have made it one of Sri Lanka's most photographed landmarks. As a key part of the railway line that connects Colombo to Badulla, the Nine Arches Bridge serves not only as a transportation route but also as a historical relic. The surrounding area, rich in biodiversity and serene beauty, has made it a prime destination for nature lovers, adventurers, and photographers. The bridge is often seen as a peaceful contrast to the hustle and bustle of urban life, offering a glimpse into Sri Lanka's colonial heritage. Tourists flock to this bridge to marvel at its intricate design and its ability to blend harmoniously with the surrounding natural environment. Whether visited during the misty mornings or the golden hours of sunset, the Nine Arches Bridge never fails to leave a lasting impression on those who encounter it. It remains an enduring symbol of Sri Lanka’s cultural and natural heritage, standing as a testament to the resilience of both the human spirit and the land it inhabits.","April 2, 2025",0.0,0.0

There is a car parking lot near the bridge (you have to walk a short distance from it to get to the bridge) but several kilometers away from the parking lot, the driver stopped and claimed that he couldn't go farther on the road and I would need to take a tuk tuk the rest of the way or walk 30 minutes. He said the tuk tuk would cost around 1,000 LKR but the only tuk tuk at the spot refused anything less than 1,500 LKR. Since I was already overpaying for the private driver I balked and it was at that point the driver told me he'd see how far he could go down the road.

This iconic bridge, nestled in the lush greenery of the hill country, offers an unforgettable experience and some of the best photo opportunities in the region. The bridge itself is an impressive feat of engineering, built during the colonial era. Its nine arches stretch across a beautiful valley, with dense forests and tea plantations surrounding it, creating a stunning contrast against the sky. Whether you’re walking towards it or viewing it from a distance, the Nine Arches Bridge is a sight to behold, and you can’t help but be in awe of its beauty. To get to the bridge, I took a short walk from the Ella town center. The path is relatively easy to follow, though a bit steep in places, but it’s well worth the effort. Along the way, I passed through picturesque tea estates and serene countryside, making the journey just as enjoyable as the destination.

However, it's not super accessible - we rented a tuk tuk and the roads there were a bit challenging and narrow. We parked up next to a lovely couple's food place and walked the last 500m to the bridge. They watched our tuk tuk for us whilst we were at the bridge. The views are amazing and it's worth a visit. A word of warning though, there are wasp nests under the bridge that went into an angry swarm whilst we were there. I was stung on my face and my partner was stung on his hand. There are no signs warning about this and there are lots of people standing/sitting on the edge of the bridge to get that perfect Instagram photo. It worried me that if they were stung during a swarm, they could fall off the bridge and get seriously injured. There are mesh buildings around the bridge, which we went into, but the wasps all swarmed in there as well, so we just ran away from the bridge and back to the safety of our tuk tuk. The lovely couple helped us out with first aid (ayuverdic balm is amazing stuff!), food and tea whilst we recovered from the ordeal.

And at a very good price. They were with their husband and 2 children (8 and 9 years old). Our tour started from the hotel. The ride was comfortable in an 8-seat Minivan, and there were four of us. First we stopped at the observation deck by the waterfall. Guide then purchased tickets and put us on a train to Elle. We drove across the bridge admiring the posh nature out of the window, the tea plantations. And certainly didn't miss the chance to take beautiful and dangerous photos leaning out of the train.  The trip itself lasted 15 minutes. Then they got off at the next station where the Guide in the car was waiting for us and we went to the famous bridge. The road down is difficult to travel by car, there are tuk-tuks on the descent offering their services. We took advantage of them. And so my dream came true, we saw a nine-arch bridge. So I want to write how important it is to dream and travel, because in travel - noticed that time moves differently!

Until I wrote this post, I didn’t really bother with this issue. It turns out that there are more than enough of them - STONE bridges in the world. True, there are not so many bridges made of stone, whose arched spans are at least 50 meters. Surely you have heard of the Juxigou Bridge in China, the Maidenhead Viaduct in England, the Solkan Bridge in Slovenia, the Heather Bridge in Iran, the Wiesen Viaduct in Switzerland, the Pont de Vieille Briude in France, etc. In total, I managed to count about six dozen wide-span bridges around the world. In reality, there are many times more stone bridges with narrow spans. But they are no less interesting, take the word of an old travel lover!!! But!!! How many of these STONE bridges are railway bridges? Even clever Wikipedia couldn’t answer this for me. During my trip to Sri Lanka, I was able to get acquainted with the local must see, which represents one of the best examples of colonial-era railway construction in Ceylon. Moreover, as they say, “three in one”: this is a BRIDGE, it is STONE and it is RAILWAY!!! I'm talking about the Nine Arches Bridge - the Bridge of Nine Arches. It is built across a swampy lowland near the village of Gotuwala between two railway stations - Ella and Demodara. This bridge is one of the favorite places for party-juice of insta-people: 9 out of 10 travel lovers will definitely not fail to visit this object to photograph the architectural ingenuity of the creators of the Bridge and the abundant tropical greenery on the nearby hillsides, and then post their smiling photo in the virtual world. For lovers of historical and engineering precision, the Nine Arches Bridge is a pain in the ass: only its dimensions are known from accurate information (length - 91.44 meters, width - 7.62 meters, height - 24.38 meters). AND THAT'S ALL!!! As for the time of its construction: according to one piece of information, work on the construction of the bridge began in 1912, according to another - a year later. If you believe some sources, the completion date of the mega-construction is 1921, others claim that it is 1923. At least a report entitled ""Construction of a Concrete Railway Viaduct in Ceylon"" was published by the Ceylon Engineering Association in 1923. Most guidebooks, as a rule, attribute the construction of the bridge to the local Ceylonese builder P.K. Appukhami in “co-authorship” with some British engineers. In fact, there is a funny legend circulating regarding Comrade Appuhami and his role in the construction of the bridge. Evil tongues claim that he is not a builder. Allegedly in 1912, the popular drummer and performer of “devil dances” (yakṣa næṭuma) in Ceylon P.K. Appuhami was returning with another panty in the lift of that same Devil-Yaksha (Yakṣayā). At the station in Ohiya, he came across a certain son of Foggy Albion, who almost “did not move his horses” from fright, seeing the Yaksha appearance of our Phil Collins, Dave Grohl and Cozy Powell of the Sri Lankan “spill” in “one bottle”. Thank God, the Briton did not “grunt” and through him Appuhami ended things with the bridge builders and, as some not very trustworthy sources say, received the unofficial status of the chief engineer of the project. Whether this is true or not - only the drummer himself knows... The chief designer and manager of the “Railway Line to Ceylon” project was D.J. Vimalasurendra, supposedly another eminent Ceylonese engineer and inventor. The designer of the viaduct is said to be Harold Cuthbert Marwood of the Railway Construction Department of the Ceylon State Railway. And another epic Aboriginal tale associated with the personality of P.K. Appuhami: British engineers, led by the mentioned Mr. Marwood, have completely broken their heads, excuse the tautology - how to install 9 columns in the swampy quagmire of a valley? And then again - and like a jack-in-the-box, that same Appukhami!!! Ceylon drummer proposed an ingenious move, like “cowards worth a ruble or forty,”: throwing huge boulders into the depression until they fill it. And on this “piled foundation” the columns were then installed!!! The huge bridge is located at an altitude of 945 meters above sea level, which is why its second name is “Bridge in the Sky”. By the way, the uniqueness of this railway bridge beauty lies in the fact that it is entirely built from rocks, bricks and cement - without the use of steel or iron!!! And again, another story: when construction work began, the First World War broke out almost immediately. And, quite expectedly, the front needed iron... It seems that everything is clear: no material - no bridge!!! But the skillful Ceylonese peasants took and built the Bridge from bricks, cobblestones and cement. Without iron, therefore... How long can you do it skillfully? And now - from the realm of mysteries and mysticism... When I saw the Nine Arches Bridge, I was struck by the feeling of that same déjà vu: I have already seen this building!!! Well, or something very, very similar!!! Of course: Istanbul's Bozdogan, Tarragona's ""Devil's Bridge"", Rome's Parco degli Acquedotti... And what do we get? Dear Sri Lankan bridge builders, I suppose, who had no idea about antiquity, simply erected a unique arched bridge in the style of ancient Roman viaducts without any iron load-bearing elements, using only stone, brick and cement??? A masterpiece of bridge construction based on technology a couple of millennia old??? Do you believe this yourself, my dear reader??? Go ahead. Surely you noticed the unique bricks from which the bridge was built. The surface of the bricks is not flat, but convex (external lining) or concave (internal lining). So: neither the then Ceylon nor the metropolis (that is, Britain) knew the technology for making such figured and, as it turned out, durable bricks. And you, like the author of these lines, will probably not find information about where this brick was made. But this is not ten, not a hundred, or even a thousand pieces of figured brick - it had to be made somewhere??? Next - the very same - and again I use this word - UNIQUE - concrete: eternal, which resembles antique, the secret of which scientists have not yet unraveled (this concrete only becomes stronger over time, unlike modern concrete). More riddles? Yes, easily - I have them!!! Have you noticed the “smoky” appearance of the structure? It was so blackened already about 80 years ago - look at the photo from the middle of the last century!!! But how and why did “Bridge to Heaven” become so terribly “smoky” in such a short period of time??? One more thing: after the discovery of photography in 1822 by the French inventor Joseph Nicéphore Niepce, the topic of capturing everything and everyone quickly spread throughout the world. And the British, with their usual scrupulousness, began to photograph those same “everything and everything,” especially focusing on some significant events (including in the dominions and colonies). So - it turned out to be impossible to find ANY photographs of the construction of this grandiose facility for Ceylon!!! I don’t want to seem suspicious, but don’t you think that the Nine Arches Bridge was built, after all, not on the officially announced dates (the beginning of the 20th century) and not by British-Lankan builders, as the official history says??? This, I am not afraid of this word, artifact in its mystery is very reminiscent of the carved columns of the temple in the Indian city of Shravanabelagola, the Inca polygonal masonry in Peruvian Ollantaytambo, the dolmens of the Western Caucasus, stone balls at the mouth of the Costa Rican Diquis River, the Newgrange mound in Ireland, the White Pyramid in Chinese province of Shaanxi, Skara Brae complex on the shores of the Scottish Bay of Skyll etc. That is, those very objects whose origin modern science is unable to explain... As a version: for the railway “Bridge to the Sky” in Sri Lanka, they simply took and adapted an already existing ANTIQUE VIADUCT!!! I answer the question in the air - why was the construction of the bridge attributed to the Sri Lankans (plus the “co-authors”, the British)? When there is no explanation for how an ancient Roman viaduct appeared on an island in the Indian Ocean, it occurred to someone “wise” to simply invent and fit the inexplicable fact described above into the official version. By the way, the Bridge of Nine Arches has NEVER been restored - it has retained its original charm and is still functioning. Isn't this a miracle??? Or just another mystery of an ancient civilization (by the way, maybe even an alien one). Highly recommend!!!","March 18, 2024",0.0,0.0

The masses standing at the bridge and walking around all around the place are taking a lot of atmosphere out of the place that was originally a hidden gem. It's almost impossible to take a nice picture, similar to those that you can google anywhere on internet. I can imagine that the place might be a bit more interesting when there is a train passing through the bridge, almost mostly for the pictures, but I also can't imagine amount of people standing there. It must be even more as when the train is not passing, which is most of the day time. The biggest challenge is to get to the place. I don't recommend to hike, as the road through woods is narrow and very muddy. Plus there are a lot of tuk tuks passing by. Then there is no parking place at the top of the hill under the bridge. Both cars and tuk tuks are parking on the side of the road, blocking some side roads or that main road itself. But I still think that tuk tuk is the best option how to get to the place. The place itself is free of charge. There are few stands with grilled corn or with coconut nuts.","April 10, 2023",0.0,0.0

The bridge itself is a marvel of engineering and design, with its high arches spanning across a lush valley surrounded by verdant trees and tea fields. As you make your way across the bridge, you'll be rewarded with stunning views of the surrounding countryside and the distant mountains, making it an unforgettable sight. One of the best ways to experience the Nine Arch Bridge is by taking a train journey through the hills and valleys of Sri Lanka. The train ride is a wonderful opportunity to sit back, relax, and soak in the scenery as you wind your way through the hills and forests. As the train approaches the bridge, the anticipation builds, and once you're on the bridge, you'll feel like you're walking on air as you take in the magnificent views. Overall, I highly recommend a visit to the Nine Arch Bridge to anyone who appreciates natural beauty, engineering feats, or simply wants to experience something truly unique and unforgettable. It's a must-visit destination that will leave you awestruck and inspired, and it's definitely worth the journey.","March 18, 2023",0.0,0.0

Yes, it's an impressive piece of railway engineering, and is probably the 'best' bridge on Sri Lanka, but its hardly unique. But anyway, we went to see it, and spent half an hour taking pictures, and waiting for the train to show up. It's not the easiest of places to get to, as you have to park up and trek along a very uneven path to get there. This is the most direct route, and still takes about 15 minutes, There are other routes, so there might be some disabled access, but I doubt it. The access on to the bridge is surprisingly easy - there were people everywhere - no safety concerns here. On the tracks, on the parapets, or just hanging around - loads of tourists. We waited for the train, but like all the trains in this lovely country, it was late. After the best part of an hour, we gave up and walked back. Interesting, but like I said, it's just a bridge.

This was a good plan as for the equivalent of about £4, the tuk tuk driver took us down a pathway, we walked 100 steps to the railway line and walked along the line with him for about half a mile, and got to the bridge.  He came with us and stayed with us and took us back.  The bridge is a sight well worth seeing - build entirely of stone and cement, after the steel was withdrawn for the 2WW effort.  It is truly stunning. There is a little industry grown up around the bridge with makeshift cafes and souvenirs.  Plenty of locals go to see the train passing by too.  The tuk tuk driver knew exactly when the train was due to pass and made sure we were safe on the side of the track.  It's quite an experience for us health and safety mad westerners!!

If you take the first path  tuk-tuks ( if you wish to take) will take you right to the bridge. The second foot path tuk-tuks will take you close to the bridge but have to track in a steep down hill to reach the bridge. Which path to take depends on how adventurous you are.

There are not enough signs to show you how to reach this point and definitely not enough coverage about how steep and slippery the slope could be on the way to the bridge.  Hope whoever reading this will find the following tips helpful: 1) If you take the entrance near 98 Acres, the entrance has a mini colorful Hindu shrine and a coconut stand. Follow the signs and walk uphill until you reach a fork with no sign in the middle of the hill, take the left fork that will bring you through a muddy path and keeps walking for another five min or so before you can see the bridge below you on the far left.  I was told there are other ways to get there but this path brings you to the classic instagram shot of the bridge when the train hits. 2) If you choose to take this path, then beware of a very slippery muddy slope. It was drizzling when we were in the middle of walking toward the nine arch bridge. Both my partner and I were in sneakers and we were slipping and almost fell on a few occasions when we tried to climb down the slope.  Many people also found it challenging towards the end. I am a 5 feet 2 Asian who rarely exercised. I managed to get down in one piece using an umbrella as a hiking stick and towards the end I had to rely on my hand on the ground to keep myself from slipping a few times.  I also had help from my partner and a few kind tourists.  I would feel a lot safer with trekking shoes and a hiking stick, and I would not recommend visiting this place if it is raining. 3) Try to ask your hotel for the train schedule. The experience was so much more fun with the train passing by with passengers waving and cheering. A few brave tourists sat on the bridge when the train passed by.  It took me about 50 minutes to walk from 98 Acres resort to the bridge.  On the day I went, which was a Sunday, I was told trains would pass through the bridge around 9:20am, 1:45pm and 3:15pm.","December 23, 2019",0.0,0.0

How to reach - There are two ways to reach here. One is the longer, flat road which is usually taken by tuk tuks. If you do not want to hike then choose this road. The tuk tuk might take 800-1000 LKR to bring you here and back. Another route is the one followed by people on foot or who like to hike. The hike is moderate. You need to hike down the hill on your way to the bridge and then go up on your way back. There are no stairs for most part of the hike and you will have to climb up and down rocks so dress appropriately. When to go - If possible, time your visit such that you can see a train passing through the bridge. It's not a big deal, but if you have the time and you are already visiting the bridge, then why not? You can ask the locals and they will be able to help you with the exact time of train crossing through the bridge. Trains are almost always on time. How much time to spend - You can easily spend an hour here taking pictures of and with the bridge and the tunnel. If you have time to kill you can also take a stroll through the tracks. There are a couple of makeshift coconut vendors along the track but nothing else to eat or drink. There is, however, plenty of place to sit and watch the bridge. So you can also bring some snacks and sit here overlooking the natural beauty. Can be a little picnic.","November 18, 2019",0.0,0.0

The road to the bridge is in bad state of disrepair and narrow with sharp curves.  Although we hired a tuk-tuk, one can walk from the Ella station, along the railway line, to the Nine Arch Bridge, a distance of about 3 kilometers. There are only a few trains plying this route.  The tuk-tuk driver hurried along to be in time to show us the train crossing over the bridge.  The bridge, as the name suggests, is built over nine arches atop tall walls, and runs over the 100 ft deep ravine.  It is called the ""sky bridge"" emphasising the depth of the ravine.  On that beautiful sunny morning, it was a wonderful sight to observe the train moving over this unique bridge. The train moved slowly over the bridge allowing me to capture a few attractive photographs. The bridge had been commissioned in 1921, built during the British Rule.  The world war I broke out while it was being built.  The consignment of steel earmarked for the bridge was diverted to the army for projects associated with the war.  If steel were available, the bridge could have been built with only two or three spans across the ravine.  Since there was no steel available, the engineers incorporated eight shorter spans supporting the bridge over these nine convex arches.  Blocks of stone joined together with cement were the sole construction materials used in its construction. On its journey from Ella to Demodera the railway line passes through a 60 metre long tunnel about 75 metres after the arch bridge.  Don’t miss out on taking a photo with you at the entrance to the tunnel!  There were many excited tourists watching the train moving along!!

Just follow the Passara Road from the centre of town for about 600m and you’ll pick up the trail on your left.","August 14, 2019",0.0,0.0

The track down was way to treacherous for this middle aged couple. Wonderful cold fresh fruit juice drink while sitting in the cool and taking photos, watching people walk the bridge.","August 13, 2019",0.0,0.0

Accessible by foot or tuktuk only not too far from the town. Know before you go what time the train is coming and go at least 45 minutes early as it gives you time to take pics. Bring some rupee change and put it onto the tracks right before the train comes for souvenirs. Watch out for the bees.,"August 12, 2019",0.0,0.0

But it’s often full of other tourists and busy during the day. So go early or later in the day for a more intimate look. Be aware that there are trains that come through on occasion so if you walking along the tracks or are on the bridge, ensure you are clear of the tracks when they roll through.","August 11, 2019",0.0,0.0

Its about 10-15 minute walk to the bride. We got there and the views are great we stayed for a train to come. The times are posted on a tree on the way to the bridge !! You can stay on the bridge as the train crosses. Great once in a lifetime experience.,"August 6, 2019",0.0,0.0
