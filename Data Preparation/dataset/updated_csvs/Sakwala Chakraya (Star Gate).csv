We were particularly lucky to meet 2 local people who had been archaeologically active there for some time and were able to give us valuable information. We stayed at the site for almost 2 hours to meditatively tune into the profundity of the Star Gate symbols and absorb these energies. We definitely felt a strong power here. As I said, apparently nothing special - if you are energetically sensitive you will find a wonderful place here.","February 27, 2025",0.0,0.0

If you are interested in astrology this is one of the must visit place in Anuradhapura. It is just walking distance from ""Isurumuniya temple"" located near ""Ranmasu Uyana"" near lake. some people had viewed this place as star gate. because if you see carefully this star gate. It is showing unknown animals and some unknown symbols. Some people say this is the prove that ancient people had connection with aliens. Because this symbols are looking like speedometers of flying object. still there are not any prove what it is. There is parking space available near ""Isurumuni' temple. And entrance is totally free to this place.","December 17, 2017",0.0,0.0

It is still a mystery, and no one has been able to confirm what each sign of symbol means. It is a place worth visiting, for anyone who visits Isurumuniya. There is a foot path leading off the car park, and in five minutes you are at this rock inscription. next to it is the famous Gold Fish Pond. then you can climb up to the bund of the Tisaweva and walk back to the car park.","October 12, 2016",0.0,0.0
