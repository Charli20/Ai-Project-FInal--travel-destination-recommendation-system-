We observed more than a hundred elephants roaming and feeding on the lush banks of the reservoir. During our viewing, a male elephant that had been following a female suddenly turned, using its trunk to forcefully butt two safari jeeps. The second butt was so powerful it lifted one side of the jeep off the ground. This viewing experience was both captivating and thrilling.","November 3, 2025",0.0,0.0

Getting into the park was quick and easy. Within the first few minutes of entering the park, we saw our first elephant and then as we rounded the corner we were in awe of the herds that were gathered around the park. Amongst the many elephants, we witnessed many babies (just weeks old), mothers and the odd lone male all in their own natural environment.  Our jeep driver was very respectful of the elephants and kept his distance, allowing us to take in the truly fantastic moment. Additionally, the park was a lot quieter than we imagined. Driving around we also noticed other animals and a variety of bird species. This was one of our highlights of travelling around Sri Lanka and recommend this to anyone debating whether to visit or not- we actually preferred this safari over the Yala one.","August 29, 2025",0.0,0.0

On our mid-Aug visit, us tourists outnumbered the 100 or so elephants gathered at the reservoir. And phalanxes of jeeps almost blocked the path that the elephant families use to go from the forest to the reservoir. The herds had to pass through a gap in the wall of jeeps, perhaps deliberately to channel them so that tourists could take photos close up. Quite unethical. Seemed to stress out the elephants: one indignant mama raised her trunk and blasted the jeeps while her baby ran away. Apart from the Asian elephants, the “safari” as a whole was underwhelming, with scarce wildlife—saw some buffaloes, a serpent eagle, heron, couple of grey langurs.

The park itself is surrounded by lush greenery, open grasslands, and peaceful scenery. From the moment we entered, the excitement built up. After a short ride through the forest, we spotted our first elephant… and then another… and then a whole group! 🐘 We saw babies, mamas, and even a few lone bulls, all moving gracefully in their natural habitat. It wasn’t rushed or touristy — it felt authentic, calm, and respectful to the animals. Our driver kept a good distance, allowing us to watch without disturbing them. Watching them in their natural home, completely free, was such a touching and unforgettable moment. What made the day even more special was the kindness of the owner of our hotel, Sigiriya Cashew Palace Resort, who personally took us to the safari. He made sure we had a wonderful experience from start to finish. After the safari, he even stopped along the road to buy us fresh coconut to drink while we watched the sunset. Such a simple gesture, but it meant so much. If you’re planning a trip to Sri Lanka and want to connect with both nature and kind-hearted people, I highly recommend visiting Kaudulla and staying in Sigiriya. This day left me with memories I’ll cherish forever.","July 23, 2025",0.0,0.0

This wildlife sanctuary is famous for its stunning reservoir that attracts a plethora of wildlife, particularly the hundreds of Asian elephants that roam freely within the park. The park's unique selling point lies in its impressive elephant gatherings, known as ""The Gathering"", where herds of these majestic creatures congregate around the reservoir during the dry season. Watching these gentle giants interact with each other against the backdrop of lush greenery is an awe-inspiring sight to behold. Visitors can embark on safari tours through the park and witness not only elephants but also a wide array of other exotic species such as sloth bears, sambar deer, and various bird species.

It seems there are no limits placed on the number of safari Jeeps pouring into the park at any given time. Sadly humans continue to be the biggest threat to wild animals and that was very clear during our visit today. Yes we saw lots of elephants BUT it was so overcrowded with Jeeps  gathering around the elephants and at one stage there was a family of elephants making their way over the the lake when they couldn't get through the barrier of Jeeps. One of the elephants became upset as they were obviously protective of their babies and found the hoards of people/Jeeps a threat. These are endangered animals and they deserve a helll of a lot more respect than we are currently showing them. I regret joining this tour, as did the other 3 in our group, it is distasteful and I would recommend giving it a miss until there are regulations s in place that actually consider the wellbeing of these beautiful animals and restricts the number of cars flowing in.

We checked with Rana's information counter and were informed that the elephants were in Kaudulla, so booked a safari here. We booked the afternoon slot and entered the park around 3.00 P.M. We saw a lot of elephants and big herds of wild buffaloes soon after entering the park. At the lake, we saw a big herd of elephants, including some cute baby elephants. Overall, this was a great experience and we thoroughly enjoyed watching elephants so close and in their natural surroundings. On the cost - we checked with a few operators and ones we approached through the hotel and our driver quoted prices around 30,000 LKR (inclusive of tickets and the jeep). We then went to the main road and checked with a  few tour operators who had their offices there, where we found Rana's information agency, and booked the safari for LKR 19,000 (inclusive of tickets and the jeep). An alternative would be to check the prices of the jeep only and book tickets yourself. This will allow you to negotiate the price of the jeep (the tickets will cost the same as they are issued by the government). The only issue with this is that you will spend quite sometime in talking to various people and negotiating rates, while you potentially save 1 - 2,000 LKR, so the savings might not be worth the time spent).","October 19, 2019",0.0,0.0

Before visiting Kaudulla, I had said that I would be happy to see three elephants! I had done quite a bit of research regarding the safari's and elephant sanctuaries in Sri Lanka and both Minneriya and Kaudulla were the ones that came up as the most ethical while others just seemed a bit sketchy or disrespectful in terms of the space given between the jeeps and elephants. Sometimes you just have to go and see it for yourself and so we did. The national park is a big land and the elephants are entirely free to wander through Kaudulla and Minneriya without direct interaction with people. If you have a good camera, you're in for a treat. We saw hundreds of elephants! Yes, there are a lot of jeeps but I felt like the drivers kept a respectful distance at all times and even to one another so as not to hog all of the space. We were often quite far away from the elephants and only close if the elephants were coming toward us or passing by us so I'd recommend buying a good zoom lens if you don't have one. My camera had an unfortunate accident in some torrential rain in Ella so I had to make do with my phone but I still got some really great pictures and even better memories. All in all, this was a major highlight of a full-on trip and I would definitely recommend it. I think it cost us around $60 USD each and I felt like we got our money's worth.","October 6, 2019",0.0,0.0

Three of us, my wife, our grandson and I were picked up at 2.30pm on 20th July 2019, by our safari jeep from TripAdvisor sponsored Lakpura LLC.  The journey from our hotel in Habarana to Kaudulla park entrance took about 40 minutes.  After the driver of the jeep, Asela, purchased our entry tickets, we entered the park at 3.30pm and drove on a bumpy road through the dry evergreen forest.  There were over 100 jeeps witnessing this epic spectacle of elephants. As we neared the reservoir, we saw a long line of elephants ambling along towards the centre, towards the water.  As they neared the water, they became impatient and hurried on faster.  It was a fascinating spectacle to see such a large group drinking at the same time, first sucking in through their trunks and then delicately elevating the curved trunk to drop the water into the open mouth. As the water level in the reservoir recedes during the dry season, grass growing on the banks attract elephants from a vast area around.  It was an incredible sight to experience them eating this lush green grass on the banks.  The big elephants first displace the soil with their fore legs to loosen the grass.  Then they collect them nimbly with the tip of their trunk and dash them a few times on the ground patiently to remove the soil before gently curving their trunks to put the cleaned lump of grass into its pink coloured large mouth.  Little ones trod behind their moms, learning the intricacies of retrieving the lush grass from the ground.  Other groups of elephants were frolicking in the water.  I photographed two youngsters having a mock fight. The reservoir is the centre of all wildlife within the park. It is a paradise for birds. We saw large numbers of water loving birds - ducks, painted storks, egrets, ibis, pelicans, Cormorants, lapwings, herons and other species.  We saw a few fish eagles too.  There are deer and other wild animals.  Visitors however, come here mainly to see the elephants foraging and frolicking in large numbers. This elephant gathering takes place annually either at Kaudulla or close by Minneriya reservoirs during the months of July to September. Before deciding on the venue for your safari it is best to enquire from the safari company where the elephants are. This ""Elephant Gathering"" is an unique, incredible spectacle for wildlife enthusiasts. We go there at least once a year to witness this great spectacle and display.","August 14, 2019",0.0,0.0

You can spend hours watching them, particularly as there were many youngsters on show during out visit. Our only concern was that some animals appeared anxious, angry or both at the 60 or so vehicles full of local and international tourists lined bumper to bumper to see them. However, most appeared to accept it as part of life and just did what elephants do at a respectful distance. Thanks to the number that hung around, this was a great opportunity to see lots of interaction between the animals, including youngsters and their mothers.

What good advice! We had a guide in an ancient jeep, which rattled along the road from Habarana, but it was to prove its worth later on, as we saw lots of fancy modern ones stuck in the mud. It takes a while to get into the park itself, but the scenery is good, and as you enter you start to see lots of birds - my favourites were the painted storks. Although the day was dry, it was still extremely muddy in places, and there are not really proper tracks. Each driver picks a line and goes for it, which resulted in us seeing 3 or 4 jeeps being pulled out of the mud by other drivers. We were beginning to think it wasn't our day for elephants, when we saw a group ahead, surrounded by jeeps. The elephants were clearly used to this, and didn't seem phased by it, but were careful to protect the two youngsters with them. It improved as we moved further on, and the jeeps spread out a bit. It was incredible to see so many elephants (probably in excess of 50) in one place, and in such beautiful surroundings beside the lake. I'm not really bothered about seeing birds, but there were quite a few to interest those that are, including an eagle. On our way out of the park at dusk, we were still seeing more elephants, walking through the edges of the forest. Absolutely a day to remember.","December 6, 2018",0.0,0.0

There were more Jeep’s than elephants and the grasslands around the lakes were being trashed by so many jeeps. Jeeps getting bogged was a common sight.

There were just the two of us and the driver in our jeep, so no jostling for position to get a good view! Once off the forested entry track the park opens up into a vast grassland around a large lake. Obviously the main draw here is the elephants and we saw hundreds of them in large family groups, feeding, interacting and playing naturally, and it seems undisturbed by the jeeps travelling around. There is also an interesting array of birdlife plus water buffalo and deer. As the only route into the park is via a jeep excursion there were quite a lot of vehicles, but they do all split off in different directions around the park and once positioned with a view of the animals the engines are turned off so you can have a more peaceful view. We instructed our driver whenever we were ready to move to another spot and in total spent around two hours on the park, which was sufficient time to take in the scenery and wildlife and capture some memorable moments on camera.

We rented a jeep and driver outside that drove us in. The entrance process is a circus, ironic for an elephant viewing place. You will be surprised at how many jeeps go in at once; I think maybe 20 or so all drive around a set track. You WILL see elephants and the views are stunning. We were treated to a storm on the horizon which made it spectacular. I don't wish to be overly negative but the park rangers should have more of a presence. At one point other jeeps coralled the elephants in and they became distressed protecting their young, trumping and huddling around. Could have been avoided by the driver keeping clear for 30 seconds more. All in all though some amazing sights and a smoother entrance process would make it excellent.","September 28, 2018",0.0,0.0

When we arrived in Habarana, we were told that Kaudulla is the better place to be at that time.  So We spent two evenings at Kaudulla National Park watching herds of elephants – mums, kids, babies and bulls – playing, feeding and frolicking. In April the Minneriya and Kaudulla reservoirs are full.  By August with the release of water for irrigation, the water level recedes and fresh grass starts to grow on the banks nourished by the sediment left behind by the retreating waters.  Elephants from close by and far-away congregate here to feed on this succulent fresh grassland.  This phenomenon had been there for centuries after the construction of these reservoirs in the 3rd century AD.  Elephants do come quite close to the jeeps and did not appear to be aggressive.  Let us hope that the human-elephant conflict would not disturb this eco-system in the years to come! On a daily basis, during the season, over 300 jeeps enter the Kaudulla Park with tourists, to see this great spectacle.  The road approaching Kaudulla is being upgraded resulting in slow traffic movement.  Though we arrived early at around 1500 hours, we had to stay in the queue of vehicles for about half an hour to get our entry permits.  Once we entered the park it was more peaceful.  If you are a photographer you should station yourself so that the elephants are lit by the golden sunlight.  The jeep drivers are experienced and park themselves in optimum positions to allow you to witness and capture these moments with your cameras. We shall go there again next year too!!","September 11, 2018",0.0,0.0

I ended up with a concussion. If this was in the US, several companies would have already been sued, so precautions would have been made! Here, no ones warns, there are no signs and yet, we heard from many who made the same mistake and ended up with very painful heads. So watch out.

We were told by a few local people that Minneriya National Park didn't have as many animals as it often does this time of the year so we took the recommendation to go to Kaudulla instead. We weren't disappointed with the park! It was slightly cheaper than Minneriya (although I can predict the prices may go up as they are even doing up the roads leading up to the park probably for more tourists). It's also not as busy as Minneriya can get which is nice but the main reason I can't give five stars is due to the level of tourism now at all these national parks. It's lovely to see these beautiful animals in their wild habitats, however I can't help but begin to see these national parks as a zoo or large tourist safari park like you get in western countries. There are so many jeeps that at times it looks as though the elephants are closed into spaces due to the jeeps all around them. This isn't all the time which is fortunate and seeing elephants (around 60 on the day), monkeys, plenty of birds and even a crocodile was amazing! I would definitely recommend Kaudulla National Park and it's worth taking local advice as many people work in tours and can recommend what the animals are doing at that particular time of the year (they are likely to charge you the same jeep hire price regardless of if you go Minneriya or Kaudulla). Enjoy the amazing animals but let's hope they begin to limit the number of jeeps allowed in at any time, otherwise this incredible national park will look more and more like a cruel zoo. Recommend: Doing your research on credible touring companies and jeep hire before you go. Otherwise you may end up booking a firm who over charge or try to squeeze more money from you through pressure sales or tips at the end. Otherwise enjoy!! :)!!","August 11, 2018",0.0,0.0

Once we got to the plains, we saw a small group of elephants immediately. Following that, there were two large herds to look at whilst they were grazing.

The elephants move around, so you might see them at Mineriya instead. The jeep ride is bumpy but the driver knew where the elephants were, at the lake and very used to the 50+ jeeps! so we were able to get very close and got some great photos. Best time to see them is around 3pm, so allow an hour before that to get to the lake. We saw a huge herd of around 100 elephants, some as young as a month old who very well protected by the older ones but were playful and chasing the birds. There were also water buffalo lying down in the lake to cool off and a huge variety of birds in the shallows. Definitely the highlight of the trip. As with many other lakes in Sri Lanka, it is an artificial lake, with the damn causing a fairly large reservoir which retains water even during the dry periods as now (July 2018). The national park covers all the area of the lake plus a sizeable margin around the edges.

This tour was “an extra”, to fill in a few hours of “free time” we had one afternoon. What an excellent suggestion as this turned out to be probably the best highlight of the trip. All of our group of 10 elected to do the tour and we met up with our safari guides and were transferred into 4WD’s. It was a bit of a trek to get to the National Park, taking about 40 minutes to get there. Once we arrived, the safari guide opened up the roof of the 4WD allowing us to stand and take in all the sights. We entered the park and had our eyes peeled in search of the elephants. We saw many birds, even a crocodile sunning itself on a rock but no elephants. There were traces of them (elephant poo), but no elephants. We drove around for about 30 minutes along the road through the forest and then we came out onto the open fields to a huge lake. We drove along the dirt tracks adjacent to the lake and turned a corner and WHAM…...straight into a heard of about 30 elephants roaming freely eating the grass and foilage. It was a sight we will always remember. There was a big bull, who when he saw us became a little spooked and began to charge at us. Our driver reversed up quickly and the bull backed off. He eventually moved and we were able to pass by. To cut a long story short, for the next 90 minutes or so, we drove around this part of the National Park seeing 5-6 herds totaling more than 100 elephants. We would just stop, turn the engine off and watch these huge majestic animals in the natural habitat. It was a great experience. There were many other tours doing this as well, with up 10 4WD’s parked at one or two locations. But the elephants didn’t seem to care at all…..in fact, they often roamed by within a few metres of the vehicles. If you get the opportunity, make sure you do this….you won’t be disappointed.","June 29, 2018",0.0,0.0

Thus, the Park authority provided us with a safari jeep from Minneriya on wards and damn it was downright fun! It took us about 45 mins. to travel to Kaudulla (off road-short cut) and the journey was all worth it. We chose the afternoon to visit the park (around 2 pm), which is the ideal time to see elephants by the lake,  and the queue was quite long at the ticket booth. (they could've added at least two counters!) Finally, when we got to the Kaudulla Lake, we were blown away by the number of elephants who leisurely roamed around! We couldn't count of course (were busy taking selfies with wild elephants,no big deal), yet I am sure there were about 250 of them! That was one fantastique sight! Loved every bit of it <3 **If your intention is to see only elephants, Kaudulla is the ideal place for it.

Some of them were even showering so we had the chance to get many pictures of the elephants in many positions while they were doing their normal activity. Some of the elephants were tuskers, and as far as we know we were lucky to meet them because it is not very often to meet tusker elephants in Kaudulla.

We arrived in Habanara by bus with our 3 children at about 2.30pm and a helpful tuk-tuk driver found us a cheap room then helped us find a jeep driver. We paid 21,000 LKR for a 3-hour jeep ride from town.  We left at 3.30pm and arrived at the perfect time to see about 80 elephants grassing and bathing.  We also watched as they walked between all the jeeps to get to the fresh grass on the other side of us.  Utterly spectacular! I know that some people have complained about all the jeeps, but there were a lot less here than at other parks that we considered.  We also know plenty of people who spent a lot of money at other parks and never saw Elephants at all.  So I think it's important to keep a perspective about the popularity of this park unless you have loads of money and can arrange a private tour somewhere else.","March 13, 2018",0.0,0.0

Since it's a national park, i expected that they would care more for the animals and have a maximum for have many jeeps they allow to drive in. There was a lot of elephants, but even more jeeps. The jeeps sorrounded the elephants, keeping them caught in the middle of loud tourists and cars that never turned off the engine. They looked scared, horrified. Some were even separated by the jeeps and was left outside away from their herd. Most of the way we had to wait in line with probably more than fifty other jeeps to get further. I can't understand how this place is so highly recommended, and am so dissapointed in myself for falling for it. I truly regret it, and hope I can change others opinion. Skip it! The park isn't that beautiful either. It was just very expensive and dissapointing. Take a trip on Sigiriya rock instead. That's beautiful.","February 12, 2018",0.0,0.0

Didn't see that much else, but there are some good birds there, even for the casual twitcher (big eagles, brightly coloured bee-eaters, etc). Downside? Absolutely wacky races. I jest not, at one point we saw 60+ elephants in a group, and there were 30+ jeeps in a group watching them, jostling for position. The good news is that the wildlife ignored us completely, but it feels ""odd"" to me. The only safari I've done before was in Tanzania which was empty of other vehicles. All the drivers want their clients to have the best photo (= bigger tip for them), which doesn't help. If you can ignore this, it's good fun.

We deliberated long and hard about whether we should go as, although we love to see wildlife (especially elephants) we didn't want to contribute to the animals' disturbance or anxiety as other reviewers suggested can happen. We didn't want to be in a large convoy of jeeps either. In the end we thought we'd give it a go. The jeep safari was arranged by our accommodation host who hired us a jeep and driver for just the 2 of us. On arrival a guide joined us that we hadn't ordered but we went with it anyway. He said he was a volunteer but I doubt that. To be fair the park guide (who joined us in the back of the jeep) was well informed and pointed out stuff that we probably wouldn't have seen on our own - he ""controlled"" the driver, telling him when to stop. We set off at about 1pm and for the first couple of hours didn't see anyone else as we drove the tracks spotting various birds, a couple of crocs, a turtle, land monitor and thoroughly enjoyed the drive. Occasionally we came across a lone elephant which was nice. The guide seemed to be very apologetic that we hadn't found hundreds of elephants. There is a definite sense that they think the size of their tip is commensurate with the number of elephants spotted. This is a real problem. Later in the afternoon jeeps seemed to gather together and then it happened - a group of about 30 elephants emerged. This caused a frenzy as EVERYONE raced towards them and then jostled for position effectively corralling them on the patch of grass they were eating. The jeeps virtually encircled them and whilst the elephants didn't seem too concerned, it was an unnecessary encroachment. This behaviour would not be allowed in Etosha National Park in Namibia or Chobe in Botswana where we saw lots of elephants but at a safe and unintrusive distance. When elephants are spotted there is no control at all: no minimum distance, no path to keep to, just a free for all. Not good. They must do something to sort this out or eventually it will ruin everything. Sadly, I think someone will have to be killed or seriously injured before they do anything about it. We enjoyed the day, loved the scenery, saw lots, and gave a generous tip. Our low score reflects our displeasure at the lack of controls in terms of visitor numbers and behaviour, and lack of respect for the elephants. Hopefully, if we all score it lower because of this, they eventually may do something to protect the treasures that they have in this park.","January 19, 2018",0.0,0.0

The National Park should, in my opinion, control the access to the park somehow. For example only full jeeps could be allowed. We've seen many cars with just 2 people.

Do ask around at Habarana which of the nearby national parks will provide the best opportunity to see elephants. One requires a jeep to travel in the parks. We were lucky to stumble upon Amal who works from Hotel Prasanna, a modest hotel/restaurant located pretty close to the exit to Habarana Lodge/Village. Amal was very patient, pleasant, speaks excellent English and German, and very knowledgeable about the park and Sri Lanka in general. He pointed out plenty of wildlife including monkeys, birds, squirrels, and even a hornet's nest on our way and in the park, which we otherwise would have missed. While ""The Gathering"" had about 200 elephants and prolly 30 jeep loads of tourists, thankfully there is plenty of space and all what the jeeps need to do is park near this large herd(s) and do not have to chase the elephants. So didn't feel the jeeps took away any from the experience. The elephants themselves were supremely oblivious to the parked jeeps. We did see a smaller herd separate of The Gathering. The Gathering is a must see when in Sri Lanka. Believe the best time is during the dry season, July to October. Ask around for jeep rates.

Our driver Jaya also came along, which was handy a he could translate and inform the jeep driver any requests we had. There's 3 local national parks that the heards of elephants roam freely between, so it's handy having a driver who knows where the main heards are on any particular day. Entry into the park was around 3000 rupee  (£15) each, I paid at the entrance for two n jeep. The experience was magical, dozens of elephants with calfs roaming around close up to us.

There wasn't much else to see in the park, but we did spot an eagle on our way back out, and the landscape was very beautiful. My main tip would be to have a check of the reviews for Kaudulla and Menneriya the day of/before your trip and ensure that people have been reporting sightings before you travel. Most companies seem flexible and will take you wherever you ask. I would definitely book directly rather than through a hotel as this will save you a lot of money (we did ours for $10 each including tips, plus a small bus fare to Habarana, while the hotel charged $30 each).

I knew before that this was one of the 'popular' parks, but apparently much less busy that Yala (which I do not see how it is possible that Yala be busier than KAdulla was when we went).  We went at about 3pm which is when the elephants start gathering near the water.  We were one of the first jeeps to get there, racing across the park.  However, as we approached the elephants, we could see more and more jeeps approaching from every direction. It was amazing to see the elephants, we were so close to them, but I am not sure how much I fully enjoyed it because of the amount of jeeps.  I counted about 80 jeeps and as many elephants.  We then passed even more jeeps as we left the park. Some jeeps also got very close to the elephants, and other jeeps were blocking the elephants path, which meant the elephants were unable to reach their family on the other side.  some of the elephants were very clearly distressed by being separated by a line of jeeps. I recognise that having the elephants in a national park and being watched by jeeps at least means they are safer from poachers, but it was still a bit difficult to see.  However, if you are desperate to see elephants, you will not be disappointed. I recommend asking a local guide before hand whether to visit Minnerya or Kadulla because the elephants move back and forth between the two - you do not want to go to the wrong one!","September 19, 2017",0.0,0.0

The safari trucks stuck to the trails and the only close encounters we had with the elephants were when they would cross the trails on their own accord. Most of the elephants we saw were a bit far away but were astonishing. The herds had many baby elephants and we got to watch them playing and bathing in the mud. Also saw water buffalo and crocodiles in the river on the way into the park.,"September 17, 2017",0.0,0.0

The touristic part - quite expensive at 12000 LKR for a private safari with pickup. Where ""private"" means alone in a jeep, but you will be surrounded by 99 others. Its a bumpy 30 minute ride to the main plain filled with exhaust fumes and sweaty tourists. Obviously, these are the downsides. If you can shield out the chaos, you will be rewarded with the amazing part: We saw about 250 elephants trek from the jungle down to the waters between 4-6pm. It was absolutely majestic and filled me with a sense of calm as these giant animals made their way slowly through the grass while grazing. You will see Elephants of all sizes including babies. We also enjoyed their banter and playful wrestling between the adolescents. There are also moments of excitement when large males seem to disagree with the amount of vehicles that surround them and start walking towards jeeps. Luckily all drivers put safety first and made way for the animals. Besides elephants there's not too much else to see in terms of wildlife. We saw a massive beehive and 4 peacocks, but don't expect much more. All in all I would recommend this safari to others and return again myself! If you are doing this from Polonnaruwa, expect a 1 hour drive to the entrance of the park.","September 17, 2017",0.0,0.0

There were 4 of us and the price was LKR4000 per person, which included the entrance fee to the park. We didn't choose this park specifically, but this was where the elephants were currently hanging out so... The guide, driver and vehicle were all great. The guide knew lots of information, and stopped to point out various animals as we trundled through the overgrown forest area on our way to the tank. Sadly we didn't see any sloth bears- wrong time of day. The park is beautiful, and we were lucky enough to witness The Gathering, where over 200 elephants gather at one time. Some of the baby elephants we saw were only 3 months old. All of this was great. The only negatives were the quantity of tourist jeeps in the park at the same time- there must have been 20+ in there and more coming all the time. Most of them had only 2 people in 4-6 person jeeps, and no effort had been made to reduce the number of jeeps by combining tour groups. Obviously they were all looking for elephants, so the jeeps were all zooming around the same bit of park, making it noisy and congested. It seems there are no established tracks, and the jeeps can drive wherever they want. The second negative was, when they found elephants many would drive straight into the middle of a group, so close you could almost lean out and touch them. The jeeps would often leave there engines on, and would all bunch up together with no clear exit strategy should the elephants become agitated and charge, which we saw them do on at least 4 occasions that afternoon. Not only did this seem really cruel and intrusive to these groups of elephants, many of whom had young with them, but it was incredibly dangerous! When an elephant charges at a group of jeeps it it pretty terrifying! We were very firm with our guide, requesting to stay a good distance from the animals and to calmly watch them, explaining that if they wanted to come near us then fine, but we didn't want to invade their space, however given the antics of the other drivers I'm amazed that there has not been a serious accident yet. I have never been on safari in Africa, but I'm pretty sure this sort of behaviour would not be tolerated. So, in summary, the park was beautiful, the elephants a delight, and the humans were reckless, insensitive and dangerous. Not much of a surprise really.","September 17, 2017",0.0,0.0

The jeep was very uncomfortable and had an obstructed view right at eye level. The jeep driver also didn’t speak English, so we missed out on any type of commentary on what we were seeing, It’s a shame too because we saw a huge heard of elephants at the watering hole and would have loved to hear more about what was happening. The jeep also broke down as we were leaving and the jeep driver’s son had to pick us up in the middle of the park and take us back. Sadly we don’t know the actual name of that company to review, but our advice is to definitely do your research on the jeep and driver you’re getting here. With that said, our experience at Kaudulla was good in the sense that we could see a bunch of elephants, however maybe 100 or so jeeps surrounded the heard of elephants at one time, which felt sad and unnatural. Also the jeeps didn’t turn of their engines for us to hear the wild life, so it all felt very contrived and honestly angering. All in all we are grateful we had the experience at Kaudulla because we only saw two elephants at Yala National Park from a distance.

Our safari cost around 4,500 rupees per person (including park fees). When arranging our tour, we were advised that the elephant gathering had moved on from Minneriya National Park (which is also the advice given on the Minneriya website), so a tour to Kaudulla is, at the time of writing, the best way to see wild elephants en masse in this part of Sri Lanka. Our pick up was around 130pm in Polonnaruwa, getting to Kaudulla an hour later and entering the park around 245pm. We left around 5pm. During our visit, we saw maybe in the region of 80 to 100 elephants in different herd sizes scattered throughout the park. The largest group was around 40 to 50 elephants, with many small calves, mothers and younger males. There was an impressive tusked male wandering around as well. Given that this gathering of elephants is so very seasonal, you can obviously expect there to be interest from tourists and locals, so there are always likely to be quite a number of jeeps that follow the trails.  Perhaps some people have a romantic notion of seeing nature in the wild all to themselves, but that's not usually how things work for the price you pay here. If you want exclusivity, you will eventually have to pay a price for that. We did not think the overall experience was as bad as some reviews have portrayed. Most drivers we witnessed appeared to be very respectful and experienced, especially when elephants cross the trails. We did not see any drivers chase the herds off road and they all keep to the tracks, turning engines off when there were elephants nearby and only restarting them when elephants approached closer. The elephants seemed well used to the activity around them and, while that may not seem to be wild nature in the truest sense, the herds and individuals seemed happy enough to wander off in the the opposite direction away from the tracks if they felt the need to do so. Perhaps its a few bad tour drivers that spoil it for others on some days, but given the numbers of elephants moving into the park, there doesn't seem to be any need to chase for a photo opportunity at the moment. It's really a privilege to see these wonderful, beautiful creatures in such great numbers in the wild.  It's a once in a lifetime opportunity for many and a great experience.","August 26, 2017",0.0,0.0

On the way we saw a few birds, an enormous crocodile and some monkeys. When we arrived at the open plain, the sight of the large herd of elephants was amazing. More and more groups began to join and we ended up seeing dozens. The number of jeeps was evident as well and although the jeep we hired added to this, it wasn't the intimate experience I had imagined (But maybe that's my fault for not being realistic). To be fair, there was plenty of space in the park and we were lucky enough to get fairly close to different groups of elephants as they emerged from the forest. It was an unforgettable experience and I suppose the park reaps the benefits in terms of income, so maybe I've been a little bit critical. Seeing elephants cross the main road right in front of us on the way home was pretty cool too!","August 18, 2017",0.0,0.0

We were very fortunate to see about 100 elephants during our visit but had serious concerns about the lack of respect from the 4x4 drivers who showed zero respect for these endangered animals. At one stage we stopped by a dry shallow ravine to watch a large (+60) elephants grazing on the opposite side. We were quickly joined by over 50 jeeps and then one of the drivers decided to venture to the other side, therefore splitting the herd in two. This jeep was quickly followed by the majority of the jeeps resulting in a stressed group of elephants. A large male was patrolling the edge of the herd and was obviously distressed. This presented a serious safety issue for the people nearest the front as the proximity of the jeeps was too close to these large animals.

The jeep driver was knowledgeable and fairly careful in his driving.  The park was not very crowded compared to Yala NP standards. Basic facilities at the entrance was acceptable though the park management could do a better job at beautifying the entry and visitor information areas. The park seemed well maintained with good tracks. However, the best thing about the park are the elephants including many baby elephants. Kaudulla is one of the best places to see elephants and even get the experience of being chased by one!! Our jeep and a few others were chased by a bull elephant. Of course this is not a major safety concern and happens often at the park, Jeep drivers know their driving and usually gets the jeep out of the harms way. If you are visiting Sri Lanka and love elephants, Kaudulla National Park is a must visit. There are many other historical attractions nearby such as Sigiriya rock fortress, Dambulla rock temple, Minneriya National Park and close to excellent hotels at Kandalama near Dambulla and Sigiriya.","April 19, 2017",0.0,0.0

Our Driver Sarath was a wnder ful guide and took us through the tracks where we could see monitors, monkeys and different birds before we came on an expanding grassland leading to a huge lake. Here we saw quite a good number of birds including egrets and pelicans. Peacocks are of course in abundance like any other place in India and sri Lanka. Once we take a turn around the lake we came across the first elephant. it was a huge tusker and  was alone. So, the driver didn't go too close and we saw it from a distance of about 300 mt. within next half an hour we saw some more elephants and they were in small herds of 8-10. After that we came across our prized catch for the day - a herd of about 40-50 elephants including at least 5 baby elephants. And at that very moment it started raining heavily. Seating inside the jeep and watching those gentle giants playing in the rain was an unforgettable experience. About 10 jeeps dared to wait there in that torrential rain and observe the herd for around 15 minutes. After that driving out of that grassland in the rain was another experience for which the entire credit goes to Sarath who also helped another driver to pull off his jeep from mud on our way back.

So very close distance observation was possible still being safe. An amazing day!!!!","February 22, 2017",0.0,0.0

We saw one family and a couple of individual males. There were also painted storks, peacocks, other birds, and water buffalo.  The setting is very pretty as well.  We had some excitement when our driver decided to rescue another jeep that got itself stuck in the mud/water.  It took a team effort but they finally prevailed.  No one left behind!","February 19, 2017",0.0,0.0
