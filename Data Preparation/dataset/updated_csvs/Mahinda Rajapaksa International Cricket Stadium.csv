We were all sad to see the absolute waste in public property. The stadium is closed we could enter through a side gate. Although the stadium is built to play international cricket it has not being used for almost two years. Light bulbs are removed from the sockets; taps are removed from wash basins. The whole stadium is taken over by pigeons who have left their mark on all the chairs. The place is stinking and decaying, it will take a very long time to bring it back to standard to play an international game of cricket. Then again what for the Stadium is located in the bush. It may not be possible to find hundred spectators to come to watch a match from nearby. Why should people from Colombo travel all that way to watch a match? There was a match being played on the Sunday we visited the place. I was not surprised that there was no one to watch it. We understood that the facility is being looked after by an armed force unit. To their credit the ground is kept well. Actually, this a place that one should visit to understand what a colossal waste this whole thing is.","July 21, 2016",0.0,0.0
