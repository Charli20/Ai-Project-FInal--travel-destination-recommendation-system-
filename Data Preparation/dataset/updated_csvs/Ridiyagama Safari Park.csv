The animals are kept very well and have lots of space. We asked for our same guide again and Sudesh did a great job giving us information, animal names, and suggestions for feeding the elephants. Note…. Gandhi the elephant really likes biscotti biscuits! The lions were our favorites and the roaring was way more powerful than we expected. Baby monkeys, two week old donkey, hippos, and fierce hyenas were some animals we enjoyed. Would definitely recommend this safari if you are staying in the area.

Asking USD 15 and then not giving out any park map, and not having any signs with animal names at each of the blocks with e.g. ostrichs, is a huge letdown. Let alone asking you to pay extra to enter the kiddies farm area, or to see the feeding closeby! Also this part of the park is incomplete, with far more benches than meadows with animals. The safari area (Rs 300 pp extra for a, non-AC, bus seat or Rs 5000 for a jeep for max 6 persons) fares much better. Tiger area, lion area, Asian herbivores (also many not present in Sri Lanka) and African herbivores are nice to see especially for kids or for local adults that have not seen this abroad.","April 8, 2025",0.0,0.0

The park offers a well-organized safari that takes you through various zones, each representing different habitats and a diverse range of animals. The thrill of seeing elephants, lions, and other wildlife in a more natural setting was truly remarkable. The park itself is well-maintained, with clean facilities and clear signage that enhances the overall experience. The safari vehicle was comfortable, and our guide was knowledgeable, providing interesting facts about the animals and the park’s conservation efforts. The animals appeared to be well-cared for, and it was fascinating to observe them in environments that mimic their natural habitats. One of the highlights of our trip was the close-up encounters with the animals, especially the majestic elephants and the powerful lions. It felt like a real adventure as we drove through the park, with each turn bringing new surprises. The park could benefit from better crowd management..Ridyagama Safari Park offers a fantastic experience for wildlife enthusiasts and families alike. It's an excellent opportunity to connect with nature and learn more about the animals in a safe and controlled environment. We left with great memories and a deeper appreciation for the wildlife conservation efforts in Sri Lanka. Highly recommended!","August 29, 2024",0.0,0.0

We (a group of adults and one child) went there around 10am - I'd recommend going as early as possible, because it was already terribly hot by that time (even for us locals living some 100km away). Safari vehicles are also limited in number it seems, another reason to go early. Have to buy an entrance ticket PLUS a ticket for the safari. for the latter, you have two options - bus (low cost, operated by the Zoo itself) or jeep (there is a separate stall to book a jeep). We took the bus and was lucky to get seats at the front. The buses are specially prepared for the safari with iron bars fitted across the windows for added safety. There was a Zoo guide in the bus doing an excellent commentary - the problem was that it was only in Sinhala language. The bus took us through four zones that are available for viewing - African Lions, Herbivores, Tigers and Elephants. In each zone we saw plenty of animals. Such a wonderful experience to see animals roaming free, and see them at close range too. At the end, the bus stops at the small animal zone, where those who wish to do so can get down and go for additional activities (which we did) while others can return in the bus to where the bus ride started. These activities included feeding an elephant, feeding birds, petting animals and fish spa - all of which cost extra - but very reasonably priced. We spent around 4 hours there and had a great time. A must-do activity in Hambantota region.","April 17, 2023",0.0,0.0

Have to admire the concept here. Having visited  Dehiwala zoo many times and seeing how animals are cruelly caged there this is some kind of a relief to see animals roam freely. You are actually caged here in the vehicle till exit point. Currently there are 4 sections operating and plans are there to extend to 7 sections. African lions, Bengali tigers, herbivores and elephants are the sections operating as of now. You need to buy a ticket for 350 rupees and they will take you through the park in an air conditioned bus. Around 30 people can be accommodated per a bus. Only 2 buses were operating at the time we visited and roughly 30mins waiting time was there per a bus. But if there’s a large crowd the waiting time climbs up. They call in the order of ticket numbers so there’s no hassle to run for the bus. Total tour takes around 1 hour. During busy days they allow private vehicles like vans and buses to park with their guides to avoid the rush for park buses. In addition there’s a safari Jeep service also for which you have to pay around 2000 per a Jeep which could carry 5 6 people.

Currently only a part is open to visitors but it seem that the rest of the park is been set up so that the entire 500 acres of land will be available to spot the animals hailing from different parts of the world. Heard that one area will have Australian native wildlife too! When comparing with other commercial safari parks I have seen so far ""Ridiyagama Safari Park"" seem to be very much better.  Hope that the park will add Giraffe, Rhinos, Tapirs, Tigers, Jaguars, Leopards etc. etc. to make the experience better.

When you do get through on a jam packed bus again unless you understand fluent sinhala you are not able to understand anything. The enviroment they have the animals in is more like overgrown weeds non maintained land than trying to cater for the animals natural enviroment. The only animals tgat seemed to be at home were the elephants and even then one was rocking on the spot because it was chained to the one place. Oh and make sure you eat before you go! As you are safer only consuming packed chips than the fly blown non temperature controlled food in the poor excuse for a ""food court"" as they lable it. Also think about limiting your liquids or packing your own toilet paper as there is not even toilet roll holders for their to be toilet paper. Witnessed cleaners just spraying the whole toilet down with the bidet and mopping everything over with the same mop.

I haven't seen such stupid bill board positioning any where. Please be careful if you are using  google maps.It will most probably will give you some by roads only god knows where it heads. If you are going via Sooriyawewa, you have to go to town and make a right.Then make another left after 5-6 km on the road. Notice that the directions to hot water springs will guide you there. (Stupid bill boards can only be seen once you make the right turns) Park Park is still under construction. It was bit crowded as it was a weekend. Tickets were priced Rs.300 for locals. All has to wait for 25 seater bus to see the zoo(they have 7 buses now) We had to wait around 1.5 hours to get to a bus. There were 3 zones.Lions,wild animals and elephants. It was very hot and sunny and not a good time for too see animals.Go in early morning or in evening.But still good to see animals roaming freely than in a typical zoo. In the elephant park one cub came and cuddled with the bus.It was nice experience for all of us. Concerns 1.There's still only a one place you can get lunch.But only sub standard fried rice. So better to take your lunch there. 2.There were 2 drunken buggers were in our bus.It was a very hard time and unless for the patience for our guide the trip would have been a waste. So authories should look into these type of things seriously. In a summry there is no other zoo in the country to see animals roam freely. It will be a good experience to all.","August 21, 2016",0.0,0.0

We boarded an AC bus which took us around to see the animals. There are 3 zones operating in the park currently and we saw Lions, Zebras, Ostrich, Deer, African Cape Buffalos, Elephants, Giraffes, Bactrian Camels, Arabian Orix, Lechwe and Indian Blue Bulls walking freely in their zones. The tour took us one hour and the tour guide was excellent. The guide explained very well, in detail, in Sinhalese. Although our group could understand what was said, there was a another group of people in the bus and I think they were foreigners from a neighbouring country, and couldn't have understood what was explained. The children and elderly in our group also enjoyed.","August 7, 2016",0.0,0.0

First one has about 4 lions at the moment, and the second have the highest number and lot of varieties.. At the moment there's 5 Sri Lankan elephants but they are planing to increase to 15.. The animals seems to be in a lively mood than in the Zoo, and interesting to see them in a free area than in a cage.. My wife and kids enjoyed the whole tour but for me it was not that much entertaining like going on a wild life tour.. That's why I have mentioned it depends on your preference...","August 4, 2016",0.0,0.0

Currently three zones are opened for public. You can see lions, African animals and elephants etc This will be great location once it's fully completed in upcoming years.
