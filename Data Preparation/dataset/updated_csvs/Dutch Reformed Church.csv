Closed both evening and afternoon...,4,Family,"In fact, the name of this oldest church Halle, as in most Dutch cities, is still Groote Kerk=- Big Church. It may not be too big by Dutch standards. But there's less money in the colonies and less flock. Groote Kerk was built in 1755 on the site of a Portuguese Capuchin monastery. The foundations were laid 70 years earlier at the highest point in Halle, 12 metres above sea level. Centuries later, the high location and walls of the fort saved the church from the devastating tsunami of 2004. Interestingly, the freestanding bell tower is older than the church itself, as it was built in 1701 and was given to it by its predecessor church.  Unlike the Anglican -All Saints church, Groote Kerk did not get us. It was closed on both visits to Halle. Evening and afternoon. I suspect this is her permanent state...","November 21, 2025",0.0,0.0

I suppose you remember that in 1589 it was the descendants of the subjects of Henry the Navigator (Henrique o Navegador) who built the first fortification in Galle - the fortress of Santa Cruz Fortaleza (with earthen ramparts, bastions and wooden fortifications). However, in March 1640, an expeditionary force under the command of Commodore Willem Jacobson Coster, after a fierce battle, took the fort by storm and Halle became Dutch for many years. The warriors of the “land of tulips,” taught by the sad experience of the Portuguese, by 1663 erected a monumental granite fort in Galle. The latter is included in the UNESCO heritage list as the largest surviving fort in Asia built by Europeans. In doing so, the Dutch incorporated the Portuguese north wall into a large rampart. The first (so-called old) gate to the fort was located next to the harbour. They are still there, marked with a heraldic bas-relief and the numbers “1668” (as I understand, the year they - the gate - were erected). And not far from these very oude poort in 1775, the Groote Kerk (aka Dutch Reformed Church, also known as the Dutch Reformed Church) was built - one of the oldest Protestant churches in Ceylon. According to researchers, this temple was erected on the site of an earlier Portuguese monastery, Ordo Fratrum Minorum Capuccinorum (however, I did not find any reliable data about the latter, so I treat this information with great doubt). I am not good at the architecture of Dutch churches specifically from the period of colonial rule in Ceylon, but I can say that all the religious buildings of the Dutch (and, according to my calculations, there seem to be only five of them left on the island) are not similar to the various churches of Catholicism that I have previously seen, Orthodoxy and Protestantism. Not to mention other, less numerous “branches” of the Christian faith. And all the Dutch churches of Ceylon: Groote Kerk in Galle, Wolvendaalse Kerk in Colombo, St Peter's Kerk in Kalpitiya, Nederlands Hervormde kerk in Matara Fort, Kruys Kerk in Jaffna Fort - they are different and, at the same time, somewhat similar. The current Dutch temple in Halle was built with the care of the fort commander Casparus de Jong and his wife Geertruida Adriana Le Grand. In 1755, the latter happily gave birth to a long-awaited child (a girl) and, as a sign of gratitude to the Almighty for such a gift, Lord and Lady Spanbrook sponsored the construction of a temple on the territory of Fort Galle. Yes, to make it clear: the current church is definitely not the first Christian temple in the fort: the Dutch knocked the Portuguese out of the fortress in 1640 and, being zealous Christians, could not live without the sacred. Therefore, I agree with the opinion of researchers that the first Dutch temple appeared in Halle in the middle of the 17th century (it is documented that baptisms were already carried out in the Gallic church in 1678). As for the current Groote Kerk, we know exactly when this temple “began working.” And all thanks to the daughter of Commander de Jonga: by decision of the parents, their daughter was not baptized until the church was built. And the corresponding entry in the church book indicates the date of the baby’s baptism - August 24, 1755!!! A couple of “strokes” for the architecture of the sacral. In its spatial-volumetric composition it is close to Kolombov's Wolvendaalse Kerk; it has the same cruciform shape, only its transepts are much shorter. Retaining the weight of the floor was achieved through the original use of the structure of two large Dutch gables on the north and south sides. The pediments are originally decorated with pilasters, cornices, fancy stucco moldings, including volute-shaped, spiral shapes, and are completed with three finials resembling torches. The Groote Kerk in Fort Galle is a most interesting historical and architectural site. Highly recommend!!!","March 18, 2024",0.0,0.0

We really liked the architecture of this church and it is well worth a short visit, if only to see the tombs and feel the peaceful atmosphere.

Worth a quick visit while walking around Galle Fort area. Located in an historical place the beautiful old church contain so much history! Incredibly preserved Church from the Dutch era it is right out of a Vermeer and you shouldn't miss seeing it. This was quite an interesting church.

While walking around the Fort in Galle, we came across this Church, it was just down the road, on Church Street from the bigger and taller Church, All Saints Anglican, currently being refurbished. Despite being the smaller of the 2 Churches it had its own grace and charm outside. However the interior of the Church was rather minimalistic with the main features being a large stained glass window and the back of the Church, very high wooden ceiling painted blue and the gravestones on the floor. There is a wooden pulpit a small organ and at the back of the Church is a balcony. A person at the church informed us that the stained glass window was installed in 1830 by the British. The church was built in 1755 by the Dutch and is the second largest Protestant Church in the Country after the one in Colombo. It is still is use for worship. The Church survived unscathed during the Tsunami of 2004. Steeped in history well worth a walk around the Church and grounds.

Thanks to the position of church on high ground (cca 12 m above the see) and massive walls of the Galle fortress there was no damage to the church during tsunami 2004.

It has the architecture typical of a large colonial church and is open to the public, the entrance being obvious and located on Church Street facing the rampart, though the belfry is curiously detached and stands across the road. The building you can see today was erected in the 1750s and as you enter you will notice the rows of seats, the gravestones on the floor and the organ up to the left. The organ was installed a little later in 1760 (there is a smaller 20th century organ) and on the far side of the rail separating it from the rest of the church interior there was a visitors book and a box for donations. When we called in visitors were being politely asked to make a donation for the running of the church but there was no pressure to do so and no suggested amount. It's nice to think if you can drop a few rupees at least into the box that you are helping both the local community through helping with the upkeep of the church and also doing a little to protect and maintain one of Galle Forts visitor attractions. It's also worth taking a few moments to notice the pulpit rather than just walk by. This was made with some pride by a craftsman using Calamander wood brought all the way from Malaysia. The stained glass window on the West side (the rampart is to the East) is a rather later addition, dating from 1830 The main feature of the church though lies mainly beneath your feet. Wander around taking in some of the many gravestones most of which were apparently originally in the Dutch cemetery before being removed to the church for their protection. There are memorials at various points around the walls too that are worthy of note and in some cases it's revealing to note the cause of death where mentioned and the ages of those who were interred. Sri Lanka may now be a holiday destination but for the Dutch colonists it seems to have been an unforgiving environment that frequently brought disease, sickness and a shortened life. We were told the oldest of the gravestones dates from 1662 but because of language differences we could ask little more. A number of the gravestones were also covered by chairs so it wasn't possible to view those towards the centre especially. There is a memorial on the wall near the pulpit to the De Ly family that produced one of the last Dutch governors of Galle, Andreas de Ly. As the last of his line he apparently stipulated in his will that his family coat of arms should be carried to his funeral and destroyed. There was no objection to the taking of photographs and lighting, especially for a digital camera was adequate so also respecting the fact that this is a place of prayer for many I did not use a flash. The Church was open between the hours of 9am and 5pm when we visited it in April 2015. Unless you have a specific interest in the church or its architecture or want to spend some time looking around the various gravestones a visit of 20 minutes or so should be enough to take in a little of the atmosphere and main features. If you are close by it is worth stopping in to see it if only because it gives a little insight into the Dutch colonists who gave Galle Fort so much of its character in terms of the wall, buildings and general layout and something of the British who followed them; a number of memorials recording the end of those who had also served in India or were making their way home. It is also very much on the route if you are following the line of the rampart on a walk. I hope you enjoy it.","June 14, 2015",0.0,0.0

It was built at the highest point in Galle by donations from a Dutch army officer as thanks giving for the birth of his daughter. Her tiny baptism dress and other items are on display on one of the walls within. The church floor is paved with grave stones and the walls outside are lined with memory stones.  The old organ is as old as the church! There is an elderly gentleman who is available on site to explain the history to visitors. He seemed to expect a ""tip"". I would think Rs.100 would suffice. On the side of the church is an underground passage which some say was used by the Governor during the war. This tunnel connects to his house which is diagonally across the road. Some say it leads to a Burial Chamber. The church is well preserved and deserves a casual visit, if not during the service.","November 17, 2012",0.0,0.0
