The climb itself is quite an adventure, with narrow pathways that make the journey exciting and memorable. Once at the top, the panoramic scenery is absolutely worth the effort and makes for stunning photos. However, be prepared for a crowd, especially near the final section of the climb. There was a significant wait to access the last part of the tower, and after some time in the sun, I chose not to continue. To enjoy the experience comfortably, I would recommend visiting early in the morning or during quieter hours. Overall, Ambuluwawa Tower is a must-see for travelers looking for an adventurous and scenic stop in Sri Lanka. It’s a one-of-a-kind attraction that combines culture, nature, and a little bit of thrill!","September 1, 2025",0.0,0.0

At first, the journey felt easy – just like life in the beginning, when many people walk with you. But as we climbed higher, the path became narrow and challenging. I noticed something beautiful and deep: the higher you go, the fewer people can walk with you. Near the top, only one person can go at a time, just like in life – your journey, your dreams, and your views are sometimes meant just for you. Reaching the top of Ambuluwawa, I saw a breathtaking 360-degree view of nature, mountains, clouds, and the peaceful surroundings. It felt like standing between the earth and sky. The wind, the silence, and the beauty touched my heart. It’s not just a tower – it’s a symbol of life, growth, and solitude.","June 12, 2025",0.0,0.0

We drove on a rustic Mitsubishi jeep. That was truly a ride to remember and enjoy! A hike, walk to Ambuluwawa Rock near Kandy is an exhilarating experience that combines natural beauty with a touch of adventure. Located about 25 kilometers from Kandy, Ambuluwawa is known for its unique biodiversity complex and the iconic Ambuluwawa Tower. The hike begins at the base of the Ambuluwawa Mountain, where you’ll start ascending through lush greenery and diverse plant life. The trail is moderately challenging, with a mix of steep sections and gentler slopes. As you climb higher, you’ll be rewarded with stunning panoramic views of the surrounding mountains, forests, and rivers. At the summit, the Ambuluwawa Tower stands tall, offering a 360-degree view of the landscape which is breathtaking. The tower itself is a marvel, with a spiral staircase that narrows as you ascend, adding a bit of thrill to the climb. The top of the tower provides breathtaking views, making it a perfect spot for photography and simply soaking in the beauty of Sri Lanka. The entire hike, including the climb to the top of the tower, can take around 2-3 hours, depending on your pace. It’s advisable to start early in the morning to avoid the midday heat and to enjoy the serene atmosphere before the crowds arrive.","August 25, 2024",0.0,0.0

The climb of the tower starts inside and it is only when you are a third of the way up do you go outside. As you gradually make your way up the steps become narrower and the room to pass becomes more difficult, there are several little cubbyholes to assist with passing.

There has been an increased popularity in recent times especially due to the breathtaking views you can experience when you climb to the top of the Ambuluwawa Tower. It is also known for its narrow spiral staircase which some visitors find challenging to climb. It is one of the coolest places to visit in Sri Lanka if you are up for the challenge. Ambuluwawa Mountain Ambuluwawa mountain peak has a height of 3567 feet above sea level. It is located over 1000 feet above from the Gampola Town. The tower is located on the summit of the mountain peak. Since there are no other mountains in the surrounding area and due to its unique location, Ambuluwawa Tower gets an undisturbed view from far away and vice versa. The tower is visible from Gampola Train Station. The 48 meters tall, cone-shaped tower houses the Stupa (Pagoda) of the Buddhist Temple. As you climb up, it has several viewing platforms for you to enjoy the stunning views. The staircase gets narrower as you go up. The spiral staircase will be a challenging one to climb if you are not comfortable with heights. Ambuluwawa Biodiversity Complex is the first of its kind in Sri Lanka. It was opened in 2009. It is home to a variety of plants. It is considered as the fourth botanical garden in Sri Lanka. It is a multi-religious centre where followers of all faiths practiced in Sri Lanka come to practice their religion. It consists of a Buddhist Temple, Hindu Temple, a Church, and a Mosque. Nearest Town: Gampola You can travel by train to visit Ambuluwawa Tower. Gampola is the nearest train station. It is advisable to hire a tuk-tuk/taxi from Gampola if you are getting there by public transport. Gates open at 8.30 am. The distance from the entrance to the mountain peak is about 2.5 -3 km. You can take your car, hire a TUK TUK or walk to the top.","May 22, 2024",0.0,0.0

The view requires a steep climb and many stairs, but I have never been to the top. I am afraid of heights and also feel uneasy about the construction quality of the place. The souvenir shop sells handmade goods at an overpriced rate, which discourages many people from buying.

I am sad to say, but like many places in Sri Lanka this complex has no special spiritual feeling or atmosphere and is not well looked after. More effort has been made on the gift shop at the bottom of the tower than anything else from what I could tell. Don't believe all the hype on Instagram. Instagram always makes everything look amazing. As I said, the view is incredible, but the tower is dirty and there is rubbish all in the interior. I would not recommend this as a 'must see' place. I think there are spots in Ella where the view is equally beautiful. Disapointed.","March 5, 2024",0.0,0.0

Climbing it be prepared to negotiate an ever narrowing staircase with a concrete balustrade handrail with a few uprights missing here and there and some gaps in the treads clearly showing the fall to certain death below. Its not well maintained to be frank. The steps are so narrow at the top its impossible to pass meaning people constantly have to go back but even that is very difficult indeed. I'm not bad with heights but didnt really like it having people trying to get past and the view downwards is dizzying. Nice coffee bar and clean toilets at the bottom.","January 16, 2024",0.0,0.0

You can get to the tower from the lower parking lot by tuktuk (5 minutes). I don't recommend walking. It will take about 40 minutes uphill along the serpentine road. And then the same way down.

Apparently you won’t get all the way to the top, but 2/3 can be overcome. The views from the middle are amazing. I recommend it to everyone.","January 6, 2024",0.0,0.0

It was actually very scary and not in a good way. It would have been a Great place to visit if it were  managed  or developed a little better. The steps towards the top of the tower are so narrow that it’s impossible for two people to stand side by side at the same time. Even a single person can’t stand straight near the top of the tower. People have to squeeze past each other when walking up or down in opposite directions. At various instances some people simply has to fling their legs over the safety railing to allow opposite traffic to move past. Someone had to crouch down to the floor to let someone else jump over to cross into the opposite direction. The steps have been developed in a very narrow fashion and either the management needs to widen the steps or form groups that  move up at a particular time and only let the next group go up when the one before has returned. Sadly there is no supervision or any remote sense of management responsibility. We went up on Christmas-25th December and I agree that there would have been heavier than usual footfall due to the holiday but that’s no excuse to put safety of visitors at risk.

However, visitors should be cautious. The climb to the top can be quite dangerous due to low railings, narrow staircases, and overcrowding. Additionally, starting from January 1st, the entry fee for tourists will double to 2000 LKR, which is worth considering when planning a visit.
