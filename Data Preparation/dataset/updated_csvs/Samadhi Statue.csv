Now only this statue is only founs.  Bodhisattva tree also not found there now. This statue's nose was recreated because invaders destroyed the nose. This statue has interesting views.  When you are looking to the face it looks deep meditation. When you are looking from the left side of the face looks like Buddha is smiling or happy. When seen from the right side it looks like Buddha is sad or worried. It is a masterpiece. The master who carved this statue is a great master. Left half of the lips of the Lord Buddha, is little longer and right half of the lips little shorter. This statue also of very different style one. They are; happy sad and diddle moods of the face if you look at it from 3 sides. This Buddha is beautiful though not as large as the Gal Vihara  Buddhas at Polonnaruwa, but perfect and peaceful.

The tranquillity in the surroundings is miraculous! It might look like the Buddha statues that one might have seen anywhere else, but a close look will reveal much more. The smooth art of making an ordinary stone into an incarnation of Samadh , the ultimate peace is really visible here.  It is more to be seen as work of art with a meaning rather than just an attraction. The Buddha is depicted in the position of the Dhyana Mudra, the posture of meditation associated with his first Enlightenment.

This is a statue of Gautama Buddha in meditation posture or Dhyana Mudra made out of out of dolomite marble and stands 7 feet 3 inches (2.21 metres) in height and width. This belongs to the old Abhayagiri chapter teaching monastery which was built in the 89-77 BC. Old records of Faxian Buddhist monk from china mentioned that this Agayagiri monastary was a huge university at that age with four faculties. This is belongs to one of those faculty. Some of the historical archives give evidence that the king bought a Buddha statue from “Maha Vihara – great monastery located around the “Sri maha Bodhi” temple. So some archeologists clams that this is that statue. The first prime minister of India Javahallal Neru once visited this Buddha statue and said this place gives him inner peace. And he kept a photo graph of this statue also in his residence.,"December 4, 2015",0.0,0.0

When you gaze at the statue, a feeling of calmness and peace overcomes you. The expression on his  face is overpowering. The statue is now protected by a concrete hood which does take away some of the attraction of this most famous meditation statue of the World. The expression as seen by the observer is said to change depending on the angle from it is viewed. It is situated in a beautiful park and the whole atmosphere is one of serenity.
