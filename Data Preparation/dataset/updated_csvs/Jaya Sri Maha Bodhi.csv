The 500 metre walk from the designated car park was through well-kept pathways shaded by many other large trees.  Halfway to the bo tree, we reached a shoe counter where we left our shoes for safekeeping at no charge.  Continuing barefoot, we joined a stream of pilgrims, mostly dressed in white, carrying offerings of flowers and incense. The Sri Maha Bodhi is recognised as the oldest living human-planted tree in the world, having been planted in 288BC.  It originated from a cutting of the Bo tree in Bodh Gaya, India - the very tree under which Lord Buddha attained enlightenment.  The sapling was brought to Sri Lanka by Sanghamitta, a buddhist nun, and ceremoniously received by the king marking a significant moment in the island’s religious history. Over the centuries, the Sri Maha Bodhi has been continuously protected and cared for by Buddhist monks, devoted kings and now by the government.  It stands surrounded by golden railings on a high platform, serving as the spiritual heart of Anuradhapura.  For more than 2300 years, this sacred tree has been venerated by Buddhists from around the world, making it one of the most revered pilgrimage sites in Sri Lanka. Standing before the Sri Maha Bodhi, we felt a profound sense of connection to the pilgrims who had come here for centuries before us.  The experience was both humbling and inspiring – a reminder of faith and tradition.","December 3, 2025",0.0,0.0

In Buddhism, this tree has sacred meaning and is found in every monastery. The high status is due to the fact that it was under it that Gautama attained enlightenment in Bodh Gaya. However, that tree did not survive, but from its seed was grown a tree in Anuradhapura in the time of King Ashoka. It is pointless to argue over the sacred status of this tree, for it is the truth of faith, not the truth of reason. But the fact that this tree has the longest documented history in the world is highly probable. 2,300 years! What's more, the sprouts of this ficus have been taken to Buddhist monasteries all over the world! True, if you look closely, you'll see that the tree is not one, but several.

Just walking distance from Anuradhapura main train station.  This tree (sapling) was planted here in 249 BC and is known as the oldest surviving tree in the world which has a known date of plantation. It was brought here by Sangamitta, daughter of Emperor Ashoka of India with great pomp and show 2500 years ago.

Buddhists thronged the surrounds paying homage to this sacred bodhi tree.  Although surrounded by people, I felt happy and peaceful due to the tranquility prevailing around this great bodhi tree. According to History Indian emperor Asoka dispatched his daughter-nun Theri Sanghamitta to Lanka with a sapling of the sacred Bodhi obtained from the main stem of the bodhi tree in Bodh Gaya where Buddha attained enlightenment.  In Sri Lanka, King Tissa received the sapling and planted it in his garden at the present site in 249 BC. This makes this tree 2266 years old (in 2016). This tree is  considered the oldest living tree in the world in the recorded history. People who live in the neighbourhood, whose ancestors received land for their services are still the guardians of the tree in addition to the buddhist priests.  This age-old custom of guarding continues to date. In 1985 the LTTE terrorists attacked these premises killing over 170 priests, men, women and children.  The tree escaped unharmed. Note:  Foreigners need a day ticket (Approx 16USD) from Department of Museums that allows them free access to all cultural sites in and around Anuradhapura.  No foot wear allowed within the premises.  Visitors are requested to be dressed in simple covered clothing appropriate for a religious location.

This was the start of our tour of the cultural triangle and it makes a great place to start. Our driver suggested a guide which we took for 2000r and it was well worth it to understand the symbolism and rituals s week as the history which you can get from any guidebook. Understanding the moon and guardstones for example set us up for appreciating all the other temples we saw and was a good starting point for our  kids aged 13 and 10. The site is super busy with tourists but also regular worshippers and that's what made it so interesting compared with other less busy temples.  Stay and watch the processions and you will learn about local/religious customs. On a practical note as it's so hot and you need to remove your shoes, kids (and sometimes adults) can wear socks so bring a pair with.

We arrived at 9:05am and only had until 3:30pm ,all other drivers only offered to drive us to each site. He took us around like we were family and explained his culture and the Buddhist religion, history and meanings behind every single detail at each location. He made us feel safe, welcomed and very comfortable. As we only had a short time we needed a place to store our bags so he called his shop owner friends and organized everything for us. Here comes the crescendo, he wanted to do it all for only $15 AUD which is 1500 rupees . A FULL 6 hours of driving us:  to get food ,storing our bags and even including the prices for the attractions we viewed for well over half the going price of everyone else ( $40aud for a tour guide ) he knew EVERYTHING about each site, down to the year it was made, who made it the history and the stories behind everything, he cared about us learning his culture. We could not have asked for a better 6 hours in this beautiful ancient city. By the end of it my girlfriend and I were so happy with his service we gave him $30 AUD because how special he made the day, he WOULDN'T EVEN ACCEPT THE MONEY !! He asked us if we were students, we told him we weren't and that we had full time jobs just so he'd take the offer.

It is said to have grown from a cutting of the original tree under which the Buddha attained Enlightenment in India. The tree has been tended for 23 centuries and cuttings have been taken and planted in temples throughout the island. There is no entrance charge as far as we could tell but security here is tighter than at other attractions in Sri Lanka (a result of the bombings in 1998) and there separate lines for men and women. This is a sacred place so, as for all temples, you must dress respectfully (legs and shoulders covered).  You need to remove hats and shoes. You are allowed to keep socks on and I would recommend this as it is a bit of a walk to get to the tree at the centre of the complex. The site was very tranquil and it was interesting to visit for the history.  You need to bear in mind that you will not be able to get a close up view of the tree as it is enclosed by a wall and railings.  Only two branches of the original tree remain, and these are supported by props. This is the main reason we personally didn't feel able to score higher than a '3'.

On my seventh day in Sri Lanka,  I arrived at the Anuradhapura Railway station at 4.30am.  Earlier, on my sixth day in Sri Lanka,i.e. 13/11/2012, I had boarded a 4.30pm-train from Hatton railway station to Colombo Fort Raiway station. Upon reaching Colombo at 10pm, I hopped into the 10.30pm train to the north of Colombo and reached Anuradhapura, one of the ancient capitals of Sri Lanka which is famous for its well-preserved ruins of ancient Sri Lankan civilization, at 4.30am, i.e. after a 12-hours-train-journey from Hatton. Anuradhapura is one of the ancient capitals of Sri Lanka, world famous for its well preserved ruins of the Great Sri Lankan Civilization. The Civilization which was built upon this city was one of the greatest civilizations of Asia and in the world. The city is now a UNESCO heritage site.  Today this ancient city of Sri Lanka, which is sacred to the Buddhist world, and which its surrounding monasteries covers an area of over sixteen square miles ( 40 km²) and is one of the world's major archaeological sites. After a morning quick tour of the Ancient Ruins & Holy City of Anuradhapura, including Thuparamaya where the collarbone of Buddha is enshrined, Isurumuniya(a picturesque rock temple) and The Sacred Jaya Siri Maha Bodhi at Mahaviharaya/ Mahameghavana Park which is recorded as the oldest surviving historical tree in the world, I took a bus back to Colombo from Anuradhapura New Town at 1pm. The oldest surviving tree in the world, The Sacred Jaya Siri Maha Bodhi at Mahaviharaya/ Mahameghavana Park, Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka, is believed to have been propagated from the original Bodhi tree.  This original Bodhi Tree, also known as Bo (from the Sinhalese Bo), was a large and very old Sacred Fig tree (Ficus religiosa) located in Bodh Gaya (about 100 km (62 mi) from Patna in the Indian state of Bihar), under which Siddhartha Gautama, the spiritual teacher later known as Gautama Buddha, is said to have achieved enlightenment, or Bodhi.  According to Buddhist texts the Buddha, after his Enlightenment, spent a whole week in front of the tree, standing with unblinking eyes, gazing at it with gratitude.  The term ""Bodhi Tree"" is also widely applied to currently existing trees, including the Bodhi tree in Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka, which has a great significance in the history of Buddhism. This Bodhi tree in Anuradhapura is widely mentioned in Mahavamsa.  While not considered a canonical religious text, the Mahavamsa is an important text in Theravada Buddhism. It covers the early history of religion in Sri Lanka, beginning with the time of Siddhartha Gautama, the founder of Buddhism.  According to the Mahavamsa, the Sri Maha Bodhi in Sri Lanka was planted in 288 BC, making it the oldest verified specimen of any angiosperm. In this year (the twelfth year of King Asoka's reign) the right branch of the Bodhi tree was brought by Sanghamittā to Anurādhapura and placed by Devānāmpiyatissa his left foot in the Mahāmeghavana. The Buddha, on his death bed, had resolved five things, one being that the branch which should be taken to Ceylon should detach itself. From Gayā, the branch was taken to Pātaliputta, thence to Tāmalittī, where it was placed in a ship and taken to Jambukola, across the sea; finally it arrived at Anuradhapura, staying on the way at Tivakka. Those who assisted the king at the ceremony of the planting of the Tree were the nobles of Kājaragāma and of Candanagāma and of Tivakka.  According to the Mahavamsa, branches from the Bodhi trees of all the Buddhas born during this kalpa were planted in Ceylon (Sri Lanka) on the spot where the sacred Bodhi tree stands today in Anurādhapura. Later, after completing my visit to the other attractions of the Ancient Ruins & Holy City of Anuradhapura I took a bus back to Colombo from Anuradhapura New Town at 1pm and reached the Pettah bus station in Colombo at 8pm to put-up a night at a nearby low cost lodge, i.e. Classic Inn in Panchikawatte Road before leaving for the Bandaranaike Airport at 6am of 15/11 to catch the 12.55pm flight back to Malaysia.","January 3, 2013",0.0,0.0

Quite interesting to watch devotees chanting and walking around, making offerings of fruits, etc but the Sacred Bo tree was barely visible so just be aware of that.

It was a bit hassly.  Ok if you are a buddhist or are into temple-watching but not worth going out of your way to see otherwise.

The approach to the tree is around 200 meters and monks live in proximity to the Tree Complex. It is one of the holiest Buddhist shrines in the world.
