Our tickets had been purchased in advance. However, upon arrival, we realized that the tickets had been left behind. We approached the supervisor and explained the situation, but the lady supervisor was unwilling to listen. She repeatedly stated that we would not be allowed entry and instructed us to go home and bring the tickets if we wished to enter the premises. We requested that she escalate the matter if she was not in a position to make a decision, but she refused, saying she could neither escalate the issue nor provide the manager’s contact number. After several requests, we managed to get the manager on the line, though he was not on duty at the time. I explained the situation and asked him to verify our ticket purchases from the back end and make an exception. He insisted that he needed to see the original tickets before allowing entry. Fortunately, since we were from Colombo, we were able to return home, retrieve the tickets, and return to the park. After a long discussion, we were finally allowed in, but the incident had already spoiled the mood and the day. If we had been from outside Colombo, it would have been impossible to return the same day. It is a shame for such a lovely place. The management clearly needs proper training in handling customer inconveniences. The most disappointing part was that they never allowed us to fully explain our situation, repeatedly speaking over us. At one point, they even stated, “We are David Peiris,” as though the brand name alone justified their actions. Such an approach will only diminish the brand’s value over time. Once we entered, the park itself offered a pleasant atmosphere, friendly staff, great service, fantastic food, and excellent facilities. Unfortunately, these positives are overshadowed by poor management practices, which risk spoiling an otherwise wonderful experience.","August 13, 2025",0.0,0.0

As it was a Saturday, the venue was lively and bustling, which added to the energetic atmosphere. The reception staff were exceptionally friendly, with Marlon, in particular, going out of his way to assist us. The environment, including the public area and washrooms, was well-maintained, clean, and pleasant. It's evident that the management takes health and safety seriously, ensuring the well-being of their guests. However, I would like to share one piece of feedback. I was informed by the reception staff that I could top up and utilize services directly. During lunch, after waiting in line to place my order, I was told by the cashier that I did not have sufficient credit. This situation required me to return to the locker room to retrieve my wallet, rejoin the queue, and place the same order again, which was a bit disappointing.

Unfortunately, we did not have a great experience. It started off badly, when we got to gate to give our bags to be x-rayed and to be told we were not allowed to bring any bottles of drinking water into the park and that we had to purchase these inside, which was extremely annoying and very expensive to buy only the  small bottles of water available and having to ditch our water we had brought with us. When we got to the counter to pay for the tickets, there were 4 staff behind the counter but only one actually taking payments. There was 1 group in front of us, but after being ignored and about 6 other families being served before us, After 20 minutes we got out tickets, to be then informed that as tourists we were paying 20% more than anyone who had local ID or a bank card, with this price of £16 each were pretty comparable to UK park prices. On arrival into the park my daughter then entered the kids splash area to be told she was not allowed in that zone as she did not have the correct wristband on, but to our knowledge we had purchased all-area tickets. The rides themselves were good, but at this point we had a sour taste in our mouth and very poor customer service. I really got the impression that the park is no t at all geared towards international visitors or thier expectations, which I felt was also echoed by the fact we were the only western guests in the park the whole day. I would recommend you try a different waterpark, as I really wished we did.","August 8, 2024",0.0,0.0

The park was opened on time. Every employee was incredibly polite and attentive. The first activity we did was karting. We purchased a package for Rs. 7,800 that included SplashBay, SpeedBay, ArrowBay, and TargetBay. As my first experience at SpeedBay racing track, it was incredibly enjoyable and spectacular. Before attempting it, pay close attention to their directions. SplashBay, it was super thrilling specially that great escape 🤭I tried umpteen times. This was a first gravity drop slide in SL. Really enjoyed all the water rides. Next TargetBay, the best place to check your vision 😃. Specially, we should mention Mr. Pehesara from TargetBay. He was very welcoming and very helpful. He explained well all the safety precautions and shooting techniques. The ArrowBay female employee was pleasant and amazing. She was incredibly helpful, but I forgot to ask her name. TBH, I am not happy with Yumbay's services. We ordered pasta and Mongolian rice. The pasta was hot and tasty, but the rice was too cold and not fresh which was Rs. 1,200/- All equipments modern and well maintained amusement park 👍 Based on my experience, I can rate the zones as follows: *SpeedBay 4.5/5 *SplashBay 4.5/5 *TargetBay 4/5 *ArrowBay 4/5 *YumBay 2/5 It was literally nice spot to hang out with friends, family, and coworkers, as well as to plan birthday celebrations, sporting events, and business gatherings.

My family, consisting of nine individuals, including a disabled member, was subjected to distressing harassment by two employees named Kapila. This incident is beyond unacceptable. Throughout our time at the park, the Kapila employees displayed shocking behavior, using offensive language and an alarming attitude. Their inhumane treatment towards our disabled family member and the entire group is utterly distressing. We were treated as less than human, akin to animals. We have attached video evidence that clearly captures the degrading behavior exhibited by these employees. It is vital that PearlBay management takes immediate and rigorous action to address this situation. We demand: 1. A thorough investigation into the conduct of Kapila employees. 2. A public apology issued to our family for the humiliation and distress caused. 3. Compulsory sensitivity training for all staff members. 4. Assurance that no visitor, irrespective of their situation, experiences such maltreatment. We await a swift response and appropriate resolution to this grievous matter. Failure to address this incident adequately will leave us with no choice but to escalate this concern further.","August 10, 2023",0.0,0.0

One major issue is that the park doesn't offer free lockers, and instead has a dedicated person asking customers if we need them. This can be frustrating for customers, especially if they weren't aware of the additional cost beforehand. Additionally, the suggestion to change at your car and leave your belongings in there is not practical and can be inconvenient. Another issue is the park's ride policy, as they don't allow customers to ride alone(They asked two people which I didn't have 😕). It would be helpful if the park made this policy clear before customers purchase their tickets so they can plan accordingly. Despite these issues, Pearl Bay Water Park still offers a great range of attractions and facilities for those willing to pay for them. The park is well-maintained and staff are friendly and helpful. However, the management should consider the feedback of their customers and make improvements accordingly to ensure a better experience for everyone.","April 29, 2023",0.0,0.0
