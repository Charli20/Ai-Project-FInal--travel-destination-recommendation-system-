Wonderful for watching birds in particular, I have never seen so many Brahmin harriers in the air and white-tailed eagles. Beautiful scenery and just wonderfully quiet. There are also elephants here, we have seen the tracks everywhere, unfortunately not them.","September 25, 2025",0.0,0.0

By which time it was too late for bird watching of those dawn birds. They had no one to issue tickets and the man who joined us as “Ranger” had no idea what the birds were let alone where to go to the best places to see them. We were told that even elephants are hard to see and wildlife was poor because of the villages nearby and the farming adjacent to the park. Really not worth it and a complete waste of money! We had superb safaris at Wilpattu and Wasgamuva, almost any other national park of Sri Lanka will offer you better value for money. You will see more diversity just driving around. Chose large national parks!","February 19, 2019",0.0,0.0

We saw elephants, crocodiles  and many birds during the day time around the bungalow. But when the time hits about 6 pm , it was a mosquito bungalow. We couldn't do any single thing on the evening but itching. They haven't took any precautions regarding this matter. We were sleeping in our own vehicles till morning since we were unable to sleep in their beds and we had to stay in Arugambay on the next day by paying extra cash for another hotel. Day time was really good and no doubt about it. Please make sure to ask about this matter if you want to visit here or you will be in big trouble like us. Specially if children/infants come along with you. Thanks","August 3, 2018",0.0,0.0

The Mahawewa Bungalow is one of the best constructed DWLC bungalows accross. Nice place to relax, but not that much elephants to see around. Luhugala Mahawewa Bungalow has 3 double rooms with one attached bath and two more baths adjoining the rooms, maximum of 10 people. Have to take your dry ration and the cooks will prepare the food. All kind of food stuff can be drought from Potuvill (Cargills Food City branch in Potuvill). Liqueur is not available around, so must bring/buy them from at least Monaragala. Can do the bungalow booking online via DWC website.","April 22, 2018",0.0,0.0
