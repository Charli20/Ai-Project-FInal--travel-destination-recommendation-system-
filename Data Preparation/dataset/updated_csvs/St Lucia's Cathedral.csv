This is the only big Cathedral in Sri Lanka.  It is really a colossal church in Sri Lanka and named among the biggest church too. From the angels guarding its car park entrance to the many iconic figures featured throughout its interior, this cathedral is impressive. It also featured one of the most ornate baptismal fonts that I have seen in churches of any denomination. St Lucia's Catholic Cathedral is for the most part hidden but but once in view is spectacular with its grand steps leading to an impressive interior. The cathedral is worth a visit and traces its origins to the Dutch who colonized Sri Lanka in the 1700's. Recently the renovated Cathedral is an architectural beauty. It is the main church of the Roman Catholics in Colombo. It is easily accessible with ample parking and it is a good place to visit. Its statue there was believed to be reached from a floating device. This is the best Cathedral in Sri Lanka. Looks so much similar to St. Peter's Basilica. It is calm and quiet and good to sit  and just wait. The architecture is beautifully crafted and the admin staff is friendly. This church still reminding about Ceylon past, all the Colombo old buildings were build by British people. This Church is well maintained and preserved to a very great level. I really salute the beautiful giant building.Pope John Paul II also visited in 1994 and conducted a holy mass . St. Lucia’s Cathedral has a very quiet atmosphere inside the cathedral considering its location. Sri Lankans of all faiths go to this church and make ""wows"" that they will fulfill if their prayers are answered. Working model of a pipe organ is visible but is not used now.I highly recommend the St. Lucias Cathedral. I loved this Church. Although some of the seats and kneeling structures are not working, I love to just sit and reflect inside this Church. Go and see this beautiful church and it is worth your visit when you visit Colombo. You can feed the poor people around the church. I have for ten years mostly visited this church continuously during Christmas eve. Spirits are high during mid-night mass and it is amazing to see the Royal Military band playing on these occasions.","October 14, 2017",0.0,0.0

Established since 1760, what sets it apart is not just its overwhelming vastness, but as a very special place of prayer and worship. Today, St. Lucia’s Cathedral is the spiritual centre of the Roman Catholic Church of the Colombo Archdiocese. Its spiritual atmosphere, shaped by the legacy left behind by early Oratarian Missionaries, is what gives devotees a deep closeness to God. It continues to nourish those who have sought comfort within her walls. I hope that your visit to our website gives you a sense of the beauty and historical value of the Cathedral. We also take great pleasure in warmly inviting you to personally visit this grand edifice that has stood the test of time.","September 12, 2014",0.0,0.0

Arrived around 4pm at the Cathedral and very quite with only a handful of local people, the atmosphere was quiet and relaxed, my Tuk Tuk driver was happy to take some pics of me looking around. Personally I felt the Cathedral was more impressive inside than the outside !!!! Stayed around 40 min's and so glad I visited this beautiful Cathedral, worth visiting for all ages.","September 25, 2013",0.0,0.0
