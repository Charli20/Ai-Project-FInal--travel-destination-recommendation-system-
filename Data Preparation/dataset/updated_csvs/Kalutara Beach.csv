I especially enjoyed my egg hoppers in the morning ... the chefs do a wonderful job and I had no complaints about choice ... the traditional food was wonderful also. The bar staff were always happy to speak with you and were very accommodating letting my husband watch cricket .. there was plenty of tea and coffee available which I enjoyed as I cant drink beer 24/7 My highest praise goes to the lovely  pool guys . I have arthritis and struggle shifting sunbeds , every day they made sure I was ok and had a sun bed and plenty of shade .. I cant thank them enough.. Our rep Nigel was very informative and sorted out a great trip for us . The only reason it didn't get the full 5 stars was continually being pestered on the beach .. my husband could cope with the banter but it got draining by the second week and it's not nice to be stared at when all you want to do is get some peace looking at the sea ..

An impressive sandy beach, quite exhilarating to visit and walk along. However, it  can be very dangerous due to the steeply sloping beach and strong undercurrents. When we visited the prevailing winds meant that there was no time for safe bathing as tides and waves were very high. The hotel had security/lifeguards who clearly advised about going into the sea. Sadly there seemed to be no daily clear up of the beach and so a certain amount of driftwood  at the high water mark. The beach is a public area and you are readily/rapidly approached by local people trying to sell wares or local services, as well as occasional beggars. They do not cross the fences/gates into the hotel grounds, but wait on the beach ready to approach any guests who do go out. Although a bit of hassle, clearly declining all offers got the message across and you were eventually left in peace· There are some cafes/businesses accessing the beach. We visited one  selling hand carved wooden wares. They were beautiful. The owner took great delight in showing off the products that he or his apprentices had made and  prepared. There was no real hassle in the workshop and a very genuine warmth from the owner and his wife, as well as a justifiable pride in their products. Overall a beautiful beach, but not practical if you were looking to swim and sunbathe, due to the wild seas, the lack of sunbathing facilities and continuing approaches from locals.","March 20, 2019",0.0,0.0
