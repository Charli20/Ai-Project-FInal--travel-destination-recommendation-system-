An all round favorite beach holiday. However, The sea pollution after a storm was diabolical (I’m talking loads and loads of plastic, rope, flip flops and even medical waste like needles thrown up by the rough seas)... While tourists (us included) took it upon ourselves to clean the beaches.... the locals, whose livelihoods depend on the beaches being clean, didn’t seem too perturbed and didn’t join in the clean up efforts. It’s our second vacation to this beautiful beach and the cleanliness of the beaches and ocean have noticibly declined. On the upside, many restaurants and cafes are serving paper or reusable straws which is a great sign. I do love coming to Sri Lanka and this beach in particular, I just feel that some ownership should be taken by tourists and locals alike to maintain the beaches.","February 19, 2019",0.0,0.0

Lots of places to rent boards and loungers, make sure you enquire about price before hand and a bit of gentle bargaining is Ok, but generally prices seem to be fixed unless you arrange something for a week. It is a nice beach but I still recommend going to other places for a look and experience. Service in the restaurants is pretty slow, but we weren't in a hurry.","January 3, 2019",0.0,0.0

They then pretend to check the fins are in good condition, but they don't really, they lightly touch them so as to not let on that one is already broken. Then as you're walking out into the water the broken fin comes off so you go back and they blame you and charge you several thousand rupees more than a fin is worth. Oh, and they follow you home with a group of their mates if you don't have the money on you. The fin that they pre-broke was worth less than 2000lkr and they tried to charge us 6000lkr. The people at our accommodation told us that these guys on the beach are always scamming people and getting into fights so beware.","March 12, 2018",0.0,0.0

I would recommend going here if you want a bit more solitude rather than the beach party scene. You can take a tuk tuk from Mirissa, it would probably take about 20 minutes, but you have to be very careful about hailing tuk tuks on the road. If you can, use a trusted one from your hotel rather than one from the road.","March 9, 2018",0.0,0.0
