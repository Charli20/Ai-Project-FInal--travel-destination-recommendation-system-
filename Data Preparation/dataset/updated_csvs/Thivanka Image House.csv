Many people skip it, but it’s absolutely worth seeing if you love history and art. Inside the building, you’ll find a huge standing Buddha statue that’s incredibly impressive. But what really amazed me were the ancient wall paintings still visible in parts of the interior. Even though some of the paint has faded over the centuries, you can still see beautiful details and colors that have survived for over 800 years. It’s incredible how talented the artists were back then. The atmosphere inside feels peaceful and a bit mysterious, as if you’re stepping back into another time. It’s not as crowded as other sites, which makes it even more special to explore. Tip: You can’t wear shoes inside, so bring a pair of socks, especially if you visit during the heat of the day because the stones can get warm! If you’re visiting Polonnaruwa, don’t miss Thivanka Image House. It’s perfect for anyone who loves hidden places, ancient art, and discovering the best places to travel.","July 16, 2025",0.0,0.0

As the last place to visit in Polonnaruwa Archaeological site, should visit thisplace Although it is not on the main road and not visited by the group tours you should visit this temple if you get the chance. It is very close to Gal Vihara and the two should be visited together. At Thivanka Image house, you can see ancient classical arts and enchanting sculptures of the Polonnaruwa era. The word 'Thivanka' literally means 'three curves'. Since it is the largest image of Lord Buddha in this image house is curved in three places, it is called 'Thivanka'. In Polonnaruwa, this place has one of the tallest brick built Lord Buddha statue named ""Tivanka"". #The curves are from shoulder, hip and knee. The shrine contains lots of beautiful fresco. When we visited this place there was a person who explains almost all the important things about this ancient place. This is another place for frescoes other than at Sigiriya but more accessible and are at ground level. Unlike Sigiriya this frescos are painted on the wall of a Buddhist temple This image house has drawings which was done a couple of centuries ago. Despite the outside being covered in scaffolding, it's still possible to see some fantastic stone carvings (quite unlike anything we'd seen in Anuradhapura). The inside of the Image House has a church-like feeling in it.  The keeper opened a small door so that we could walk on the corridor which runs behind the giant headless Buddha. Although the murals are worn out, they're still worthy of inspection. #There are frescoes explains about Buddha. You have to watch carefully and understood what it is. There are no frescoes we have seen like these in the world the places I visited. Both inside and outside the Image House is beautiful. It  has currently with a huge roof constructed over the whole site for its preservation and protection. # A headless standing Buddha inside, as well as the remains of beautiful paintings and artwork and wonderful carvings. All those paintings are about stories, while in the entresols the Bodhisattva in Tusitha heaven. Inner room appear the incidents of Buddha. There are so many decorations to see. Inscriptions and chronicles saying this statue of Lord Buddha is decorated by a valuable jem earlier but it was disappeared & the statue was destroyed in 993 AC.
