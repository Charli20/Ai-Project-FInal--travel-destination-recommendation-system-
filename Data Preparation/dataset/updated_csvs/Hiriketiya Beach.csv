We had booked a week at the Palm House Hiriketiya. 2 weeks before check-in we were asked to cancel our booking via Booking.com. It was not possible due to renovations. When we got there we saw that another guest was staying there. He had probably paid the better price over New Year. That was just the first rip-off. We booked another hotel. When we arrived there was no water. The whole place was affected, which of course was not true. Later in a seafood restaurant we ordered red snapper. But it wasn't red snapper and was totally inedible. We still had to pay $30 for fish with 2 beers. And so it went on. The only good thing was smoke and bitters.

I wouldn’t quite call it the hidden gem of the south coast, as it is growing in popularity, but it’s not too far off it. The neighboring town, Dikwella (known locally as Dickwella), has become a huge draw to people visiting Sri Lanka’s south coast. The laid-back lifestyle and surf vibes at Hiriketiya Beach and Dikwella have created those amazing coastal towns we absolutely love. The result is this magnetic draw similar to other trendy surf towns worldwide, whether it is Siargao in the Philippines, Tofino in Canada or Margaret River in Australia – people love the environment it creates.

If you want to chill, swim, snorkeling or surf - this place is the right one. Away from crowds with a few places to eat, drink and get a sunbed. You can rent surfboards (very cheap) in here . There are 2 surfing areas: the main beach break (perfect for beginners) and a fast left wave in the Eastern side of the beach.  I was surfing when green turtles popped up right under me! That was so unique. The vibe in the water is also incredible - people surfing here are very cheering and happy. No screaming or unnecessary competition for waves. It's just perfect. So far my favorite beach in Sri Lanka ! The western side of the beach is very calm and no waves if you want to swim and snorkel.

It is quite a small beach and most of it is taken up by surf board rentals, restaurant/cafe tables and sun loungers for rent, leaving almost no sand free. You really do need to rent sun loungers as there is little space to spread out your towels on the sand and if you have children there isn't much room for them to play.  It may be a good spot to learn to surf, but if that is not your aim there may be better options.","January 26, 2020",0.0,0.0

Having a great and pleasant time until my husband hands back the board and then a young lad tries calling us over and demand 20,000rupees because of a crack in the board (all boards heavily used and not in new condition clearly as such a busy beach) Obviously argued that we would not pay such an obscene figure and that all the boards in used condition and we honestly did not cause any damage.

You will be targeted especially if you look vulnerable or like you have never surfed before (that’s clearly what happened to us).

Can almost guarantee in next few years tourism will take over so go now while it's still a somewhat secret paradise. Only thing I couldn't help but notice was the amount of NAKED children on the beach. Some of them 8 or 9 years old - in my option, very inappropriate. Protect your kids from the high UV and also cover them up!!","February 21, 2016",0.0,0.0

If you are looking to party maybe don't bother. I was here with two other mates and we just enjoyed the beach, had some fun small waves, and snokerlled and fished. Three places to eat. Dots beach house is good but really expensive. Hiriketiya beach house is nice. The other joint is shocking. Foods ok but takes at least an hour and a half to come out. We went three times. Twice for dinner and once for breaky. Go to either of the first two. It's a good place. Will prob get ruined by tourism over the next few years so go now!!","January 21, 2016",0.0,0.0
