As your guide, I’m excited to share the incredible story behind this ancient masterpiece, which has stood the test of time for over 1,500 years. Standing at an impressive 42 feet, this awe-inspiring statue was carved out of a single granite rock during the reign of King Dhatusena in the 5th century. The craftsmanship here is extraordinary—notice how the robes seem to flow naturally over the Buddha's body, even though it’s all carved from stone. This statue represents the “Asisa Mudra,” a gesture of blessing, and you’ll feel a sense of calm and spirituality just by looking at the serene expression on the Buddha’s face. As we stand here in the peaceful surroundings near the Kala Wewa reservoir, it’s easy to imagine how this site was not only a place of worship but also a hub of culture and art in ancient Sri Lanka. The skill and precision of the stone carving are a testament to the expertise of the craftsmen of that time. This was not just a religious monument but a statement of artistic achievement. What makes the Awukana statue even more fascinating is that it has been well-preserved over the centuries, despite being exposed to the elements. You’ll be amazed at how much detail still remains, especially in the folds of the robes and the delicate facial features. For any visitor to Sri Lanka, this is a must-see destination—not just for its religious significance but also for its historical and artistic value. Whether you're a history buff, a spiritual traveler, or simply someone who appreciates magnificent art, the Awukana Buddha Statue offers a unique glimpse into Sri Lanka’s rich cultural past. I hope you enjoy your visit and leave with a deeper understanding of Sri Lanka’s ancient heritage!","September 23, 2024",0.0,0.0

You can reach Avukana from Thambuttegama, Galewela as well as from Kekirawa side or even via Kurunegala- hiripitiya-Madagalla. A lot of roads around the area were being newly carpeted at the time we visited. Even the access road to the avukana statue was in good condition and you can go down the same road up to kalawewa. Once you go down the access roads, the Google maps will say you have reached the location when there is nothing in sight! Drive a couple of hundred meters forwards and you will come to a place that looks like park a with small shops etc. There is ample parking and some small shops selling snacks and drinks.

There is another nearby standing statue of the Buddha, quite similar to the Avukana statue, at Sasseruwa. According to legend, the two statues are the result of a competition between a stone sculpting master and pupil. The story goes that the master constructed the Avukana statue, while the pupil made the statue at Sasseruwa. The first to complete his statue had to notify the other by ringing a bell. The master managed to complete his statue first, and won the competition. This is said to be why the Sasseruwa statue is unfinished. However the statue is very important for Buddhists.

After an hour's drive from Anuradhapura we arrived close to the site and were stopped by the village kids that the van cannot go further to the site owing to flash floods. They told us that we could walk across the train track and the rail bridge to get to the site. The excitement to view a tall standing Buddha overcame our risk assessment skills and we took the challenge with 2 elders of about 70 years and kids 11 & 6 years. However, the crossing was not as easy as we thought. The steps between the rail's sleeper logs were sometimes more than 2 feet apart crossing them with a stream of madly rushing water below was not at all easy. The thought of missing a step and falling into the gushing water below was scary, besides creating a vertigo effect to make the adrenalin rush more. The kids who were skilled to run across the bridge held our hands and made it possible to cross as we had no option to retreat half way through! Finally we got to see the tall standing pose of Buddha carved out of a single rock and it was a calming effect for the mad adrenalin rush until that moment.

The last time I visited this place was about 10 years ago. Drove to Kekirawa and took the Thalawa road. Then went along the Kalawewa reservoir.  Asked for directions at junctions. It was around 2.30 PM when I visited the place. Just a few foreigners and about 2 locals. I had the entire place for my self. I cannot explain the feeling . It was so quite , calm and relaxing. Stayed for about 1 hour and made a small donation to the temple. A place worthy of a visit definitely.","August 13, 2013",0.0,0.0

The statue is between Polonnaruwa and Anuradhapura on the Kekirawa Road. The statue carved out of a living rock stands at a height at 12 meters and is the tallest Buddha statue in existence. There is a close resemblance to the Bamiyan Buddha statue in Afghanistan. Traveling to and from the site could take 2 hours from either end (Anuradhapura/ Polonnaruwa).,"October 31, 2012",0.0,0.0
