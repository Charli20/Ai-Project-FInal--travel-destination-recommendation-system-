The safari drive takes you through forests, grasslands, and around the famous Minneriya tank. During the dry season, you can witness large herds gathering, which is truly impressive. Besides elephants, we also spotted deer, birds, and other wildlife. The experience feels peaceful and exciting at the same time.

We were met by our safari driver at our hotel and taken to the park. There are lots of local independent tour operators in the area who are able to do the drives in the park. We had a driver throughout our trip in Sri Lanka and he organised the jeep safari on our behalf. Our jeep driver spoke good English. He encouraged us to stand up as he drove through the park. And it felt exhilarating to drive along dusty tracks, hair whipping in your face, sun shining and excitedly looking out for wildlife. The park had a 'jurassic park' type vive about it.... ....And then we came across monkeys to whet our appetite. Before coming upon a small herd of elephants. There was a female, very, very heavily pregnant- who was likely to give birth in the next week or so. Another female had a baby calf (about 1-2weeks old). The elephants can come VERY close to the jeeps. When there's an elephant siting, a LOT of jeeps descend. And at times, I felt a bit uncomfortable at the number of carfuls of people. However, if the elephants do approach, the jeep drivers do make a hasty retreat. Everywhere you go in Sri Lanka, there is litter everywhere. It was a nice change that there was hardly any plastic waste in the park where the elephants roam.... .....Apart from one area around the other side of the lake. Tourists are encouraged to get out of the jeep, pose for photos at the waterside, and climb a lookout view point. There was SO MUCH rubbish littered here. As about 100 people were congregated, a shout went out from our driver. A herd of elephants were approaching. Within minutes we were all ushered back into our jeeps. We thought this was for safery, but this was actually so that we could follow them again and watch them enter the water for a refreshing dip. We saw baby elephants, pregnant matriarchs, bull elephants, a few juveniles play-fighting. And we learnt how elephants kick up the grass and loosen it from the ground, pick it up with their trunks and shake out the grass before eating it. They truly are magnificent animals and it was lovely to see them in a natural habitat, where human interaction is limited to about 30-ish jeep-fuls at a time. All in all we saw about 30-ish elephants during our afternoon safari. And a bonus: on our way back to our hotel, we saw elephants in the grass beside the roadside!!","September 5, 2025",0.0,0.0

Peacocks and butterflies were more commonly visible while an eagle and some other exotic birds in smaller numbers. Going one way (about an hour)  was exciting though while coming back the same route was taken and kind of felt dull because we knew the elephants aren’t going to show up anymore.

There were probably 20-30 other 4wd’s sharing the experience so it can get a bit hectic. The elephants generally seemed to ignore the visitors.

The drivers have their route around the park, and off course there were more jeeps driving around. We were lucky that we were late in the midday, so we had only a few jeeps around us. The driver took us around the water and at some point he stops and shutdown the engine so you really can enjoy the beautiful and silence in the park. When your driver sees an animal, he will point at it so you can take a photo of it. In the beginning we saw a group of elephants in the distance  and this was really amazing to see in real life (not in a zoo). At some point we drove thru a bushed area and when we reached back in the open again we were surrounded by many elephants and other animals, In 1 word.... WOW!! Really amazing and unique, I recommend everybody who is in the Area or is on Sri Lanka, to go to this National Park.","September 20, 2019",0.0,0.0

Our plans were to climb Pidurangala Rock for sunrise and for the afternoon of our arrival we had hoped to do a kayaking trip on the nearby river. However, despite mentioned in Lonely Planet's guide, Rasta Rant does not offer those trips anymore. So, we decided to return to our accommodation and since we are quite new to Sri Lanka and it is our first time here, relied on the help of our hosts to arrange the Safari on short-notice, instead of booking an offer we had found on Air BnB. The trip for two people was quickly scheduled and a driver showed up in his jeep an hour later. After driving for a while, he pulled on to a gas station, where he asked us whether we were going to Minneriya or some other park. We quickly said Minneriya, as this was what we had asked for from our hosts. Once we got to the park, the driver (whom we had paid beforehand - 13,000 Rupees for 2 people as agreed with our hosts), went to the ticket counter. While he was gone, a man in what appeared to us as a park ranger uniform approached us and told us that today was a great day to see the elephants. When our driver returned, him and the ""ranger"" quickly exchanged some words, followed by him also getting into our car, shaking our hands and introducing himself. During the drive he seemed very knowledgable in terms of the different animals and birds, told us he has been working at the park for over 10 years and that he would know all the best spots to see the elephants. Every now and then he hammered against the side of the jeep to make the driver stop and show us something. Everything seemed fine, until at the end of the drive the ""ranger"" got up to ask us if we were ""very happy"" and mumbled something about ""I really need the tips."" That's when we realised that this man is as far away from an official ranger as possible. We passed him some money so he would leave us alone and after again exchanging some words with the jeep driver, disappeared into the woods. We already felt quite embarrassed that we had mistaken him for an official ranger, when our driver made us stop at a local vegetable plantation and encouraged us to buy corn. We kindly refused and were relieved when finally returning to our accommodation. Then, when we got out of the car, he claimed that Minneriya was more expensive than the initial quote and demanded an extra 2000 Rupees from us. We were completely confused, but ended up refusing and walking away from his vehicle. If you're planning on visiting the park - please make sure to compare prices, and don't make our mistake and fall for the false rangers. BUT: The park itself is beautiful, we had lots of close encounters with elephants and other wildlife, saw different kinds of eagles, water buffalos and jackals - which overall, was worth the hassle - so overall - we absolutely recommend visiting the park.","July 9, 2019",0.0,0.0

You are able to get quite close to herds of elephants grazing along the lake side as well as individuals hiding in the thick scrub only metres off the road. Water buffalo herds are also aplenty and were interesting to watch frolicking in the shallow waters of the lake. A storm blew up suddenly while we were out in the parklands requiring the roof of the 4WD to be quickly drawn over us. Then we discovered the mouse living in the rolled up roof and shared the ride with him/her for the rest of the trip.

Hire Special Safari as they were fantastic! I read that older jeeps are better as they can go through the water in the park and not get stuck - this was true. We sailed through whilst other newer jeeps became stuck. Our driver was an excellent guide, he knew exactly where to go to see a multitude of animals. We saw: elephants, mongoose, snake, jackals, eagles, deer, herds of water buffaloes, monkeys, peacocks, herons, bee eater, monitor lizards to name but a few. Our driver Giayan was patient, there was never a rush. We set off at at 2.10pm and returned at 6.30pm, giving us 3.5 hours in the park (it's about 30 mins from Special Safari in the middle of Habanara to the middle of the park).

I can't recommend Special Safari highly enough to do the safari in Minneriya.

The jeeps on this occasion had room to manoeuvre and the elephants were all very obliging and all jeeps kept their distance and even waited if elephants approached to let them have their way.  So I did enjoy this park much more - seeing elephant families doing their own thing without being hassled by the jeeps was most enjoyable.  Birdlife was the only other wildlife but there were large and small herds everywhere in this park and I didn't feel the jostling of jeeps too much.  Most drove up slowly, found a position and parked to allow us to take photographs or just enjoy their antics.  On our safari I didn't feel that the jeep drivers were encroaching on the elephants as all the jeeps seem to follow the track, parked off to the side and allowed us to just watch the elephants - yes mothers put their babies on the other side of the jeeps, but continued feeding, and the babies of course continued playing. I actually quite enjoyed the afternoon safari as instead of getting hotter, it cooled as the afternoon sun began to set. We were a private group with our own guide so we had a pre-arranged driver for this attraction, so it was just us in a slightly newer and more comfortable jeep - open topped and a little dusty, but allowed you to stand and take photos when the jeep stopped. Have an open mind here - Sri Lankan is a developing country and has a long way to go so don't expect the same level of eco-tourism you would get in other countries.","April 20, 2019",0.0,0.0

Ironically, we saw two elephants (one of them with tasks, quite rare) by the side of the road on our drive back to the hotel. Our driver was quick to spot them in the semi-darkness, and we were much closer to them than in the wildlife park.

Then with the young males who had been kicked out from the herd just feeding a short way from the main herd.  Interesting to watch the antics of some larger males finding their way into the smaller herds to check out the females. Yes there are a lot of safari jeeps but it did not seem as chaotic as in the Yala National Park and I think this is due to the fact that this park has a rather large open area of grass around lakes that allow for the army of jeeps to park by the road and allow for viewing by everyone as there were elephants everywhere.  In Yala once an elusive leopard is found, it's a race on for ever driver to get their clients a sighting and the tracks are narrow and not as open as in Minneriya. I loved watching the babies, and yes the protective mothers keeping their bodies to the jeep side, but both continued grazing whilst we looked on. Watching elephant behaviour was interesting -  a mother comin out from a bamboo thicket as we approached in the jeep.  We stopped. She stopped. She waited - we didn't move.  Then obviously when she thought it was safe, she signalled to the two younger elephants and one by one out of the thicket they came and crossed the track. I didn't feel the driver of our safari jeep hassled the elephants at all.  All the jeeps seemed to give them the space. If the elephant came behind the jeep, the driver stopped, waited for the elephant to pass or do what it wanted, before the driver proceeded along the track   The park appears to have designated trails that the vehicles can use and the jeeps generally stated on this track or to the side if they needed to pass. Its main purpose for this park I think is for wild elephant viewing, but we also saw lots of birdlife around the lake. We did an afternoon safari from 3pm and I found the seats were very nicely padded in our vehicle but seatbelts I think are optional, but then I was standing up a lot when the vehicle was parked or moving slowly along. It's not for everyone as it's hot, it's bumpy, but I enjoyed it.","March 13, 2019",0.0,0.0

Therefore, my standards before taking part in the Minneriya safari tour were very high.  Having said that, I have to recognize I would never recommend this place to go on a safari. For many reasons. First of all, because you will start the tour with dozens of jeeps leaving at the same time. Then, the feeling that the safari is not meant to offer you an experience with wildlife by watching the animals in their natural habitat, but to give tourists the chance to get the snapshots they need to share with their friends on the social media. But the main reason I would advice to avoid this safari is that, although most of the jeep drivers (like ours) were professional and respectful to wildlife, some of them showed any respect at all for either the environment or the elephants. At one moment, we saw 5 jeeps off the road blocking a group of elephants, and preventing them no just from moving away, but from moving at all. If the park allowed less vehicles at a time and enforced stricter rules on how to approach the animals, as they do in other parks, it would be an enjoyable experience we all would benefit from.","March 9, 2019",0.0,0.0

The jeep had no seatbelts and the driver drove very dangerously so we had to hold on to the metal construction of the car. We were all sore at the end wirh our hands dirty from the rust. However, the main problem was that there were 100 jeeps (with 2 or 3 people) chasing 1 or 2 elephants. The area of the park is quite small, so imagine 100 jeeps racing to get the closest to the animal, going off the roads and through the jungle senseless. At one point the jeeps completely surrounded a mother with a baby. The jeeps didn't even turn off their engines and made so much noise. This is not ethical. This is not connecting with nature. This is not sustainable. This is taking advantage of animals and the environment.

I understand that people need jobs here, but this is not a sustainable way and there are better systems in other National Parks. Jeeps crowd chaoticly around an elephant and sometimes the driver couldn’t get through or just drives by because there is no space to stop. Fumes and noise from the jeeps were constantly around me.

It seems that there is little regard for the environment or the wildlife as a large number of vehicles thrash around a relatively small area. I had the feeling that the tour was not about the wildlife at all, but about giving tourists a four wheel drive experience - not what we signed up for. The park itself appears to be in a sad state with many invasive weed species; the roads are overused by the heavy vehicle traffic and poorly maintained. We saw a few elephants, but the experience was marred by the volume of jeeps jostling for position.

I did not have great expectations for this, but I hoped for a quiet drive, looking for animals at a slow pace. What I got was way too many jeeps traveling bumper to bumper, with drivers busy racing, rather than spotting animals. It was clear the driver was in no way interested in anything, but getting his cash for a ride as fast as possible.  I understand that a certain amount of overcharging is always going on and I don’t mind too much, as long as it is a genuine experience. This was just a ripoff. When finally we reached a herd of elephants, the poor animals were already surrounded by way too many jeeps.

The resort owner arranged for his driver, Sanjeev, to take us to Monneriya in his keep with an open or closed back. I had expected that there would be a limited number of vehicles and visitors permitted along a specific track so as to allow for an ordered viewing of wild animals from a respectful distance. What we got instead was a mob, an unruly mob of over 250 keeps of every size, carrying from 1 to 6 people. Most, perhaps 80%, had just two people! As was our case. The drivers often communicated with each other by cellphones and were respectful to each other. The poor animals, almost all elephants, were relegated to third class gawking status hemmed in by jeeps who at times prevented them from grazing freely and reaching the lake, their ultimate destination that afternoon. I have been to wildlife reserves and national parks in many countries over 6 decades, and Minneriya was the worst, the most pedestrian in wildlife management. It was clearly a cash grab for the park and for the jeep drivers. It was a disgusting sight to see over 200 vehicles going here and there over new and used tracks, just chasing after groups of elephants, with a total lack of respect or concern for these sensitive animals. Sri Lanka should be censured by the World Wildlife Fund and various UN and International bodies for this sham of a national park. Humans 100, elephants 0. A bloody shame. Foreign visitors would do well to boycott Monneriya for now until the Sri Lankan authorities get their heads out of the well of greed. Boycot boycot boycot.","October 9, 2018",0.0,0.0

The safari is basic but fun, you park in the car park, climb in the back of a jeep and get driven around the park to seek out the elephants. We went in the afternoon as that's when they are most likely to congregate at the lake. Our jeep driver was very good, the two of us bounced around in the back - just two side benches, three padded cross bars to hold onto if you want to stand up. No Health & Safety here - hold on tight to avoid bashing your bits against the side of the jeep, and if standing, duck to avoid branches thwacking you in the face! Remember sun cream as there's no cover, and a hat is risky to blow off if there's wind. We saw loads of elephants - noisy, playful, muddy, but and small. There was one suckling it's mother, still a bit pink, that our driver said was about ten days old. We did this as part of a four day tour which originally had the elephant sanctuary in its itinerary, but switched to Minneriya before we travelled.

Despite the commercialisation of the trip - there must have been 50+ Land Cruisers around the reservoir - the park is big enough to give one a good view of the herd, especially as it gathers in late afternoon before going into the forest to sleep. They came from all around, to drink, wash and play in the shallow waters, before setting off in a column and heading back into the forest - and they were so quiet. No squealing from the baby elephants, nor thudding of feet from the adults, but simply an inexorable susuration as they walked past us. The area is also home to many other species, and we saw many types of bird, including the omni-present egrets, ibis and other water fowl.

I don't understand the high rating – I know from discussions with locals that our visit was not an exception. We could not really enjoy when we saw several families of elephants totalizing probably a hundred – we rather were impatient to leave. Why? 1. at that place where the elephants gathered, I counted 40 jeeps. We thought we stay and the rush would stop, but no, the queue behind us was endless. What an absurd approach: you go to see peaceful nature and wildlife and you see more jeeps than elephants, hear more jeep noise than birds singing, smell stinking diesel gas instead of flowers, plants or elephant poo. 2. The jeeps go so close to the elephants that they get annoyed by it and run away (sometimes less than 10 meters). It is fine for me when the jeep stops a hundreds of meters away and the elephant gets close, but not when the jeep gets closer and closer so that tourists without cameras or binoculars can shoot stupid selfies with their smart phone. And even less when they cut their road when they go to the water or even following them when they calmly run away. We are nature and elephant lovers and were so keen to see them in the wild for the first time (we got close to them only during a volunteering mission in a refuge for domesticated elephants). And we were so sad and keen to run away when we actually saw them. I understand elephants are part of Sri Lanka's tourism industry, but cannot accept that elephants pay the price – they paid already too much.","July 8, 2018",0.0,0.0

Apparently the park was aware of it but inter-departmental politics and red tape was preventing something being done about it. The elephant was clearly in pain.

The Jeep safari should not cost more than LKR (Srilankan Rupees) 3500-4000 for the entire jeep. The entrance tickets to the park is steep but worth the price. The jeep can seat easily 6 persons.

Some jeeps have 2-3 rows of seats which makes the jeep cramped and no space to stand for viewing animals. The Park has dense population of elephants.

I have seen but reviews of people saying it was crowded. It must have been we went late during the day, but we just came across 2 more jeeps in the whole safari We arrived just after 3pm. We were travelling with locals who arranged a safari driver that was at the entrance for only Rs3000 (bear in mind that you may be overcharged if you don't have someone to negotiate it). The entrance fee is almost none for locals and quite higher for foreigners, but still quite reasonable. We started the safari and were able stand up on the jeep and get amazing views. The first part of the route is a dense forest, but when you reach the opening, the views are stunning. You'll see hundreds of birds, storks, pheasants, beer eaters, herons, pelicans, eagles, etc. There are also spotted deers roaming around. The driver was knowledgeable and would point at different species. We saw elephants far away, then, a lonely one 50 meters away and then we came close to three, i.e. a mum with the two kids. We were totally amazed at seeing wild animals at less than 30 meters away and suddenly the protective and caring mother charged at us. It was terrifying yet astounding. The mum just wanted to ensure that we didn't hurt her kids. We drove for over an hour seeing birds, butterflies, tortoises, deers and when we thought viewings were over we saw a young grey leopard. It was just breathtaking, but the young fellow disappeared before we got our cameras out so it only got imprinted in our memories. Overall, we spent 2 hours enjoying beautiful views and spotting some of Sri Lankan amazing wild life. Highly recommended.","May 28, 2018",0.0,0.0

So the thought of doing a safari to possibly see elephants was not top of our list in Sri Lanka. But our driver said we wouldn’t be disappointed so we gave it a go. First impressions great - we had our own jerk and driver. None of the group squeezing into one huge jeep for twenty with limited views. As we entered the National Park and drove around for 15mins I started to recognise in myself that desperation you feel looking for anything, something to make you think you just MIGHT see an animal. After another five minutes we slowed down and poking its head through some palms was a huge elephant munching on some food. That alone left us happy and content as it had already surpassed expectations. Amazing We then drove around the corner and found ourselves surrounded - literally surrounded by a herd of about 300 elephants. All slowly eating and gradually edging toward a lake for water. We saw families, babies and even rare tusked elephants (apparently only about 6% have tusks here). Words cannot describe the experience. We slowly drive around with them for an hour finding it hard to pull ourselves away. We eventually did to drive around another corner of the lake only to have another herd of about 200 doing the same. There is nothing more amazing than watching the sunset and these amazing animals calmly go about their business with no fear of humans or the Jeep and most importantly in their natural habitat living wild.

It is probably almost certain that you'll see elephants any time of the year. But here's a reality check for you: the Jeep 'safari' that you've got in mind almost certainly will involve your Jeep and around twenty or thirty others that all jostle for position as soon as an unfortunate elephant is sighted. We're talking here of revving engines, other jeeps parking between you and the elephant so you can't see it.  You're going to be one of maybe 100 gawking tourists. We were actually caught in a traffic jam in the park! Horrible! This is unsustainable tourism. The Jeep drivers are not quite cowboys but close to it. There is no time or room for contemplating the wonders of nature in silence because all you'll here are revving engines. You might as well go to a zoo.

However, we found a gap in our schedule, and our excellent guide from Sri Lanka Personal Drivers set up a safari for us in a private 2 seat Jeep. We went around 1:30 in the afternoon, and it ended up being the perfect time (on the way out, we saw dozens of jeeps coming in, while we were the only one heading out). This also meant we had a five minute line for tickets, whereas the day before apparently had been an hour+. The first 20 minutes inside the park is just getting to the location, so you don't see much. But once it opens up, it was astonishing. We saw 3 distinct groups of elephants, each numbering 40-50. At times we were mere feet away. From not on the itinerary, it became easily one of our top experiences in Sri Lanka. Be aware that the elephants do tend to move around, so ensure you get word on whether they are more located at Kaudulla or Minneriya during your visit.

October is the shoulder season, before the monsoon which means there are still plenty of elephants to see in the park but not the big crowds of the high season. It is a beautiful park.  After a 30 minute drive through the jungle/forest and spotting a minute lizard, chameleon, monkeys and several bird species, the park opens up to a huge plain which in the wet is mostly a lake.  In the dry the lake is smaller but still significant. Apparently 300- 400 elephants come down to the lake-side at the height of dry season in August to drink.  We saw a herd of about 30 with many babies, and two other smaller beards plus a few bulls, one up close. We were able to get fairly close to the large heard and there were at most three or four other vehicles, so everyone had a chance to see.  The baby elephants frolicked and fed making for great photos and video. There was also a large herd of water buffaloes and many pea cocks and hens.  Also some interesting bird life. The ride is a little rough especially if you stand rather than sit which we did for the view. But this would only be a problem for the very frail.  Our guide was very helpful and knowledgeable.

The entrance is exhorbitantly costly, advisable if a bargain is striked with the Jeep driver of the park else it is a complete Drain on ones pocket and timein this Park. One has to be prepared to get a very sad upkeep of the park as if deteriorated by insiders of its greens and woods, as well as there is no such proper fauna and flora for the animals to be part of this park. this view is as compared to one in tour in south africa or Kenya. The entire park area is sadistically barren, hardly any Animals to be spotted and one gets completely drenched out in the scorching sun with no beautiful aura of the entire park as such. pleas emake sure to cancel out this unadvisable, uneconomical and time wasting trip that has no value when the management itself has no interest in the upkeep of Animals and its flora and Fauna  compared the country being full of green flora and fauna else where in wild.
