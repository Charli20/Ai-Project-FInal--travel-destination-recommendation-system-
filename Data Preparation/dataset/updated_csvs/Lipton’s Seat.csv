Normaal is bewezen 1500 and 3000. The tea plantions are nice to see. There is almost little cafe/restaurant at the top where you can drink tea. People are very sweet. The Lipton Seat is Just a statue on a bench and you can make pictures with. Some nice views. On cloudy days theres no view and than theres not much to do. I would reccomend but for a cheaper price. The tuk tuk is the most expensive thing in our case.,"October 8, 2025",0.0,0.0

Perched high in the lush tea country of Sri Lanka, this iconic viewpoint offers breathtaking panoramas of rolling hills and verdant tea estates. On a clear day, you can see all the way to the southern coast! The journey to the top is just as magical, winding through scenic tea plantations and charming villages. I always recommend arriving early in the morning to catch the sunrise—it’s an unforgettable experience. The small tea shop near the summit serves a perfect cup of Ceylon tea, adding a cozy touch to the visit. It’s a fantastic spot for photography, relaxation, or simply soaking in the serene ambiance. Whether you’re a nature enthusiast, a tea lover, or a traveler seeking peace, Lipton’s Seat is a destination you’ll treasure.

The clouds come in quite quickly.  We got a tuk tuk from Ella very early in the morning.  It was a pleasant trip but can get quite bumpy with hair pin corners, I would not self drive here.  Stunning views and you can walk up if you like but I think they still try and charge you a fee.  The tea plantations are such an incredible view and the tea pickers were starting for the day and kids off to school waving.  There was a man at the top trying to tell you the history and offer to take photos for you all for a fee of course.  Then there is a little blue shed that sell you tea with jaggery which is really nice and some food for a really reasonable price.  Sit there and watch the cheeky monkeys.

The view was stunning at the top, luckily we had a nice clear morning.   If your driving your own tuk tuk from Ella, google maps will send you directly there.  However this track although the prettiest landscape in sri lanka through the tea plantations and villages ,  is incredibly rough and rather tricky at times.  Definitely not for everyone.  If you put via Haputale into maps it will  take you on a much better road.  Still very pretty and rough at  the top but that's the fun of the trip.

We're up at 5:00 am. We had booked a tuk-Tuk the day before through the accommodation in Haputale. It takes you an hour to get there. That's 16 km from Haputale.

Photos of the sunrise. Photo with the figure of Mr. Lipton. There is a coffee machine where you have a tea for 100 LKR. And you appreciate it. Because it's cold. Take windbreakers or sweatshirt. Meet the driver at the Dambatenne Tea Factory and walk back between tea terraces. It's 8 km downhill. If you get your bearings right you can take some shortcuts to cross between the tea fields. If not, follow the road and there is no loss. You'll cross paths with women who go to work. They'll ask you to take a picture to give them some money.

We only spent one morning there, but I would be happy to return for multiple consecutive days just to walk around and enjoy the views. Many people only speak of Lipton Seat as a place to go in this area, but I was unimpressed by the actual Lipton Seat. It essentially is just a view-point of the land looking off the mountain at the land below, not a view of the rolling hills patterned with tea trees. The true beauty of this area is the entire tea estate you go through en route to Lipton Seat. The best time to go is the morning—the earlier the better. It started to get clouded over by 10 AM, so if you are walking, arrive early. I would recommend arriving to the Dambetenne Tea Factory between 7:00 - 8:00 AM (or earlier). Then, just start walking up to road, which is about 7km to the top. There are tuk-tuks which can take you up or down, either for a round trip quick ride to the top or by walking one way and riding the other. However, you would likely miss a lot of the wonderful views in a tuk-tuk. We leisurely walked up and walked down in about 4 hours, and stopped for tea and appetizers at the top (which were delicious). Along the way down, we decided to get off the road and walk down the same paths as many of the workers picking the leaves and it was absolutely wonderful to interact with them. They were so friendly and welcoming and wanted to chat with us, encouraging us to come with them as they continued to walk and work. It’s one of the most beautiful place in SL, in my opinion—and the women working in the fields are equally beautiful and filled with generosity and love.

At one stay we were the only people up there, with a few other tourists floating around. Its $250 rupee for two people and a tuktuk to get up to the top - ticket gate is 1.5km from top. Go all the way. At the top we had a cuppa tea $50 rupee, and some snacks - wade, samosa and chapati - all $50 rupee each. **Tip for the cafe at the top - just get a tea, and when you walk down to the Lipton Tea Factory at the bottom (7km and 1-1.5 hr leisurely stroll) there is a very tasty local vendor selling wade and alike which are packed full of herbs and flavour - so yummy and only $20 rupee each (see photo!) Tour of the factory was $250 rupee per person - and very interesting. Same building and some machines that Sir Thomas created in the late 1890s. I’m not a history buff, but found it interesting to see the process. We caught the local bus back to Haputale $36 rupee per person. Took around 30-40 mins.

Our driver very sensibly left our car at the Factory and we took a tuk-tuk to the top. The road is narrow, twisty and passes through picturesque tea plantations on either side, it's a good ride (reasonably paved and suitable for tuk-tuks) with opportunities to photograph the tea pickers en route. Lots of people it seems chose to walk both up and down from Dambatenne, but our guides sensible suggestion was that it's better to ride up and walk down if you have the time. As there are over 950 reviews on TA currently I'm not going to be able to provide any new facts although I would say that even when the weather has mist rolling in and you can't see the fantastic views of Ella Gap from the summit, as we couldn't, we still thoroughly enjoyed our visit. The little restaurant on the top does some great authentic food too at a very reasonable cost. Go for it! As a side issue - The road to Dambatenne is lined with many notices stating various things concerning nature and the environment, regrettably as we were passing in the car they went by too quickly to read. Some were very wordy. However, one I had chance to read stated: ""The future of our Nature belongs to the nature of our Future"". How profound! If you take your time on the road I'm sure you'll take pleasure in reading many more. Footnote: We went up to Lipton's Seat on a very clear day we had no indication and had no idea that views from the summit would be completely obscured by mist, in the opposite direction it was as clear as a bell!","March 13, 2019",0.0,0.0

Whole route is jaw-dropping. Our driver stopped several times for us to let us enjoy various views. On the very top there is a platform from where 360 degree panoramic view opens in front of you and you can watch countless plantation hills disappearing in clouds below you and if weather is opportune you can even see ocean in the distance. We arrived in the afternoon and due to locals we were very lucky about weather conditions that day, cause usually people visit in the early morning to have the best visibility possible. I would recommend to do so, apparently it is not unusual thing to not be able to see further than 10 meters around you.

If not, I would make the trek out to visit. It was about a 1.5 hour tuk tuk ride from Ella on some scary roads once you get closer to Lipton's Seat. If you have a fear of heights - this is not the drive for you. I'd highly recommend taking a tuk tuk over a car if you can, the roads are extremely narrow  and I saw multiple cars have a difficult time getting through. If you are self-driving (as we were) I would absolutely discourage self-driving here because there is very little room for error. You can also take a bus to Liptons Seat (get off at Haputale) and take a tuk tuk from there. The view from the top by Lipton's statue is pretty and shows off tea plantations in every direction. You can either walk back down to the entrance (about 8km) to catch the bus or meet your ride or simply ride back in your tuk tuk once you are done looking around. There are places along the way (walking or riding) where you can look around and wander a bit through the rows of tea plants. Go early - the fog/mist rolled in around 9:30 am and I was told it can get bad enough later in the day that driving is difficult. Given those roads that is not a risk I'd ever want to take! Also people often take pictures of the tea ladies working but remember - they are paid the equivalent of less than $3 usd a day and they are not animals in a zoo who are performing for your entertainment.","January 22, 2019",0.0,0.0

The place is around 15km away from Haputale. You can take the route via Dambetenna estate. You can drive your own vehicle (Heavy vehicles are not allowed) all the way to the top without any issue. The only thing is the road is very narrow & very difficult to cross over with a vehicle coming from opposite direction. On the top parking space is available for few vehicles. If you wish to use public transport service you can find a bus to Lipton Seat from Haputale.(Haputale - Bandara Eliya) You are lucky if you can take that direct bus since the service is not frequent. If it feels hard to find the bus simply ask a local. They are very friendly. They helped us a lot when we were visiting this area. If the bus is not available simply take the bus Bandarawela - Dambetenna which is running via Haputale. It will take you up to Dambetenna tea factory. For the rest you can hire a taxi or small buses running occasionally. If you prefer walking to the destination you have to walk about 8km. But walking may make you very tired as you have to climb up from the beginning to the end. If you chose hiring a taxi you can go to the top directly while if you chose bus you have to walk around 2km to reach the destination. You are required to buy tickets (for yourselves & vehicles)  at the entrance gate and the ticket is valid only for issued day. On the top there is a small shop & you can buy small things like water bottles, snacks from there. And a statue of Thomas Lipton is sitting on a bench is there & you can take photographs with him. Just above the small shop mentioned earlier there is a viewing deck & from there you can take a clear look around without any disturbance from trees. It is said to be that if there is no mist then we can see Several districts from here & Hambontota harbour too. But When I visit there there were some mist in some area. For me some mountains & few lakes were visible on one side. But the thing is I couldn't recognize any of those and any districts from there. :) Don't forget your camera when you visit there. You can have a huge collection of good shots. If you hope to return by bus don't forget to ask about the times of return buses while going up. Otherwise you may have to waste your time waiting for a bus.","January 15, 2019",0.0,0.0

It’s a good 1.5 hour drive up mountain twisty roads to get there so bear that in mind if you want to go. Not a great route if you get car sick. Driver suggested we leave at 5.30-6 am in order to get there and make assent before mist rolled in and obscured the views. However, we are not early risers (family with teenagers!) and we hate missing our nice hotel breakfasts (a packed one is never the same!) especially when you pay a premium to stay somewhere. We were staying at 98 Acres and views from the restaurant there are amazing in themselves and probably the best breakfast we’ve had on our trip to Sri Lanka to date so not to be missed! We ended up leaving hotel around 9.30 and got up to the tea factory around 11.15. We then opted to take the rest of the route by tuk tuk. We needed 2 and they were SLR1000 each for the round trip. I did a bit of research beforehand and the average price is somewhere between 800-1500 rupees for a return tuk tuk depending on your negotiating skills and how busy it is. Some people were walking up but my guess is it would take you 45-60 mins to walk up. It’s not a difficult walk, you just follow the road as it winds up the mountain. Tuk tuk was much more fun though! It took about 15-20 mins to get to the top. It was a great way to make the assent and look out at the landscape and beautiful views. Once near the top you need to lay a further fee at a gate of 100 rupees per person to go right to the top. I’m sure the views are great but it was heavy with mist at the top, we couldn’t see much if the views. It was still nice up there though and we had a cup of tea and a few snacks that were brought out by a few plantation workers whilst we were up there (tbh I wasn’t keen on drinking or eating anything due to hygiene but we thought we should  just go with it.....I’m glad we did as in end it was only 400 rupees and it doesn’t really matter if you drink or eat any of it). The best thing about the trip was the fun tuk tuk ride which the kids loved. It doesn’t matter what time of the day you go for that, but if you’re desperate for views the go early. The most interesting ting for me was seeing the workers village and the tea plantation itself, and that’s all around where you pick up the tuk tuk to go up to the top viewing point.","August 3, 2018",0.0,0.0

The drive to get to Lipton’s Seat is what was the most amazing for us as we had left it too late and it was cloudy by the time we arrived at the top. The drive up the windy road through the tea fields was just amazing. We were cheered on by local school kids and saw the women in the fields picking the tea. We arrived at Lipton's seat around lunchtime the tea pickers were having their break and congregating at the view point. They asked if we wanted to take their picture for a fee. We declined. We were disappointed with ourselves for forgetting to take biros/pens with us as loads of the kids were asking for school pens. Lipton's Seat is ticketed and you have to pay per person and vehicle to access the view point. There is a local cafe at the top. Beware that at the moment there are construction works at the seat where he is sat. Top tip: Get there at sunrise to get clear views!

Public transport available upto Dambetenne Tea Factory where its advisable to leave even a private vehicle there as the estate road is too narrow for two vehicles to pass. Best is to either on foot or by taking a tuk tuk from there for around Rs. 800 both ways. We found a nice guy called Siva who was a very friendly person from whom we got much information. The tea estate seems to have an extent of about 3300 hectares. The view all the way up was fantastic and scary too at moments.

Lipton’s Seat has tremendous views of the surrounding tea plantations. I recommend going early in the morning (7am to 10am) as that’s when it’s most clear. We had a driver take us up as the walk is quite long (5.5km+). If a driver is not an option, a tuk tuk can take you up. Beyond the views, keep an eye out for the local plantation workers - a true indication of the region’s culture and economic livelihood.","February 15, 2018",0.0,0.0

Due to mist we couldn't see much but as i heard from locals that doesnt happen often. If you are in this area make sure to go there before 5 am to watch the sunrise. If you are travelling by your own vehicle a quick advice i would like to give to others is that they need to keep their vehicles near dabethanna team factory and take a tuk tuk from their. Reason behind this is that the road is soo small for two vehicles and some times you might need to reverse 300m to find a spot for the other vehicle to cross.,"September 3, 2017",0.0,0.0

However, we had our hearts set on the walk - the pivotal reason we were visiting Haputale - and so decided to hike up the next morning anyway. We left the guesthouse around 6am and had a beautiful two and a half hour hike to Lipton's seat. We passed a small lake, walked through cloud forest and past lush tea plantations. There are signs along the way with words of wisdom about environmental issues and protecting the planet as well as a count down towards lipton's seat. The views going up were different to any that we have ever encountered and it has been our favourite hike in Sri Lanka so far.

At the top we were greeted with tea, toffee, rotti and corn cakes: so delicious and just what we fancied after the hike. The views are stunning, however the mist and clouds surround the view point from around 8:30am onwards, so try aim to be there before. At the top you can get a tuktuk back down, or walk to the tea factory where there are plenty more tuktuks willing to take you back into town.","May 9, 2017",0.0,0.0

We stayed at a guesthouse in Haputale and got a tuk tuk at 6am to the Dambatenne tea factory (700 rupees around 30min journey). From there we followed the winding road up to liptons seat. It's a very easy 7km walk up and I would definitely recommend walking rather than getting a tuk tuk to the top if you have time! A tuk tuk straight to the top costs around 1000rupees apparently. For the way up we followed the gentle winding road but on the way down we took the steeper routes straight down the tea plantation which is definitely faster (would make for a very strenuous hike up hill though). It's a 50 rupees entrance fee to enter the last part of the walk to get to liptons seat. The views through the tea plantation are absolutely stunning, we were lucky to go on a sunny day. It took us about an hour and a half to get to the top and we stopped for a cup of tea, there's a hut selling tea and rottis with lots of local Sri Lankan guys trying to get you to eat there. Views at the top are also amazing but make sure to get there early as the fog rolls in mid morning.

The advice was to get a taxi to drop us off at the top, walk the 7 kilometres downhill through the tea plantations and catch a bus back to Haputale from Dambatenne which we duly did; we were not disappointed. We got to the top by 06.00 which was plenty of time to settle down and wait for the sun to rise. At that time of the morning, and at that height, it gets pretty cold so I definitely recommend a fleece and windproof. The views are stunning but of course are totally dependant on the weather. We were lucky and had great 360 degree panoramic views; absolutely stunning and an experience that will stay with us forever. At the top you can get hot tea and roti freshly cooked over a wood fire which was very welcome after our early morning start. The walk downhill (I note some reviewers walked up as well as down - I consider myself to be a strong walker and I wouldn't have liked to have done that so hats off to them!) is equally enjoyable. The incredible views of the summit are gradually replaced by rolling tea plantations and tea planters villages until finally the tea factory at Dambatenna comes into view. All in all a wonderful experience although, of course, totally dependant on the weather. Here's wishing you good luck on the weather front when you get the chance to visit Lipton's Seat.","February 17, 2017",0.0,0.0

The route winds through the tea fields and the little districts where the workers live and every person greets you with a friendly smile and a wave. It took us about 1.5hr to get to the top at a leisurely pace and were met with some incredible views. We had to pay 50lkr each to proceed to the top and it looked like any vehicles required 100lkr. We then decided to walk all the way back to Haputale which was about 9-10km from the tea factory. This walk is not too arduous as it's fairly flat but can be tiring in the afternoon sun. NOTE: There are a lot of local kids on the way to Liptons seat and walk to Haputale who ask for the obligatory sweet/cookie etc.but also ask for school pens.

The tea factory is fascinating, much cheaper value than other more famous and touristy venues- it cost up 500 rupees per person.

Recommend to park your vehicle by the Dambetenna Tea factory premises & hop in to  a tuk tuk by the park. The local boys are pretty knowledgeable about the   site. Through a tiny little windy road you could reach the peak. Once you reach the Lipton's seat you will not believe your eyes. This has been the location where Mr.Thomas Lipton has done his surveying for Tea planting. You could see five Provinces in Sri Lanka from the location.

You can see and talk to the workers along the walk. In the end of the walk you can visit and enter the factory for only 250 rp per person.,"May 14, 2016",0.0,0.0

The drive up (yes, if you have a car and a chauffeur, its recommended that you drive up), is spectacular as we were treated to beautiful vistas of tea plantation and blue tinged mountains. We got to the top at about 10am and as most travellers had commented, the mist prevented us from enjoying one part of the view. The locals say that 5am to 8am would be the best time really but that would have been too early for us. However, the other non-misty side was gorgeous as well, so we stayed and enjoyed the beauty and greenery, while sharing a cuppa with Sir Lipton! I did see some people trekking down the tea plantations. Am not sure how practical that is but our guide said that there is a really high chance of leeches sticking to you if you take that path. So I would choose to be less adventurous and take a tuk tuk or a car up and down Lipton's Seat. This is a definite highlight of our Sri Lankan trip and its highly recommended.","May 8, 2016",0.0,0.0

We read reviews on TripAdvisor saying that being on top at 9 o'clock is fine. Well, from our experience I disagree. It is way too late. We took the earliest train from Ella leaving at 6.40am. We arrived in Haputale at 7.40am. The train cost 25rs, third class, no reservation. From Haputale we rushed to Lipton's Seat with a tuk tuk (about 30 mins trip, 800rs). When we reached the top the whole place was already covered with fog. I therefore recommend to spend the night before in or near Haputale and get a tuk tuk aiming to reach Lipton's Seat for no later than 7am. Entrance fee is 50rs.

I searched online that could be Rs.800 but just didn't wanna bother to walk around and ask the price. So just deal. The tuk tuk driver dropped us off in front of the gate instead to the top of the Lipton's Seat. I thought he just cheated. But as the sun was rising, he brought us into the tea field and had a very good place and aspect to see the sunrise! He was correct as Lipton's Seat is not exactly facing the East. After watching sunrise, I and my friend walked to Lipton's Seat, it was about 1km from the gate, around 15 mins walk. Of course there are plenty of shortcut in the tea field, you could go up and down faster if you could find it. If not, just follow the main road. It was around 7am when we arrived Lipton's Seat, the view was amazing. The store at the top opened at 730 or 8am, can't remember. We haven't ordered anything, the staff just told us to take a seat, and he gave us 2 hot tea and 3-4 roti. Rs200 in total. We walked down to the Lipton factory afterwards, it took us about 2 hours. On the way I saw there was a bus heading to Lipton Seat. I thought it was a tour bus because I didn't see any info of any bus directly goes to Lipton's Seat from Haputale. After we arrived the factory, we caught the bus which was from the Lipton's Seat. It was Rs35-40/ person, and dropped off at the Haputale town centre. I asked the staff who collected money that if the bus headed directly to the top of Lipton's Seat. And he said yes. The schedule was 30min an interval. I dropped off at 9:50 and he told me the next bus was 10:30 Hope the info could help.","April 26, 2016",0.0,0.0

Then we walked down to the Dambatenne factory through the tea gardens by way of the paths that cut through them. It was a lovely walk with fantastic views. We didn't visit the factory as we'd been to Uve Halpewatte.  Just next to the bus stop there's a little shop where you can get a cup of tea.  The shopkeeper is very chatty and we spent a nice half hour with him.  Then we got the bus back to Haputale (fare about 30/-). This was a really great trip.,"March 26, 2016",0.0,0.0

The walk is quite easy and leisurely and you have some really nice views on the way. We actually agreed a return price to the bottom but instead paid him less and walked back ourselves to enjoy the view. Nice little cafe at the top where you can have a cup of tea (I assume Liptons) and look out over all the tea plantations. Also really easy and cheap to travel to via bus, although as always the local may deceive you about the public transport in order for you to pay far more in their mode of transportation.

On our opinion, In Haputale you will not find a better place).","March 24, 2016",0.0,0.0

You have to buy tickets atvtwo places, one when you enter to dambetenne estate and another one from the entrance gate for the road to lipton's seat. Roads are repairing at the moment when we went there. So as a result of it, it takes more time to pass that 12kms. Strongly advice you to travel with the vehicle with 4WD. and be careful when you pass those tight bends. Talking about the place, the place was awesome. Nice climate.
