If you are coming from Colombo, the Google maps will direct you to turn from the Kalugala junction. But since that was not in particular good conditon about a year back, we decided to take the more familiar route of Carolina - Norton - Wanarajah road on to Norton Bridge, then Norton - Maskeliya road from where you get a turn off to Laxapana. Once you opt to turn off to Carolina - Norton - Wanarajah road, Google maps will show this alternate route. There are two entry points (both marked on the google maps), one to the bottom of the falls and another to the top of the falls. You will come across the access to upper entry point first if you coming from Norton Bridge side. But we opted to take the lower entry point first. There is a bit of room to park on the side of the road and a couple of shops. (A place called ""Fall Rest"" even had a clean washroom). In between two shops there is a entry point from which you have to climb a flight of steps. It's not a straight climb down, there are twists and turns (and certain turns leads to houses) but there will always be people around to ask which way to turn. The steps were in relatively good conditon. I read in some reviews that there were 500 steps. We didn't count and didn't feel there were that many but they were built quite high and were covered in moss, so it did take quite a while for us to climb down, about 20 mts or so. Climbing back up was another story ;) Plus even though the weather was cool, humidity was probably high due to imminent rain and we were sweating buckets!!! But...... it was all so worth it!!!! The falls was as majestic and breathtaking as it looked in pictures!!!. Plus it was a working day, so we had the place to ourselves for the most part. It was so calm, quiet and beautiful we spent close to an hour there just enjoying the spectacle. The steps lead you to a point a little away from the exact point where the falls ""hits the ground"". For that, it seemed you had to do a little more adventurous climb over some rocks, which we opted to skip. There is a reservoir and two power stations upstream, so the water levels are controlled. But there was a decent amount when we went. Not sure whether you can swim or bath. But if you are planning to, do take advice from locals in advance. Once we climbed back up we went back to the upper entry point which was about 700 meters more towards Norton Bridge side. There was no specific parking space. And the entry point was almost covered from overgrown tall grass. But the map location is accurate and it's right opposite a gate marked ""Jayabima Estate"". From there you have to climb down about 20-30 steps. We were told there are leeches in the rainy season but not in August since it's not exactly the rainy season. This was true for the lower entry point....  but it was drizzling by the time we went to the upper point and the place was crawling with leeches!. Plus the rocks were already wet so it didnt seem safe to move closer to the falls either. So we literally made a run for it back to the top! In dry weather it would have been an awesome experience. (But always speak to the locals first on whether there could be a change in water levels etc.) We were also told by the locals that the ""tourist season"" for the waterfall coincide with the season for Adam's Peak, since this is situated somewhat closer to the route to Adam's Peak and it would also be the dry season for this area well.","August 19, 2024",0.0,0.0

And the location and the surrounding is arguably the finest. To get the experience to the full, one must walk, all the way from the 4th mile post. It's a 2km walk right under the mysterious, foreboding and yet majestic Seven Virgins Range.Almost the entire stretch is with very limited human presence, but it's safe. Village folks and Tea community you have here do not bite!. Best to begin the walk as early as possible.Walk and and the decent to the falls may need about 90 minutes so better begin around 8am. Falls look best at morning before 11am, before the million boulders between you and the falls get hotter. Decent is through the village down along 500 or so paved steps, The little town at the start of the decent has a single restaurant with very good washroom.The charge is Rs 50 for use but you might need it. Talk to the owner and he would open up on his first hand experience at seeing the aircraft tragedy in 1974- then the one with biggest loss of life. PLEASE BRING BACK EVERYTHING YOU TAKE. Bring it all the way home. Laxapana is still spared from plastic pollution .Let's keep it that way.","February 7, 2024",0.0,0.0

We did not take the Sripada turn near 43rd km post, as condition of that road is not supposed to be good. We took the Sripada rurn after arround 5km from Ginigathhena. We went there in February which is dry month so there was no leaches. Waterfall may not at its fullest due to dry season but safe. There are two directions to the waterfall, one to the top of the fall and other one to the bottom of the fall. We didn't go to top of the fall as we had kids and though its not safe. We went to the bottom of the fall. For that we had to climbdown arround 1.5km. There are cement steps up to the bottom. But climbing up was bit tiring. (Altogether I did bit more than 4600 foot steps both the ways down and up) Before climbing down better get the information about water level from the shop owners nearby as if dam opens water level can be riseup & become dangerous. We actually left Colombo in the morning arround 5.30 am and reached there arround 9.30 -10 am for the breackfast. We had a morning picnic there. Attraction time depends on how fast people can climb down and up and how much time they want to spend there.","March 2, 2021",0.0,0.0

If you use the google maps it shows the road to the top. From top the path is having concrete steps but it is covered up by the plants and not well maintained and hard to see the pathway from the main road also. you have to walk like 100m from the main road to see the top of the fall. We visited in July and the water was average and it was a beautiful scenery. if you want to have a much more closer look you should visit the fall from the bottom. you have to go ahead like 750m from the main road and you will find small coffee shop from there you have to walk about 750m long step pathway. and must say it's worth the walking. you can have an incredible view of the fall. not an easy visiting if you are not much physically active but still you can make it.,"August 8, 2019",0.0,0.0

Climb down 300 meters by foot cemented steps with a hand rail makes the walk easy. It is well worth the effort at the sight of the stunning single drop from 129 meters above. Nice place to cool off. Does not have the basic facilities for camping though a visit is fully worth. You can have a nice cup of Tea on your way back at the small hotel even some hot food if you pre order before going down towards the fall. On the return one can either take the route to Kithulgala thus saving nearly 15km if you are returning to Colombo or you can proceed to Dehiowita via Deraniyagala which saves a few more kilometers.,"January 28, 2019",0.0,0.0
