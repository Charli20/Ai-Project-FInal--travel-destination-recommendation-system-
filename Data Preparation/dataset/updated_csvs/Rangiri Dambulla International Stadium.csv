We paid about £15 per ticket which gave us nice views but it was lacking in atmosphere.  Didn't help it was a 'dry' ground that day.  Might be tempted to go for a cheaper seat where there were other people nearby as a number of seats near us were empty so it was a bit meh from a 'watching SL play cricket in SL' perspective.  The areas with cheaper seats were full which is how I wanted to watch the game.,"August 23, 2018",0.0,0.0

You have to buy a ticket to watch matches being played on schedules. Rangiri Dambulla Cricket Stadium is located not far away from the city centre. It is located in a really beautiful place, adjacent to a tank (lake) and surrounded by the wonderful natural countryside of this famous town with its Golden Temple. The plan when building it, was for it to stage cricket matches at times of the year when the south of the country is experiencing monsoon rains and therefore it is located in the dry zone of Sri Lanka where rainfall is less. It seems that there are not a lot of matches played there but the place is fascinating for its purpose and beautiful location. A guard let us go to the right to the top where cameramen are stationed to have a most beautiful sight of the stadium and the surrounding lake and hills. There was cool breeze and we were made comfortable. The road which leads to the ground from Kurunugala is completed its widening and well attended which would make it easier to travel to this place. This is an international stadium well maintained and very nice to see. It is a beautiful Cricket Ground and near a natural lake which is also refreshing. Unfortunately not many matches are played here. The grandstand gives a great view of the game. If possible must go only when there is a match and I witnessed a match and what an atmosphere. The whole ground is full of noisy supporters with bands playing some songs interludes and even people sing too. Go and enjoy a match when it is played and you can check the schedules when a foreign cricket team tours Sri Lanka.","June 27, 2018",0.0,0.0

Firstly, our Driver Nanditha Perera was a Gem. He was kind, considerate and knowledgeable, even putting up with my barrage of questions.! We stayed at the Cinnamon Lodge which was very pleasant and went on a Safari, the highlight of which was seeing an Elephant charging one of the jeeps, just glad it wasn't ours! Our next Hotel in Kandy wasn't quite such a success as it was high on a hill and we were at the mercy of the Topaz Hotel, which was very much a tourist trap, they even had a '60's wine list, buy the staff were quite lovely ,as were all the staff we meet. The trip through the Mountain on a train, was something to remember and the Hill Club was fab with lots of old world charm(even a door for the Ladies to enter the club) It was also nice to have a proper service as I was getting buffeted out! The Spice Garden was another highlight, very interesting. The Grand Udawalawe Hotel was a real treat, quite spectacular. Our final Hotel was The Sands, nothing sing about, but it served the purpose of an unwind from all the travelling. So.....Sri Lank itself. It is like a balm in the countryside. The Buddha's and all the Temples were fascinating and such a rich cultural place. Asides from the Tuk-Tuk's and the richly painted lorries (many of which bore a legend that they were fully insured?) The maniacal Bus Drivers, cows wandering around, bicycles everywhere, life was very peaceful, the most noise came from the Monkey's. The Town's were a little crazy, but thanks to our fabulous Nan, we felt very safe, his driving skills were fantastic. The other thing that really struck, was how clean it was, no litter here. Smiling children in immaculate white School clothes, waved cheerily at us all over the place, but go soon, I fear that things will change, which will be very sad. I so enjoyed all the lovely people I meet and Yes I would go back!","April 30, 2015",0.0,0.0

We reached in the afternoon and after an hour, we left for local sight seeing. We were interested to see the Dambulla International Cricket Stadium. Our Tour Guide took us there. The Stadium is situated in the Central Province, close to Dambulla on a 60 acres land.      Wow..It was a big stadium having a seating capacity of 30,000. As the site of the Stadium is leased from the Rangiri Dambulla Temple, it is being known as ""Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium"". As we could see, the stadium was built overlooking the Dambulla Tank (reservoir) and the Dambulla Rock. We were told by our Tour Guide that this stadium was built in a record time of 167 days. We were also told that the Inaugural One Day International (ODI) match was played between Sri Lanka and England in March 2001. Though no match was being played at the time of our visit, we were not allowed inside the stadium. We just had a look from outside and satisfied for having visited a stadium in Sri Lanka.","February 13, 2015",0.0,0.0

The main advantage to cricket lovers is the easy access to the location, situated just next to the busy main road which has plenty of public transport facilities. The rather long name of the stadium is etched in beautifully carved granite slabs at the entrance. Beyond that lies shady trees and plenty of open spaces for parking. The ground itself is large and is well maintained. The Score board is quite big and the multi story pavilion, which also houses air conditioned cubicles, is comfortable, . View from the pavilion is picturesque as the surrounding area is covered with lush green vegetation with distant mountain ranges and the Ibbankatuwa tank adorning the back ground. The cool breeze across the lake is soothing especially during the dry season when the weather is hot. Only a few matches have been played during the last few years, but the venue has seen a rise in game allocation since recently, mainly due the massive crowds that throng the stadium. An area to improve is the flood lights as they need an upgrade to cater to day / night matches. Therefore currently, only day time games are played. Nevertheless, whenever there are international matches, people enjoy the event to the fullest. For those needing overnight accomodation, there are plenty of world class hotels close by with a wide choice, as the city of Dambulla is an established tourist destination which connects several major cities and tourist destinations. The popularity of the ground is increasing with each tour by a test playing nation to Sri Lanka. Often, there have been instances where a noticeable number of cricket fans having to be turned back due to the stadium beeng filled to full capacity.","October 23, 2014",0.0,0.0
