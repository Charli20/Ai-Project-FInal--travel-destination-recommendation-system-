At the onset of the Coronavirus lockdown it was less crowded.  This gave me the opportunity to capture the beauty of the temple by visiting it twice, once in the morning on 16th and again in the evening on 18th March 2020.  Some of these photographs are included with this narrative. Visitors need to remove their shoes at the entrance to the temple.  Being a place of worship, there is no entrance fee for locals.  The tourists over 12 years are charged Rs 400 (USD 2.25) per person.  The temple is open to the public from 0530 until 2200 hrs.  The main attractions at the temple are an Image House, Samadhi statue and Stupa, Atavisi Hall, Bo tree, imitation of Indonesian Borobudur monument, museum, relic chamber, library as well as alms and educational halls.  A three storeyed building houses priests and includes rooms that provide space for their education at the monastic college (pirivena). I spent about two hours within the temple on the 16th.  As I was coming out at about ten o’clock in the morning, I was lucky and fortunate to witness the fascinating spectacle of the temple elephant coming in through the entrance with a lotus flower atop its raised trunk.  It walked in, attended by the mahout, walked up through the temple courtyard up to the Samadhi Buddha statue and paid homage, kneeling and prostrating itself on all fours and placing the flower gently on the offer table!  Though the elephant had some chains around its neck, it walked with a bouncing gait and went away presumably for its daily walk on the streets around the temple.  It was an unusual and a spectacular sight that I witnessed that morning!  I am an animal lover and was glad to see that the elephant was not forced in anyway to perform this act – though it must have been trained to do that ritual! My first stop was the Image House or Viharaya.  A large sized seated buddha statue in meditation is the central attraction within.  Flanked are many other statues and statuettes of heavenly beings as well as paintings related to Buddhist narratives and stories all decorated in golden yellow. The white Samadhi statue, chiselled out of white jade, was my next stop.  The statue sits in an intricately sculpted stone house flanked by two elephant tusks.  It is at the offer table here, that I later saw the temple elephant placing the lotus flower.  Behind the Samadhi statue is the white domed stupa. Intricately decorated Ata Visi Hall houses 28 buddha statues.  This was closed at the time of my visit although I managed to capture a few photos through the gaps in between the door bars. The bo-tree is at the upper level.  This is one of the key items in Buddhist worship.  Buddha is reputed to have attained enlightenment under a bo-tree.  At the upper level also are an alms hall for priests and an educational hall for the public to listen to Buddhist preachings by priests. Within the relic chamber are housed relics of Buddha and some of his disciples.  A large collection of objects of historical, cultural and religious significance are housed in the museum that is entirely filled with objects.  These include vast arrays of Buddhist artefacts, old coins, statues, ola-leaf writings, jewellery and many others   Though not within the museum, there is an array of vintage cars, watches, clocks and other mechanical equipment.  An imitation from the Borobudur temple in Indonesia depicting an array of buddha statues on stacked platforms, sits behind the relic chamber.  The Seema Malaka on the adjoining Beira lake too is part of this temple, although TripAdvisor provides it a separate listing. The Navam Perahera, a colourful pageant is held annually in February.  This grand spectacle of hundreds of dressed up and costumed elephants together with many troupes of dancers, drummers and other performers touring in procession is watched by tourists and visitors perched on multi-level stages that are erected along the roads. The temple contributes to and carries out several community projects too.  Among these are vocational training centres, homes for abandoned and street children, homes for the elderly as well as publication of Buddhist literature. The temple swarms with tourists and devotees throughout the day.  Early morning is the best time to avoid the crowds.  It is unbelievably crowded on Sundays, Public Holidays and especially on poya days when devotees throng the temple.","May 4, 2020",0.0,0.0

Yesterday, I visited Gangaramaya buddhist temple. It is indeed a beautiful place with an amazing history behind it. Nonetheless its glory is greatly undermined as in the parking just opposite the temple, on a small patch of land, people keep an elephant that is chained. I can't understand what could possibly be the reason of keeping such a great wild animal in the middle of Colombo, chained and without space to move, and as much as I respect the buddhist culture and its traditions, I really feel the call to do something about this. Apparently the elephant has been chained there for 20 years! I can't even imagine this in the 21st century when we know how precious are these animals, and Sri Lanka has so many elephant orphanages. Apparently again, as people at the temple did not want to talk to me about the elephant as if it was some kind of a secret, they use the elephant for sacred services at the temple. The temple itself is full of animal relics, such as tusks, ivory statues, elephant legs, head and even a tail. There is also a huge stuffed elephant called Raja, which had its tusks growing in a peculiar way and was considered sacred. Is this the way to protect these majestic animals of Sri Lanka? Surely not.

Aside from that this temple is regarded as the most important in town. However to my surprise I have realized there are two Gangaramaya temples...let's say the old one and the new one. They are very close to each other but the latter has been built on a city lake. It is almost done but there are still works in progress. The entrance ticket costs 300 rupees. Once I arrived there by chance I asked at the entrance if that was Gangaramaya temple and I was told yes. After my visit I was kinda confused as what I saw didn't match the pictures I saw on the Internet. This is why I asked a passerby where Gangaramaya temple was. He told me the real temple is not the one on the lake but 200 or 300 meters from the new one. The entrance fee for the real Gangaramaya temple is still 300 hundred rupees. With a total of 600 rupees you can visit the both of them. Also in the old temple there are works in progress at the time of my writing. However you can pleasantly enjoy both the new and the old temple.,"February 16, 2019",0.0,0.0
