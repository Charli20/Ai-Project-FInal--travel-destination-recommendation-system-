These beautiful animals were chained in the pens so tight they could hardly move. It was then recommended we go see the elephants being bathed. Start time was 2pm we arrived at 1.45 had a lovely vantage point from a restaurant. What we witnessed was so distressing I wish we hadn’t bothered. The elephants arrived at 1.45 and were chained underwater by front and back leg on the same side which meant they couldn’t move, they couldn’t even lift their legs. They were then shouted at, hit and poked with a cane to make them lie down, one elephant kept trying to get back up but was unable to because the chains were so tight. When the public came to view they couldn’t see the chains so proceeded to lie or sit on the elephants to get pictures taken. I can honestly say this is the worst experience of cruelty I have ever experienced. If you have a conscience I would not visit. I’ll have a lasting memory of this place for all the wrong reasons.","December 30, 2025",0.0,0.0

We spend a couple of hours in the morning cleaning the stalls and refreshing the elephants food supplies (50kg per elephant), then helped out with the public elephant feeding. A couple of hours off over the middle of the day and then spent time bathing the elephants at the river from 2-4pm before following them back up the street and settling them for the night. We saw some reviews complaining that the elephants were chained- yes some are - the males particularly when they are in musk - wanting to mate and overnight. We understood the rationale for this - to protect themselves and each other at night - they all had their own stalls with plenty of food, but we did see neighbours trying to steal food from each other. Also when they are in musk they are more unpredictable. These are huge animals and so on occasions the public do need to be protected from potential risks. We only saw amazing care and attention given to the elephants from the staff, yes there is some shouting ….. think trying to get a load of teenagers off the playing field. The mahouts do carry long sticks with a hook - an ankush, again this is to guide the elephants - they hook the hook over the elephants ears to direct them. We never saw them being ill treated with the ankush. The public can pay to bath the elephants and we did this as part of our volunteering - the elephants did seem to enjoy this and were so relaxed during the experience. Most of these elephants are working elephants who have been rescued and are used to direction and work. We never saw any riding of the elephants by the public at all. We were very impressed with how clean everything was behind the scenes and how the staff really cared for the elephants. We saw the vets in action as well as the mahouts caring for their particular elephants. Everyone does need to remember that these are enormous animals and it is a privilege to see them close up, but it isn’t in the wild and it isn’t a zoo. The animals here are well cared for, have spaces to roam around and head down to the river each day where they freely wander and play in the water. We also saw some complaints about the cost of visiting, especially as a foreigner.  When we were there there were 65 elephants, needing circa 50kg of food each day and with over 200 staff working there. All these costs occur 255 days a year irrespective of the visitor numbers. Consider how much you would have to pay for such an amazing experience in your home countries. We felt the price was very fair.","November 1, 2025",0.0,0.0

The animals are kept further above in enclosures that are far too small for such a large herd, except for the bathing staging sent for tourists. Those who know their way around will notice that about 90% of animals no longer have tail tassels, because they lose them in the constant wrangling in the too small gates. In addition, you can even breed, because with the cute baby elephants you can make an extra mark: Tourists are allowed to bottle-feed them....not a single elephant is released here, on the contrary, it is pure money making, the entrance fees are hefty.

My husband and I had visited Pinnewala about 16years ago. We had very fond memories of the place and were keen to return. I wish we hadn't. We visited after having experienced a safari drive at Minneriya National Park. Pinnewala has changed significantly.  We arrived late afternoon and headed straight to the river to see the elephants bathe. There must have been about 20 elephants in the river. The staff in green t-shirts advised you to stand in specific spots to pose with the elephants. They are clearly trained to command: lots of trunks came up and we were encouraged to buy small bags of guavas to feed them. The staff took my phone and snapped LOTS of photos of us, as well as another person's child. The elephants were restrained back by the river by a male with a long stick and a metal prod at the top. They were pushed back about 2-3times in the 20mins we were there. There was also a staff member directing a huge hose of cooling river water across the elephants backs. As soon as the staff gave my phone back, he demanded a tip. Then he kept asking for tips for his colleagues, before telling me that I should tip more. We took our time to head back to the park. The entire area becomes like a ghost town as soon as the elephants have walked through. We entered the park, which had jurassic park/ empty zoo vibes. Lots of lovely green fields and trees....... .....And all of the elephants that we saw were all chained. About 20 of them. Most kept in individual pens-styled areas. They had grass in front of them to eat. But we saw a young elephant who just wouldn't eat, and instead kept shaking its head, rocking on its legs. Another female looked as though she was straining forwards against the chain on her back foot.  A (chained) bull was also shaking his head. We don't know what happened to the elephants who came to the river to bathe (as we didn't follow them back). Instead, we just saw lots who are chained up. Im not sure if any of them have the opportunity to roam around the gorgeous, lush fields that we saw. We noted that the Orphanage has a breeding programme. As my husband wryly pointed out, this helps ensure a positive amount of 'stock' to keep the venue going. Signposts proudly state that there are about 40females and just under 30 male elephants. We probably stayed less than an hour in the park. After all, how long can you just look at chained elephants who are quietly eating long grass that's put in front of them. All in all, not what we remember from Pinnewala all those years ago. If you want an ethical experience, seeing elephants roaming freely, then do your research. Sri Lanka has a lot of parks that will offer you a wonderful glimpse into their natural habitat and lives.","September 3, 2025",0.0,0.0

What we found was an over priced tourist trap which had elephants (only 2- as the rest were out on a festival in Kandy) responding the the whoops and sticks of owners. We spend £60 for a family of 4 and spent no longer than 15 minutes there. We were directed as soon as we arrived to the fruit stall to purchase a fruit basket ( 2000 rupees) an elephant was directed behind us opened its mouth and we put fruit in. Then he was directed for photos to toss up his trunk and perform. He then was directed to the ‘river’ probably about 100 metre away where the elephant on command laid down and my husband was directed to run him with a coconut husk. The elephant then got up and my husband was directed to stand underneath and have a ‘shower’. Again the elephant did as commanded and threw water.  The elephant handler then demanded a ‘tip’ for his service. My husband offered money and was told this was not enough. Luckily our tour guide stepped in and told us not to give him money as he was being rude. This made us feel really uncomfortable as the elephant handler had only been there for about 10 minutes and we thought we were being kind. Our tour guide explained that this happens a lot. Then basically we were directed to the exit. £60 down plus bits for the fruit and feeling completely heartbroken for the elephant and used by the organisation. This completely ruined our day and would NOT recommend to anyone. Sorry I know they need to raise money to support the elephants but this felt like a money spinning machine.","August 5, 2025",0.0,0.0

I paid 5,000 LKR (around $10 plus taxes), expecting something worthwhile, but unfortunately, there was very little to see. It felt like a waste of both time and money. The most frustrating part was the service at the ticket counter. The staff member – white a short, fair-skinned man – was extremely rude and unprofessional. When I asked a simple question, he responded in a very disrespectful manner. Customer service should be a top priority, especially in a place that depends on tourism. I also found it unfair that locals pay only 250 LKR for the same experience. I understand the difference in pricing, but it should at least reflect a better-managed experience for international visitors.

Established in 1975, this unique institution serves as a sanctuary for orphaned, injured, and abandoned elephants, offering them care and protection. Situated on a former coconut plantation along the Maha Oya River, Pinnawala provides a spacious environment for these majestic creatures. What began with just a handful of elephants has grown into the largest herd in captivity in the world. Visitors have the opportunity to witness the daily lives of these gentle giants, including their feeding times, where baby elephants are bottle-fed, and their refreshing baths in the river, a spectacle of playful interaction. While primarily a conservation center, Pinnawala has also become a significant tourist attraction, drawing both locals and international visitors eager to get up close with elephants. The income generated from tourism helps sustain the orphanage's operations and the well-being of its residents. The success of Pinnawala's captive breeding program has also contributed to its growth, with numerous births occurring within the sanctuary. These elephants, often orphaned due to human-wildlife conflict or natural incidents, find a safe haven here. Although not a completely natural habitat, Pinnawala strives to offer a life of care and security for these rescued animals, many of whom would not survive in the wild on their own.","May 5, 2025",0.0,0.0

Upon first glance, this place looked amazing. Walking up to see the elephants roaming was breathtakingly beautiful, & feeding them fruit was something I’d always dreamed about. But the happiness was short lived when I seen one being walked by a keeper with a big chain around his foot and draped over his neck. Along with the keeper holding a long stick with a sharp point on the end. I asked the guide why are there chains, to which he replied it’s because they’re newly rescued and need to go through a two month training programme to be able to integrate with the other elephants. How true that is I don’t know, but it was certainly upsetting to see him chained. And he wasn’t the only one either, there were a few that had chains around them. This made me feel uneasy as when the guide was ‘guiding’ the elephant down, it was poking him a few times and the elephant was crying out, heartbreaking to hear. When we went down to the river to watch them bathe, I was shocked that the river is bang smack in front of a hotel and there are hundreds of people, tourists & locals, all gawking at them. The way the keepers were shouting at the elephants and making at least three of them lie down in the water for photos was disgusting. And encouraging the people to basically climb and lean all over these animals. It was so upsetting to watch, at one point there were a family of at least 6x members climbing all over this one poor elephant for photos and the keepers were encouraging it!! When our guide asked if we were ready for our turn, we promptly refused and said it was disgusting how they were exploiting these animals. We refused to be part of it and asked to be taken back to our hotel. We didn’t even finish the rest of our tour as I was so annoyed and upset at the whole ordeal. They even had two elephants who were chained to rocks in the water, and the one was on his own & they wouldn’t let any of the others near him. One managed to get over and they looked like they were playing to me, but after about 20mins when one of the keepers noticed, (too busy encouraging people to climb over the others) he came running over and started shouting and chasing the elephant who wasn’t tied up away. The poor one in chains was just rocking back and forth shaking his head, clearly a sign of being distressed. When rounding up the elephants the keeps basically CHASE them and shout at them to get them altogether, and I even see one keeper RIDING one of the elephants out of the river. Honestly, we were so disappointed in this place. It’s all a tourist scam to make money & they’re just exploiting these animals. We were even told the elephants are chained at night so they can’t escape. Chained!! I wish I’d done more research into this place before we’d booked the tour, I’m ashamed we got sucked into the idea of seeing these beautiful animals under these circumstances. I would never recommend this to anyone.","April 21, 2025",0.0,0.0

Many visitors express concerns about elephants being chained or guided forcefully, while others criticize the very existence of an institution where elephants interact with humans. However, these critiques often lack an understanding of the difficult realities faced in Sri Lanka’s human-elephant coexistence. Yes, some elephants are sometimes chained—but is the alternative better? Some of these elephants are aggressive due to past trauma, and without restraints, they could pose serious danger to both humans and other elephants. Is the alternative to euthanize every elephant that becomes difficult to manage? When we visited Pinnawala, we made a conscious effort to see beyond the surface. We witnessed elephants bathing in the river, enjoying their meals, and interacting with caretakers who, for the most part, demonstrated genuine care and expertise. The orphanage is home to elephants that have been orphaned, injured in train accidents, or displaced due to conflicts with farmers. Without a facility like this, many of these elephants would not survive. Sri Lanka’s Buddhist culture places a strong emphasis on protecting life, which is why injured and disabled elephants are not euthanized as would have been in Europe. Instead, they are given a chance at life—sometimes with visible scars or disabilities that might make visitors uncomfortable, but which are a testament to the efforts made to save them. Pinnawala is government-run, and its existence plays a vital role in Sri Lanka’s broader conservation challenges. Hundreds of elephants die every year due to human-wildlife conflict, particularly through train accidents and electric fences near farmlands. Investing in facilities like Pinnawala helps not only the elephants but also the people who live alongside them by promoting education and sustainable solutions. Pinnawala has veterinarians that travel the country and help elephants in, an outside the orphanage. This can be assistance with landmine or train accidents in the country side of Sri Lanka. Without visitors there is no economy for this. Is Pinnawala perfect? No. Ethical concerns surrounding elephant tourism should always be addressed, and improvements should be encouraged where needed. But dismissing a place like this entirely ignores the complex reality of conservation in a developing country. The truth is, without tourism, there would be little economic incentive for local communities to protect elephants, and their habitats would suffer as a result. Our visit left us with a greater appreciation for the delicate balance between conservation, cultural traditions, and economic survival. Pinnawala is not a flawless sanctuary, but it is an important part of Sri Lanka’s elephant conservation efforts—one that deserves a more nuanced conversation rather than black-and-white judgment. Visit, spend some money, choose the activities that you feel are ethical and help them  become even better at helping these huge, amazing animals.","February 22, 2025",0.0,0.0

Online is a suggested length of stay of 3 hours. I'll get to that later. Once at the orphanage, we were amazed that the prices were so high. 15 euros admission per capita for an orphanage? Is that a donation? Well, we could still swallow that. Less than 60 seconds in the park, we were confronted with 2 options: 1. Walking with elephants for another massive fee. 2. Elephants feed for an extra charge. A single elephant was brought in and stuffed with bananas by a horde of tourists. Some would say “hey, they’re being fed what are you complaining about”. The elephants were forcibly held, beaten against the lower part of the trunk with horse mackerel, or pulled hard by the ear, while a horde of tourists took pleasure in watching a trained, fearful elephant and taking great photos. This so-called orphanage is an absolute nightmare for every animal lover and creature lover. Here money is made at the expense of the animals. This has nothing to do with animal love. Much worse, the animals are held here with chains under the guise of safety. A really disgusting place, I wouldn't recommend anyone in this world to go there.

This allowed us to see more than the people who come there as tourists for an afternoon. we also asked a lot of questions to the people; like why some elephants are chained and some are not. Answer was for the safety of animals and humans. Some elephants grow up in the area with the caretakers/have lived there for a long time, they are used to interaction with people (no different). However, animals that have been rescued from dire situations/found as orphans in nature still have to get used to the situation with people around them. this is understandable so far. but if you pay close attention you will see that some keepers are working underwater to poke the animal with their stick, to force them to lie down in the river for a bath. so this is not a voluntary choice of the elephant at that moment. it has to be for the photo that the tourists want to take while cuddling/washing the elephant. we saw elephants struggling and trumpeting in pain/anger. heartbreaking. The pricking is probably used to create respect/fear for the caregiver. Once abused enough, the elephant will listen without prodding, making it appear as if the animal is listening 'voluntarily'. in short the initiative of this project will be really good otherwise the animals might be orphaned/exploited for hard work. but the fact remains that where money can be made, people use power to get this money, including the government...","January 6, 2025",0.0,0.0

When you look on trip advisor you will see that this orphanage is listed as “not meeting animal welfare guidelines” do not ignore this. When I went there were elephants being made to pose for photos and be stroked in an attempt to make more money, despite the irony that most people would pay far more to see these animals in their natural habitat. Further to this, elephants were chained and would rock from side to side which they do when they are emotionally distressed. The elephants would be made to be bathed hundreds of times a day, far more than what they would like in the wild. Despite me raising concerns, of course my response was one of invalidation, denial, and gaslighting. You will be told things like “oh this happens so we can educate tourists and the elephants get the best treatment, you don’t know what you’re talking about”. Of course anyone would see through this veneer of denial so I urge any tourists thinking of visiting to remain trusting in what your own eyes show you. It is time that this organisation takes the opinions of others seriously and does not instead turn to self denial, anyone would pay far more and would leave amazing reviews if you allowed the elephants to be left alone and instead observed from afar (this is surely far more sustainable for the business, and less morally taxing). I see that the organisation often also comments on reviews to argue their point which is not only unprofessional, it only furthers the original point made that without self awareness, there will not be real change.","August 23, 2024",0.0,0.0

Even with children it is more worthwhile to go on a Safari (in the ZOO itself and inside the orphanage you will see a couple of elephants and animals). It used to be really an orphanage for elephants, now it just looks like an orphanage and de facto animal cruelty is hidden behind it. And no, I'm not an animal protector, but for the first time in my life I was bothered by how they treat those elephants. They are also tied up while swimming in the river, if they don't listen and don't stab them... In addition, they buzz you when you take pictures, they want extra money (even if you paid for the entrance fee, which 80% of the local residents don't have...). I was here with a person who was here 15 years ago, he wondered how many elephants have decreased.. Elephants who live to a great age.. We would not be surprised if they were dead.

But unlike in Udawalawe, they are not rehabilitated and released back to the wild. Hence, while they are a couple of chained bull elephants, most are semi domesticated and roams around in relative freedom. Google directions to the orphanage is accurate. You have to buy tickets for entry, a nominal amount for locals. I've visited the orphanage many years ago when the highlight of the place was  feeding sessions for the baby elephants. But sadly that is no longer open to visitors. (I can understand the reason after visiting Ufawalawe ;) But you can feed them fruits at an additional fee. The insta famous part of the visit is to see them being bathed in the Maha Oya. For this you have to cross the road from the orphanage and go down a side lane. (But make sure to carry the entry ticket you bought from the orphanage as there is a checking counter mid way in the lane.) The lane is full of tourist shops and ends in a set of pavilions build by the adjoining hotels. (So if you are staying at one of those hotels, and don't use the lane mentioned above for entry, you may not need a ticket. But better check with the hotel.) You can stand at the pavilions or there are tables to sit. You can even order food and drinks (This is handled by the same hotels). But as far we could see there was no requirement to buy food and drinks to sit at the tables set up by the hotels. The bathing takes place from 10.30 - 11 30 am in the morning and 2.30 - 3.30 pm in the afternoon. (But times may change depending on the weather.) If you want to bath the elephants you have to buy another ticket from the orphanage and show it to the mahouts at the river. All in all we spent an enojoyable two hours there. Bathing will concide with hot and humid weather, so the fact that you could sit in a shade and enjoy the spectacle was a great plus point.... There is also an open air zoo just before you reach the orphanage. We visited the place couple of years of ago just as it was starting out.","July 31, 2024",0.0,0.0

This unique sanctuary started with the noble mission of sheltering orphaned elephants. Over the years, it has transformed into a haven where these majestic creatures have grown and thrived. **Ticket Prices:** - Local Visitors: LKR 250 + 18% VAT - Foreign Tourists: USD 15.00 + 18% VAT **A Journey Through Time:** My first visit to Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage was 20 years ago. Back then, one of the highlights was watching the adorable baby elephants being fed with huge milk bottles – an incredibly heartwarming scene that drew many visitors. Unfortunately, on my latest visit, I discovered that this session is no longer available. The elephants have grown up, and the baby feeding sessions have been discontinued. **Current Attractions:** Despite the absence of baby feeding sessions, Pinnawala still offers a remarkable experience. Visitors can observe the elephants freely roaming within the sanctuary. Although direct contact with the elephants is not permitted, a designated hut for spectators provides a good vantage point to watch these magnificent animals up close. One of the enjoyable activities available is feeding the jumbo elephants with fruit plates, which can be purchased for a small fee. This interactive experience allows visitors to connect with the elephants in a unique and memorable way. **Elephant Bathing:** A visit to Pinnawala would be incomplete without witnessing the famous elephant bathing session. The elephants are led to a nearby river, where they indulge in a refreshing and playful bath. This activity not only offers great photo opportunities but also highlights the playful nature of these gentle giants.","July 13, 2024",0.0,0.0

We walked away without paying this time because they charged us 5200RS for foreigners, while locals paid significantly less. It was challenging to shop there too because vendors constantly tried to sell us something. We were stopped midway down the street to buy tickets to shop, making it difficult for other vendors to sell their products. During our previous visits, the streets were bustling with tourists, but now they're empty, and not in a good way. People would walk away rather than pay the inflated prices. A driver even told us that we could ride an elephant down the road for the same cost as the admission fee. It's absurd. The way foreigners are treated in Sri Lanka makes us reconsider coming back to these types of attractions. Other countries like Thailand and Taiwan treat foreigners with more respect, and their tourism industry is much better. The two-tier system currently in place in Sri Lanka is frustrating.","April 11, 2024",0.0,0.0

It seemed less crowded than almost a decade ago, but I can't recall if the initial trip was on a Saturday like the 2024 one. I am in two minds about this. On the positive side, one could view a small number of elephants in a reasonably sized field/paddock, and subsequently in the river.  Some were engaging in natural behaviours such as throwing mud over themselves. On the other hand, while it's understandable that what can be at times aggressive male ('bull') elephants need to be chained to walk though the street shared with souvenir shops to the river,  some maintain this is cruel. Given this is a Sri Lankan government facility, one wonders if there's mistreatment of elephants by handlers at times when the facility is closed to the public. The land area of 29 acres is probably way to small for about 70 elephants who in an open setting such as a mix of fields and forest would raam as I understand it up to 20 kilometres a day.  Notably, visitors could only see a small percentage of that number, which begs the question 'where are the rest?' Is this 'rehabilitation' or 'exploitation'?  And why can't the elephants gradually acquire the skills necessary to survive in the wild?  Is the answer to the latter that they'd be immediately rejected by any herds they encountered?","March 24, 2024",0.0,0.0

Some elephants were separated because they were currently undergoing medical treatment, for example.

We had already been on a wildlife safari at Kuwawela Park, which was mesmerising, seeing these splendid animals in their prime glory in the wildlife. So now, we went to Pinnawela to see the elephants from closeby (we were very excited). Upon arrival, we paid 15USD for the entrance ticket (it was 20 USD for a combi ticket with a visit to Pinnawela zoo included, but upon asking, the ticket seller himself admitted to the animals being in small cages, so we didn’t take the combi ticket). Our group finished the whole tour, and we made a vow not to judge, to keep an open mind. However, as the tour progressed, I kept feeling gradually worse and worse. To keep things objective, I asked the rangers a lot of questions, trying to gather as much information as possible. Still I couldn’t bring myself to feed, bathe, let alone sit on the backs of these magestic animals, so tragically turned to a state of starvation. I could count the ribs of several of the elephants, they kept hanging their tusks and mouths over the iron gates begging for food, picking up the tiniest piece of watermelon on the ground with a lot of sand, just to have something to eat. Two elephants were isolated in cages. Our guide told us they were kept in isolation and in chains on both their front and back feet for “a couple of weeks” to control them when they misbehaved. I asked whether this doesn’t hurt the animals mentally. He said they were given medicine when they were sick and besides, in the wild, the male elephants are also separated from the group. At the end of the tour, we allowed ourselves to fully ventilate to each other about how we felt. Angry and sad, for these innocent magestic animals we had witnessed bathing and walking in a big park from the jeep, and were now reduced to bone-thin “vehicals” (which is literally what our guide described them as) making parkinson-like shaking movements. Back and forth, back and forth some elephants wiggled their heads and body in the most unnatural-like way. When the rangers approached them with their stick (ankus or goad, proudly displayed in the orphanage), one could just see the fear in their movements, shaking and running away. I have been to many places in my life, but this was honestly the worst travel experience ever for me.

I really wanted to see baby/ young elephants recieving care in an ethical environment. On arrival to Pinnuwala a group of elephants were in the river having their daily wash, which was an amazing sight to see. They then moved one of the bigger girls out and encouraged the tourist to go and touch/feed them. Having taken my phone off me to capture the experience I was swept along and in total awe.  However, quickly they moved this elephant on back towards the orphanage. The staff then demanded money. I did give money to the guy who took the photos and then I was surrounded by others who were also demanding money. This was scary and was the start of my tainted bad experience. The rest of the elephants were then walked freely through the town back to the orphanage which was a magnificent sight. We then entered the orphanage which had 3 enclosures with about 12 elephants which were chained by one back leg.to a central pole within the enclosure. More than one was clearly distressed and rocking and swaying. When I asked why, I was told they were sick and needed medication regularly and this was the safest way to make sure they got well. This did not sit well with me but I accepted the answer. Then moving through the area, we came across a bull who was also chained. I asked the question again and was told that it was because he was a male and strong. I then asked if the others were chained too and the answer was yes!!! I then asked the guide to take me back to me hotel as I was not happy. How is this ethical? I'm sorry, but of you can walk a herd of elephants through the town without chains, why do they then need to be chained in their enclosures? This is not what I was paying to see, neither did I expect this from a so called ethical organisation. I was very disappointed/upset and angry with the whole experience and feel that I have paid to support very unethical practice for these poor animals.

Most of the workers were carrying a bull hook and were shouting and threatening the elephants. Most of the Elephants also had chains around their legs and necks. Next was the Elephant bathing, the Elephants were lead down a small street to a river where hundreds of people are stood gawping at them. I noticed some of the elephants were chained to rocks with not enough room to fully bathe themselves. I also noticed an elephant spending the whole time laying down in the water with a worker sat on top of it. A few of the elephants I saw were rocking and swaying which is a clear signal of distress. I left after this, it was an upsetting experience and clearly this place does not care about the welfare of the animals and it is all a money making scheme. Whilst I do not usually leave negative reviews for places I have left an honest review about my experience as had I have known the elephants would be chained, human interaction is encouraged and making the elephants perform for tourists then I would have never visited.

There is also an ATM near the entrance where the newly arrived foreign tourists can convert their home currency into Sri Lankan rupees. A fun place for kids to see elephants of all ages at close proximity. The entry fee is nominal and the place well maintained. We could not locate a restaurant in the premises. We could also see a number of birds in the surroundings. A good place to visit with the kids for a picnic. Recommended.","October 19, 2022",0.0,0.0

It was joyous. I was able to spend precious time  close to the elephants that I adore.  Fast forward to 2022 when a couple of months ago we took two of our  grandchildren to relive the experience from 20 years ago. Only one word can describe it...horrendous.  Elephant welfare has been overtaken by unscrupulous keepers out to make as much money from visitors as they can. Because I was obviously carrying our money in my bag I was separated from my family by the keepers who aggressively tried to obtain R5000 from me. Every picture that you took they wanted paying for. Needless to say after a lot of shouting by me to my family and eventually joining them,  they reluctantly backed off. We then saw them hounding a young female backpacker for money. After we went to rescue her she told us she feigned not being able to understand them to thankfully not part with any money. By late afternoon the keepers went home and the orphanage was left to the mahoots to feed and care for the elephants. 3 large tuskers were chained up and exhibiting shocking distress the whole time we were there. To be fair and with just us left in the park, watching the elephants being fed was a wonderful experience. It is such a shame that the elephants, who we believe to be living in an orphanage where you expect care and kindness to be uppermost, are living in nothing more than a money making theme park. Research, and find many other orphanages in Sri Lanka, that do exactly what it says on the tin.","July 26, 2022",0.0,0.0

I do agree with lots of the reviews here, its not an elephant orphanage, its a tourist attraction. Its clear the Elephants are trained , some of them are chained to rocks in order to tame them around people, we did see some not so nice treatment of elephants, which at times was uncomfortable. On the flip side to this, as someone who has never been close to Elephants before it was amazing to see so many in the river playing. It was definitely an experience and to be honest I don't regret going but Im not 100% sure if I would go again just because of the animal treatment. Also be aware - this is 100% a money making tourist attraction. We stayed in the hotel right on the water (thats another review in itself..) but when we arrived if we wanted to go to our hotel we had to pay an entry fee to the 'park' then if you want a photo or to touch or feed the elephants, its made out this is fine but you're then demanded to pay the staff , and they want more than you give them. A tough one to review, as a brit it did seem a little odd and hard to tell what treatment the animals get, but it was an experience we wont forget - so I think you have to make your mind up based on the reviews.","July 19, 2022",0.0,0.0

As close to them being in the wild and their natural habitat as you can get.  This experience alone is well worth the visit, the rest of the park is average with elephants grazing in different areas.  One highlight was seeing the twin baby elephants with their mother.  There are a few informational boards scattered around the park but apart from this information was lacking.  Wear a hat and cover yourself in sunblock, take water, as there is nowhere to escape the sun.

What happened next totally destroyed my good feelings about the place... During watching elephants with my friends, we have been asked by one of the employees to come to see the elephants closers from better spot. We have been standing on the platform above one of the elephants. Then the elephant came closers to the platform and raised his trunk to us. The employees around asked us to touch him a suggested that they would take several pictures of us and the elephant. I felt sth is not right so I denied to touch the elephant and take pictures. My friends agreed to take the picture while touching the elephant. Then I spotted that one of the employees below the platform was pointing his sharp hook at the elephant's trunk, so he pushed him this way to keep the trunk up so that visitors could touch the elephant. After seeing this, I left the place immediately.

We were dropped here by our driver (TripAdvisor's day trip to Kandy) but the place was everything else than what we expected and hoped. We were told to go visit the elephant orphanage but what we saw was a shady business that scams unaware tourists. The place was called Maharaja elephant village but there's no information about it in internet but it's located also in Kegalle so I figured it out it's connected with this ""orphanage"". Someone said they rent elephants from there to offer riding for tourist. We wanted just to see the elephants, take some pictures and maybe feed them. We bought the cheapest tickets, which were not cheap at all! In euros around 35€ head! They offered also 1 km and 500 m rides but we were just interested to see them. As soon as we stepped in we saw three elephants in captivity, chains in their feet. Myself and my boyfriend were put to sit on top of one and walked a short loop. During it we felt really bad because the guy walking the elephant was yelling and threatening the elephant with a sharp arm. They would have wanted to take us to the river for the bath but we refused because of feeling that awful for the animal. Other man had my boyfriend's phone all the time and was taking pictures of us. After the riding this man started to insist money for the pictures he had taken. After giving some for him because of the stressful situation he even ask us to give more money to the guy walking the elephant. We said we didn't have more money and they seemed really unhappy because of this. We got to feed the elephant some bananas but then we were quickly pushed to leave the area. All this happened in about 10 minutes. I tried to ask questions about the elephants but the man didn't really say much. We left the place really upset and feeling sorry for the elephants after everything we saw and experienced.

Also, it's nice to see that the their PR Manager makes an effort to reply to most of the reviews on this page.","March 25, 2020",0.0,0.0

Also few installations and information boards are provided to inform all about the history of the place and its evolution through years. It also talks about the mahouts or elephant keepers and tools used by them to control the pachyderms. Duration of visit will be about 1 hour.

The elephants have been 'rescued' and they appear happy enough but I had the vague feeling thye were like peforming elephants in a zoo.  It is a geat expeirence to being down a thoroughfre and suddenly a small herd of elephants (with their handlers) wlk past you.  It was great too to see them behaving quite natrally in the water.  But there were some moments of disquiet.  Some of the elephants are chained, and I accept and understand why, but it does leave an impression.  A couple of the elephants are also forced to lie down in the water for the benefit of the crowd which I was not sure of either.  Still, it was an experience althougha bit expensive, 3000 rupees per foreigner.  If you want the experience of feeding a quiet elephant, you can also do that for 250 rupees.  There are no elephant rides and I was pleased about that.  Finally watch out for a scam with the mahouts (handlers).  They will try to isolate you away from the crowd and lead you up into an area by yourself.  They then offer to photograph you with an elephant by yourself but won't return your camera/iphone until you pay them money.  I was offered this a couple of times but did not do it.  I did see a family forking out a few thousand rupees to one of them so watch out for it.","March 17, 2020",0.0,0.0

This was my first holiday to Sri Lanka even though my parents are Sri Lankan. I had heard many stories from my relatives about the elephants at Pinnawala and had always wanted to visit. In saying that, making the decision to go was a tough one as I am aware that currently Pinnawala is classed as ‘slightly controversial’ & I am an extreme animal lover! Nevertheless after reading many reviews (some from people whom haven’t even visited the site!?), I decided that I needed to see it for myself & make up my own mind. My honest opinion was that I was pleasantly surprised and I believe that they are genuinely trying to improve the operations of the park. Out of the 90 odd elephants I saw there, the majority were free roaming and appeared to enjoy their free time and bathing in the river. The only elephants I saw had chains were some of the males which is more for everyone’s protection so as not to cause a stampede. There were also 2 that were in pens apparently under veterinary care. The only “tourist” interaction that I saw was the fruit feeding which I avidly took part in - i bought like 4 baskets of fruit to give to 2 beautiful elephants. (**And for those people complaining about having to pay for the fruit baskets- get over it! It only costs like $2 aud for a basket of fruit! You pay way more than that for animal encounters in western countries and that’s not included in your ticket price either!) No tourists (that I saw) were allowed to bathe with the elephants etc at the park and I didn’t really see any “exploitation” as such. Ie, I did not see any elephant rides being provided. It was just a joy to see them down at the river with many elephants enjoying the water or their mud bath. At the end of the day people will need to make up their own minds as to what they’re comfortable with. I personally am happy I went there and I don’t believe it is as bad as some people are making it out to be.","February 27, 2020",0.0,0.0

However, this is not a nice gesture (even if the locals are otherwise very nice and helpful), but afterwards the hand is held out again for money. Also the small elephants which are ""rescued"" are not let back into freedom. Once an elephant is in Pinnawala, it never leaves again.

This institution caters not only for the abandoned babies but also for those injured and maimed within the jungle.

You would see them use bullhooks & sticks to hit the elephants. But after not visiting the place for more than a decade, I heard about a management change & changes happening at the place itself, so I wanted to see for myself if it was true. Yes, the costs for tourists is still much more than the locals. This won't be equal. South Asian countries pay lesser than the others. For the same price, all the tourists also get entrance to the Pinnawala zoo, which is about a 5min drive away. There are lots of more sheds/shelters built for the elephants to sleep in. They have much more roaming space inside the premises. There are boards & routes marked all over the premises. There are small shops for snacks/drinks as well as souvenirs. There are informational/educational boards. The employees can be easily recognised with their uniforms. You can watch the veterinarions treat some of the elephants. All of these things are new. Since 2012 I've been here 4 times & each time I've seen new, positive changes. Yes, I still sometimes see bulls chained. But they are for multiple different reasons. Some because they are in heat during mating period. Some because they are sick or injured. Some because of their temperament. Yes, I still see some mahouts offering to take pictures with the elephants for tips or using bullhooks/canes to discipline the elephants, but we as visitors should avoid taking pictures with the elephants & complain to the authorities if we see them mistreating the animals.

I think if you can get here with a local guide you would be better off as you can spend as much or as little time as you like at the orphanage, whereas on a ship's tour the time is shorter. This orphanage is a government run orphanage and at least paying guests are aware of this when they enter and hopefully all money raised goes towards the elephant's upkeep and setting them free back into the jungle. I found all the public areas where we went and the enclosures we saw were very clean and tidy. Take Sri Lankan money with you - although you can use CC at the Orphanage shop and other shops in the town, generally speaking they don't take cash unless it's Sri Lankan money. There is an opportunity to feed the elephants by hand in one areas of the orphanage however Rupees are required - no USD or other currency and definitely no CC there !!  Luckily our guide exchanged some USD for Rupees but the fruit was gone very quickly. Yes there were a few elephants chained up in another enclosure but of the three enclosures we saw, this was the only one where they were chained.  The reason we were given for this was because they are wild animals... let's face it ... if they are males and are maturing, they could get annoyed about something and cause injuries to other elephants if not their handlers and / or the public if they crashed through the fence. Indeed at the elephant feeding area I saw one elephant get grumpy with another one for muscling in on the food I was feeding it - the elephant turned around and head butted the second elephant in its side to show it's displeasure at eating its food. The third area where we saw elephants at this Orphanage, the elephants were roaming free in a large treed area ... I wondered if this was the first stage of getting them used to fending for themselves before setting them free in the jungle. We had lunch included in our ship's shore excursion at a hotel by the river and luckily for us, they had quite a few elephants bathing there - a lovely thing to see. IMO, this excursion is not suitable for mobility impaired people because the terrain to get to the elephant enclosures is not paved and the surface is uneven.  There's also a few steps to negotiate within the elephant orphanage area.  Also, the ""road"" to the hotel where we went for lunch was not paved either.","December 16, 2019",0.0,0.0

It seems this place is more for making money than helping animals. Most of the animals were chained up not able to roam free. There was also an area for I guess the elephants that could not be with the rest of the population and they were chained in an area that was dark and smellyand they were weaving back and forth. This is a sign of distress which many of the elephants exhibited. Once it was time for the elephants to bathe in the water they walked them down in chains while the handlers prodded them with their bull hooks. I was shocked to see how aggressive they were with the elephants. If the wanted the elephant to move or stand a certain way they would hit it with a wooden stick then take the hook part and stab the head of the elephants. You could see when the handlers came around the elephants were scared. I also saw them prodding elephants to pick things up and move them. They were using them for work abs using the hooks to get them to do what they wanted. It was an extremely sad and disturbing place.

But as it turned out, I was part of a group and because the group wanted to go, I had little option but to tag along. What I saw there truly horrified me. 1. Elephant calves were confined in a circular pen and their legs tied with metal chains that left little room for manoeuvre or free movement. 2. There was a tusker displaying a classic case of depressive symptoms - head swaying incessantly and bobbing up and down. Like the calves, he was also tied with a short metal chain in a small shed. 3. A herd of elephants we saw there was so scared of the keeper that as soon as he entered the enclosure with his bull-hook, the terrified elephants literally fled away from him. The keeper was careful not to display any aggressive behaviour in front of the tourists but it was obvious from how scared the elephants were, that terrible things go on behind the scenes. 4. While there, we saw a keeper repeatedly strike a pregnant elephant with a huge pole that had a metal spike at its end. He poked and struck her hard despite the presence of tourists there. I cannot imagine what must be going on once tourist hours are over. We then headed off to the river adjacent to the orphanage where they take the elephants for a bath - hoping that at least there, the elephants must be free. But they were not. Even here, the elephants were tied with short chains while tourists threw fruit at them. I would've compared Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage to a zoo but most zoos treat their animals better than this 'orphanage' does. Pinnawala is not a place I would ever visit again. My money isn't going into a place that has made a business out of abusing animals that should've been returned to the wild. Plus, they breed elephants in confinement at Pinnawala. Real orphanages don't typically do that. Instead, I would strongly recommend visiting the Elephant Transit Home near Udawalawe National Park. I haven't been there but from what I've heard, they are much more responsible in caring for orphaned elephants. Plus they return the elephants to the wild once they are old enough - unlike Pinnawala.","November 19, 2019",0.0,0.0

From the looks of things, these elephants were chained for tourists photos as they were dotted around the hotel points and only need the front (of the viewing platform). The elephants are also clearly scared of the mahouts & when one of them began to ride the elephant he was nearly kicked off. We went up to the ‘relaxing zone’ which didn’t look that way for the elephants at all. It sort of looks like an elephant zoo enclosure, however yet again all elephants there were chained up and visibly distressed.

They advertise saying elephants are “semi wild” but reality is, elephants are not well treated, elephants have mahouts to be trained and unfortunately they don’t have a proper semiwild life. Elephants will end working for temples and going to Parahera in some point which makes me really sad. Pinnawala orphanage says there are 84 elephants but visible you can only see a group of 27 elephants + other group of 10 sick elephants. Where are the others? I would say, chained, because they refuse to be domesticated* I paid 3k rupees for the entrance expecting to see elephants having a better care. I am the person who would pay more if elephants are well treated. Elephants only eat once per day (kindly note elephants of Pinnawala are well fitted), but still, the nature of elephants is to eat several times per day. Sri Lanka government, please do something to improve the programs for elephants, I understand your mindset, culture and religion and most important I respect it, I understand the value and meaning of Parahera, but don’t advertise lies. Please give a better care for them. Elephants are humble and loyal animals we should be better for them. *Note: some elephants are on their Musth period, is understandable that they remain separated from the group, but, are 50 elephants on their Musth? Don’t think so. Note 2: tourism is an income that Pinnawala orphanage needs to give elephants a better life.

We visited early in the morning and saw the elephants bathing and then went back to the reserve and saw some elephant there in the enclosures. Did we see cruelty? No. Did we see chains? Yes. Was I impressed? I don't think so. Now, I have to confess to not being a fan of zoos on the whole but I can really appreciate a zoo that has a conservation ethos (Twycross for instance) Pinnawala felt like a poor zoo to me. A few elephants paraded for public entertainment. Thats ok I guess if there is a greater good but I'm not sure there is.

The bull elephants were chained on the way to the river for safety, these male elephants are enormous about 8feet high and its a way of controlling them whilst going down to the river, we looked at there feet there was no sores cuts or callous the male and females are separated when they go down the river because the males can get very aggressive at no point did we see any keepers use sticks on the elephants, we had a lovely time and glad we went, at least being at this place they are not poached and left to die.","May 1, 2019",0.0,0.0

Happily, I found nothing worthy of a complaint. The elephants parade down to the river and anyone who knows animals can see that they are intelligent beings who are used to the routine and are not at all stressed by the watching crowds - in fact, some clearly loved it and were happy to participate and be patted or fed a morsel along the way.  Once in the river they splash, roll around in the water and clearly enjoy themselves. Yes, some did have a loose chain around their necks, but this didn't bother them. When you consider the size of an elephant and the general havoc they could cause to a community when aggressive, it's not difficult to understand that there are times when they must be prudently restrained or separated. As for returning them all to the wild; these elephants no longer have a place in the wild as they have formed new family bonds within their new herd. Many have already been rescued from the wild where they were close to death and others are on medication or special food. So if you want to truly help elephants and not just have a pompous rant about turning them loose, visit Pinnawala, spend a few dollars towards their support and watch them happily splash about in safety.","April 27, 2019",0.0,0.0

The stamp of the country’s Department of Wildlife Conservation on the park was the deciding factor. Over a twenty year period, Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage hand raised abandoned babies, treated the injured and integrated displaced elephants into a growing herd. Currently, 88 elephants are part of the Pinnawala family on their 30-acre property, making it one of Sri Lanka’s largest tourist attractions. At Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage you will see chains. This is precautionary for large males while bathing, wandering the park – river path, and when a female’s seductive pheromones spike. A full grown male can stand more than 2.5 metres weighing  5.5 tonnes. A force to be reckoned with when they want to get down to business. You will also see mahouts rounding the elephants to keep them in one spot. This is also precautionary to keep them from getting too close to punters. A disappointing observation was people paying some entrepreneurial mahouts to bathe the elephants. The elephant is chained and made to lie on its side during the encounter. This is not approved and is something the orphanage is trying to eliminate. Elephants eat an average of 250kg of food per day, multiply that by 88 of them and you have an expensive grocery bill. Modern veterinary equipment and traditional indigenous medicine come at a price and the gallons of milk required to raise a baby elephant is also exorbitant. Sponsorship programs, donations and your ticket price all contribute to the cost of feeding and caring for these adorable creatures. Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage is not perfect, but the care for these elephants is obvious. This is a heavily tourist-trafficked attraction. Vendors take advantage of the captive audience and sell everything from elephant poo paper products (quite an interesting process) to every form of elephant printed clothing you can imagine. Away from this retail madness, however, is picturesque countryside, a meandering river and comfortable accommodation.","April 10, 2019",0.0,0.0

The Rep advised the chains were required as the Bulls do get aggressive.  What I don’t understand is elephants should be able to roam freely, however when we visited I was sad to see these poor animals in such distress. When you approach the orphanage you are advised not to purchase any fruit but to buy inside, the place was heaving with local school children coach loads - not sure if this is part of their school curriculum but vast amount visiting.  The elephants in the watering hole seemed dazed and when one elephant approach the handler who has a stick with a hook to control the elephants came close she quickly reacted and walked away - the elephants seemed lifeless and bored.  One elephant was showing signs of distress side to side shaking her head and body - not nice to see.  We then visited the feeding stations and walked passed where the elephants are seen my the public - makes you wonder how much space do these elephants have to roam - not a great deal.  I saw the bull elephants chained and what was so shocking was the behaviour again rocking back and forth - this is where he remains all day - and the phrase for the wealth and safety of all elephants was the reason - this was utterly sad, such a beautiful animal chained. Again aware the cultural differences but, somehow human instinct should kick in for anyone to see these elephants are anything but happy. We then visited the feeding station once again for the elephants to perform - one of the man handlers asked if I wanted a picture of the elephant raising its trunk - he called the elephant over and used this stick to control her - just like a circus act, and she had chains around her neck. Please think twice about contributing to this orphanage in hindsight I regret contributing, and my advice would be be go on the safari - this is where you see elephants roaming freely and happy but the choice is yours.","March 20, 2019",0.0,0.0

This is basically a zoo (even worse than a zoo) than an orphanage. How often do you see children in orphanage tied up with chains and made to walk a long alleyway just so that a few tourists who paid exorbitant prices for tickets can watch them walk and feed them coconuts? The elephants take bath in the pond which is at the opposite side of the road from the orphanage, twice a day. We were very excited that we reached just in time when the elephants were getting ready to walk through that alley to go to the pond to take bath. What we saw was very disappointing. Almost all the elephants were chained to their teeth. Most of them were missing their tusks (don't know when it happened) and almost all of them just sat in the pond and did nothing. Inside the orphanage, it was the same story. You can see them grazing or can give them bananas or other fruits (there are extra charges for that as you can only buy the fruits from one of the shops inside the orphanage). We were from the SAARC country so we paid 750 LKR per person for entry but I think for foreign tourists from other countries the fees is around 3000 LKR. It is highly overpriced and it's better to actually go to Marissa and watch whales in their natural habitat instead of seeing chained Elephants sitting in water.

We were hoping it would be the highlight of our trip, sadly it left us with bad memories for this part of the trip. We started watching the elephants in the water from an adjacent hotel veranda, the elephants certainly didn't appear to want to be there, they were corralled to stay close to the hotels so that visitors could see them.  We then went to the land site on the opposite side of the road, again elephants are corralled for the entertainment of the viewing public. A very heavily pregnant elephant was trying to get to a water hole at the top of the paddock with some other elephants following, however the mahouts would not let her rest and drove her and her followers to the part of the paddock closest to the tourists.  In another part of the paddock one of the mahouts was repeatedly hitting an elephant in the leg making it squeal, a sound I don't want to hear again.  One of the staff stood near me kept saying 'happy elephant'. I'm not David Attenborough but I would say that the elephant was not squealing with delight.  There were also other elephants under shelter which clearly had mental issues and were heavily chained, I do however appreciate that where they have been rescued from may be the cause of their problems and not the place they have come to. I have read through some of the reviews and they do vary widely and of course they're all personal assessments, some cultures approach animal care differently, for instance some have referred to being able to ride the elephants which I personally don't agree with.  I would strongly recommend you think seriously about visiting this place, yes there are a lot of elephants here which is great, but the evident lack of care for them is distressing if you are an animal lover.","March 12, 2019",0.0,0.0

It was lovely to see the elephants walking to the river for  a bathe. We got quite close to a few of the cheeky ones who came up to the chain where we could stand. Yes a few of the males have a chain to a leg but we were told they were the ""frisky"" ones and it was to help keep them under control. The older  males are separated from the females as in the wild . They even have a ""murderer"" male which is kept apart from all the others and needs a few members of staff around when cleaning his area. He apparently has killed humans when he was in the wildlife reserves-  so nice to see he has been given a chance to life as his rages were probably instigated by humans  who didn't behave appropriately around him. We were told not to buy fruit from the street sellers and were always reminded to behave appropriately. Such a joy to see these huge creatures.","March 1, 2019",0.0,0.0

Some are in chains but these are male elephants and are to control their natural aggression to other males. The mahmood’s use sticks to encourage understanding of commands - again for the safety of the elephants and surrounding people. They use the sticks to apply pressure to vital points ( acupuncture points) which do not harm the elephants - if you’ve ever been struck in a pressure point you will know a slight jab doesn’t hurt but does encourage the body to move in a certain way. This is what they do with the Sticks. You couldn’t move an elephant with a shove or a little stick otherwise. If you’re concerned with the treatment suggest research first before judging. Many of the elephants come from farmland where they’ve been trapped in holes dug by farmers to collect water. They often have broken limbs when they come to the sanctuary. Once recovered, most are returned to the forests. Some pictures attached of the time we watched them bathing. One thing to note - from wherever you are you will likely take some time to get there.

We did not wait to see all the elephants make their way back past the shops and street stalls but that might have been fun. Back at the orphanage the pens, albeit large, just did not offer any stimulation for the elephants. Even though they are trying to make improvements the orphanage itself was not what we expected or would like to consider as acceptable for keeping what are wild elephants.

The tourists arrive in a campus that is completely human-created as opposed to what the pictures seem to show, surrounded by elephant cages and yards where the elephants are being held captive with chains in place and keepers armed with spears. The elephants are paraded every few hours to the ''feeding area'' and the ''bathing river''. Both these areas are places to which the elephants are forced to walk to, clearly displaying signs of stress and resistance to the keepers. The smaller elephants that they call ''babies'' are used for public demonstrations of milk nursing. A local guide explained to us that these babies are in fact adult elephants with over 8 years that are kept in confined places and fed milk so they remain small and cute for the tourists to believe in the whole ''orphanage'' thing. I believe this orphanage started as a place for rescued elephants, but nowadays it's clearly only a zoo for captive mistreated elephants that should be in programs to be returned to the wild. Many guides admit to take tourists here only because of its international popularity, against their own beliefs. IN SUM, if you have the time, for the SAME PRICE of visiting this scam, you can go on a full day safari at the beautiful national parks of Sri Lanka and see wild elephants happy in their proper habitats. Please spread the word and complain to your travel agency as most of the european or any international proposed itineraries in Sri Lanka propose Pinnawala as a must, and this has to absolutely change, together with the overpriced fake spice garden tours.","January 21, 2019",0.0,0.0

The orphanage would love to see all elephants in the wild, unfortunately this is impossible with pressures on land use by a growing population.  They cant introduce elephants to an existing wild herd as they would not be accepted.  All elephants in the orphanage have been raised in captivity so would seek out people if released and this would in turn create conflict risking the elephants life. The mahouts do shout and use ashoks with elephants to ensure public safety.  To see behind the public face and watch them tenderly go over the elephants skin for 2 hours looking for problems shows their true feelings towards the animals.  They shout at the cleaners if the elephant houses are not sufficiently cleaned. The prices are fair for tourists and cheaper for locals to encourage locals to visit, learn and take an interest in their own wildlife.  This is a government run organisation so the prices are set in Colombo, not by the orphanage.  The extra fee for feeding or bathing elephants is likewise set by the politicians. The Elephant in the Room - chains.  These are necessary to manage the herd in a small area to keep public, staff and elephants safe.  Injured, sick and pregnant elephants are kept separate, but still taken for free time at the river away from the main herd. There are 19 elephants housed here which have been seized from illegal owners and are awaiting court cases so can't be put with the herd. In all we really enjoyed our 2 weeks here giving us an insight not gained during a short visit.  Volunteering is hard work and not for everybody.  We learnt about the politics behind a lot of decisions and saw the love held for these wonderful creatures by all the staff at the orphanage.","January 20, 2019",0.0,0.0

Yes, there are chains used to anchor, help control and keep the elephants safe as well as the many visitors this place has. In addition, the males - especially when in musth - need to be controlled and seperated. These elephants can never be released in to the wild, so ensuring they can not wander off when in the river is essential. I did not see any evidence of distress, and I saw some lovely interactions in the main herd with some of the younger ones playing. They genuinely seemed to enjoy their time in the river, and seeing them walk through the main street was an experience!

I was genuinely expecting to have a good time but instead got an instant bad feeling as soon as I stepped inside. We first saw the elephants (around 10 of the 60 elephants in total at the orphanage) being walked from one enclosure to another and noticed that the majority of the elephants had chains wrapped around their front legs and necks, with two or three also having chains around their back legs too, greatly restricting their movement. When being walked to the enclosure they were being herded by a group of “zoo keepers”, all armed and taunting the elephants with hook spears. The elephants were all very obviously terrified of these zoo keepers. After spending some time infront of the crowds in the enclosure (still chained up), the elephants were herded down to the nearby river. I thought that this could have been a positive side to the day, as maybe the elephants could have had some time playing in the water with a bit more freedom. However, this turned out to be untrue as I noticed that some of the elephants were chained down to the rockbed of the river and the rest stood with no movement as they were hosed down by one of the staff members, the whole time still being surrounded and intimidated by the spear welding zoo keepers. We decided to leave as the elephants were being walked back up to the to the enclosures, all of zookeepers guiding them by their chains (and even one holding on to one of the elephant’s tails). I didn’t plan on leaving this review today and am not trying to exaggerate to push any sort of personal agenda, I am just writing exactly what I saw. It was very obvious that nobody at this “orphanage” cared about these elephants and everyone, from the zookeepers to the surrounding marketstall owners selling merchandise, saw these animals as ways to make money off the masses of tourists. I regret visiting and contributing money to this organisation and this whole experience left me very deeply and genuinely upset.","December 29, 2018",0.0,0.0

More of a commercial establishment to sell substances, gift items with elephant name or photo somewhere.

All the male elephants were chained around their ankles. There were several men with pointy sticks that were keeping them in the river. This is a zoo not an orphanage. It costs 2500 LKN per person for foreigners to enter which is extremely expensive. There are also several money making opportunities for the Zoo once you enter. For example you can feed the elephants for 250 LKN, give baby elephants milk for 350 LKN, wash an elephant in the river for 750 LKN or ride the elephants.

I've been twice - earlier this month and 21 years ago - and I've enjoyed the experience both times. The price of 2500 rupees (about £11 per person) is quite high but much lower than I've seen online where it's often stated at $20 per person. There's not too much to do. Our driver went in with us which we thought a bit odd until we realised he knew exactly where to go and when to make sure we got the best experience. We went first to the elephant 'paddocks' where the ladies were hanging around eating and waiting for bath time. In a separate area, the boys were getting ready to go the river. Nothing can really prepare you for seeing a massive herd of elephants on the move. The boys went first, strolling through the orphanage, out to the road and down to the river. Some are chained - for their safety and everybody else's. I don't think it's a bad thing. Once the boys were on their way, the lady elephants followed. We watched the bath time for nearly 2 hours. Our driver urged us to a brilliant watching space in a cafe which we really appreciated. In two hours you have plenty of time to watch and observe the different personalities amongst the elephants. There are the cheeky younger boys, the stubborn old ladies, the frisky and the laid-back all hanging out together. People have commented on the use of 'spikes' or 'guides'. We was the metal guides being used by the mahoots but always very gently and never with any violence. The love of the handlers for their pachyderm pals was clear to all. One old lady - quite possibly the grande dame of the herd - spent an hour standing knee deep trying to avoid a wash. Her mahoot gently urged her into deeper water, taking his time and using his 'guide' to help scrape old mud off her head and back. Eventually she gave in and rolled over in the water to let him clean her properly. Some are chained in the water but didn't seem distressed about it. A couple of young females made a jovial bid for freedom on the far banks and were laughingly chased down and returned to the herd. If you're looking for lots of action, this may disappoint. If you have the patience to watch and wait, you'll probably love it as much as I did. One comment. I think the management should consider rebranding this as an Elephant Home rather than an Elephant Orphanage since it seems to create elevated expectations of lots of babies and at present there really aren't many at all. The purpose of the home is to give safe haven to elephants, not to go looking for unwanted babies. Back in the days of the Civil War, a lot of babies were orphaned by their parents being killed (accidentally or intentionally) so there were more little ones to see. These days they do have a few babies but I suspect that's more an outcome of boy and girl elephants getting friendly rather than any kind of captive breeding programme.","November 22, 2018",0.0,0.0

Visited with family & my 4 year Son enjoyed the elephants bathing in the river. It's fun to watch the elephant parade when all the roads are cleared of public - so the elephants can go back to the orphanage after bathing in the river. There is a restaurant overlooking the river & the entire lane has a lot of road shopping stuff in terms of clothes, souvenirs, etc. They have time slots reserved for the elephants to bathe, be fed, etc. One can pay & feed the elephants.","November 15, 2018",0.0,0.0

They blow a siren warns of approaching elephants to signal that the elephants are on the way, you can stand within 2 feet or so of the procession. Once safe, make your way back to the rocks by the water. This is an excellent vantage point to enjoy the spectacle. when all merchants guided all tourists inside and took their merchandise inside as well. Then dozens of elephants marched through the 200m market street and some bags and t-shirts feel down to the ground as they had passed by so close to the shops including the poo shop. The keepers or mahouts also carry ""guide sticks"" to help direct the elephants to the bathing river etc. They never hit or hurt the elephants with these sticks, they just use them gently to guide them safely across the roads etc.  Then we positioned ourselves on the verandah of the Hotel, where to also had lunch overlooking the river & got a really good view of the Elephants being washed & playing in the water.","November 12, 2018",0.0,0.0
