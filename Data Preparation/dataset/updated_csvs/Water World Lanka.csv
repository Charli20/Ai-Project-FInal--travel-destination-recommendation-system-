This place is filled with a variety of local and exotic birds and fish. This place, which attracts special attention from young children, is also suitable for adults. The park is divided into four sections: Sea World, Bird Park, Underwater Tunnel, and River  Safari . There is a restaurant where you can buy food and drinks and you can get lunch from there. The weak point I saw here is that the amount of underwater space is very small and the path for electricity to travel through it is not working properly. The highlight of the here is the small boat ride that is offered to us. If you're looking for a place to go to entertain your child during the holidays, this is a great place to do it.","November 14, 2025",0.0,0.0

This lacks cleanliness and to see that the property is not maintained properly. People have literd the place and the gardens could be landscaped and planted with tropical plants that grow without much caring, seating could be arranged nicely, more bins to be kept in the gardens. The seats were all dirty never washed even the place doesn't seem to be swept and well kept. Actually to bring this type of places to a foreign standard only a little is necessary to be done. The upkeep must be high then the ticket price should be raised at least to 1500 for adults and 750 for a child. Sri Lanka has to think ahead not to be where we are today. Just a matter of improvement which could make this place into a wonder.","August 23, 2025",0.0,0.0

They had various kinds of fish and animals in this park. You can see a lot of birds in the birds park. Usually a busy place and not much parking space in this area. They have an under water tunnel, but actually a much shorter one than I thought. It's not a fair experience. But they have a river safari that went through different kinds of animals and it was like an adventure tour. You can contribute to feed the birds and it would be a lovely experience. Fair ticket rates and you can earn a nice experience. Toilets available. Good for kids.","January 27, 2025",0.0,0.0

Cutting to the chase; The visit was an exciting experience for the kids, while for the adults the diversity of aquatic life was sufficient to hold our interest. There is also a bird park which is smaller in comparison but is still worth a mention. The fish and the birds are kept in very small, cramped enclosures which is reminiscent of the Dehiwala zoo and I felt uneasy at times as we progressed through the exhibits (which in a few instances were in a dilapidated condition). I would sincerely request the management to look at a facelift for the park while also looking at reducing the specimens carried in each enclosure as it was sad to see so many animals cramped into very small spaces. This is not bad place for a field trip, or a one time visit. There are very interesting sites which must be seen. That being said I am unlikely to visit again.","November 5, 2017",0.0,0.0

It was moderately crowded. They have a small car park but this may not be sufficient for long. There were no queues and it was easy to get in. Ticket is a little pricier than accustomed to, but nothing too expensive. The place is fairly well laid out, ensuring you do not miss anything. There are signs, and descriptions next to the exhibits, however the descriptions are not consistent in that some exhibits do not have descriptions, while others have extremely interesting to read and detailed ones, with highlights of the species, and indicates if it is something exhibited for the first time in Sri Lanka, hybrid species, etc... There is a very large variety of fish and birds on display here, and some very stunning exhibits. They also have a small (10meter) underwater tunnel with a moving walkway, which is a first for Sri Lanka and despite the small size, they should be given a special mention for building and operating it. While a decent effort, the entire place gives off that ""almost there at International levels but not quite"" vibe. With a little finishing work done, such as better descriptions on the animals, it could be a star attraction. The biggest disappointment has to be the shark tank; all the sharks were very small ones (maybe less than 3 feet length). The best part has to be the birds on exhibit; there is a wide variety of colourful birds that will delight all ages. It should also be noted that this place does not appear to be disabled friendly: floor levels are uneven, there are stairs to be navigated, and in the fish tanks area there is very almost no lighting at floor level.

[1] Form the eye of a local who, have not experienced a popular aquarium in a foreign country. [2] From the eye of a person who has been to at least one of the popular foreign aquariums , but still want to spend some time in a local aquarium with friends, kids and family. [3] from the eye of a person who is looking for a world class aquarium to visit. I recommend this place to the first two group of people. When compared to the other aquariums in Sri Lanaka, I believe this place is well maintained.(More to improve of course). The displays are well maintained, informative and spacious. The tour is worth for the amount we pay. I went with few friends and few kids aging around 5 years. They had a nice time there. The under water tunnel they market these days (2013) is well set up and I believe this is a good achievement in the Sri Lnakan  context. The tunnel is 30 feet long and the setup has well established with standards. There is a large play area with loads of play equipment. Overall, this is a great experience for the locals who do not have  the luxury of traveling abroad. There are many points to improve: As tharinduc mentioned [1] First place limited Car parking. management should look in to this seriously. There are few adjoining land plots converted in to car parks by neighbors and started a business there. But I recommend this should be organised, otherwise this will become a mafia. [2] Overall the pace get hot when its around noon, mainly because the concrete structures. Air conditioning will not be a feasible option. But spraying cool water in places can be done. [3] The Bird cages are double meshed , making it hard to see the birds. Sometimes its necessary to protect birds from crazy visitors. But this needs to be addressed without comprising the main course of displaying the birds. [4] The only canteen is not sufficient when the place is crowded. The management should set up a good canteen and a souvenir shop. Overall, This is a good place for a local who want to witness a good aquarium or want to spend few hours with your loved ones showing them some beautiful fish and birds. If you are a traveler who already have experienced aquariums abroad or want to experience a world class aquarium, this may not be the place for you. Hope the management improve the place to give a convenient  experience to visitors.","March 11, 2013",0.0,0.0

But we were really disappointed after going to the place. Quality of the place is no way near to the quality you get in other countries. Price is reasonable, 280Rs for a local adult for both water world and bird park and it is 400Rs for a foreign adult. First of all, no proper car parking. There is a small car park which is full. Then we had to wait in queue for 30 minutes as it's a holiday. The queue is poorly managed and people have to stand in sun for long to get a ticket. At least a shade should be built. We got tickets to both the bird park and water world. Bird park has a larger and expensive collection of birds when compared to Dehiwala zoo. But the bird cages are poorly built with 2 layers where it is quite hard to see the bird inside. Many birds caged alone in small cages making us sad about the creature inside. Water world has a large collection of fish. Again it's quite hot inside the tunnels making us very uncomfortable. There was a tiny piece of tunnel called under water tunnel, but it's nothing much to see really as it's a poorly built mini tunnel about 15 feet in length. You can only see few small fish there and the tunnel is built on the soil and not under water. Also there was only 1 small cafeteria inside with nothing much to eat or drink. Overall, if you are a tourist, avoid this place at all costs. If you are a local and have not traveled abroad, this maybe something to amuse you.
