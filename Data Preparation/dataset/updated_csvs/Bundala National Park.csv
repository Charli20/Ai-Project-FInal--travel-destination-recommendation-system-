We’re so glad that we did because this national park is superb. Whilst is doesn’t have all of the ‘big game’ animals that you might see elsewhere, it has plenty to offer especially when it comes to bird life. There is plenty of other wildlife to spot there too. What made it special for us was, firstly, how quiet the place was (we only saw 2 other safari vehicles during our trip) and, secondly, how brilliant the rangers were. They were by far the most knowledgeable of the rangers we met at 3 different parks, and excellent at spotting animals too. We also stopped at a lovely secluded cove overlooking the sea, and we had the place to ourselves! Bundala was a different experience compared with the other parks that we visited in Sri Lanka: quieter and more laid-back, but still offering plenty to see. Definitely worth a visit!","October 13, 2025",0.0,0.0

Here you can enjoy vd environment. The driver took all the time and let us watch as long as we wanted, not bothered by other visitors. Lots of crocodiles and elephants to see, next to all the birds. At least this park still looks like a piece of untouched nature.  Already done some safaris with the big5, but still enjoyed this park very much.","September 1, 2025",0.0,0.0

Also elephants, peacocks, deer, water buffalos, crocodiles and many more. Relatively less crowded than Yala. Lovely huge cliffs overlooking the crashing waves of the ocean at the edge of the park. Overall, a wonderful experience with many animal and bird sightings in a serene, quiet and very green environment.","April 17, 2025",0.0,0.0

On our safari we saw several species including flamingoes, peacocks, cormorants, painted storks, ducks and many more indistinguishable waterfowl. Other fauna seen included Asian elephants, spotted deer, partially submerged crocodiles, macaques and what our guide said were Muntjac (deer) and sloth bears. We also saw mating mongooses and large rabbits. Besides that, the flora includes over 300 different plant species, some only found here. It is best to come early morning or late afternoon to see more species. The terrain is a little rough during rainy periods so take that into consideration. A wonderful experience.","February 7, 2025",0.0,0.0
