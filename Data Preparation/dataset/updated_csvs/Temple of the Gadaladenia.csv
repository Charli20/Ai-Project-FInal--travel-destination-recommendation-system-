In the hall of the shrine there is an original statue of a Buddha sitting in meditation. At the entrance, however, there are also Hindu deities. There is then a secondary shrine consisting of a covered stupa with a roof and four other small stupas on the sides, where 4 Buddha statues are housed. We found it full of schoolchildren and were greeted by the caretaker-artist, Mr Rathnajake. He will tell you the story of the temple and much more with the love he employs in his designs.
