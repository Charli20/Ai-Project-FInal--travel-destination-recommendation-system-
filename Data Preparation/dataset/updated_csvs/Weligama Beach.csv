Reduce single use plastics, recycle, support local legislation to decrease production of plastics, encourage use of reusable compostable non plastic bottles and bags, provide bins to dispose of trash properly, government dispose of trash in environmentally safe ways, spread the news, educate, volunteer and support charities who are trying to make change.

There's plenty of space on the beach itself, and in the water. There are no rocks or reefs either so its relatively safe for surfing. The only problem is the litter and local water pollution. After a day of swimming my shorts are brown from all the dirt in the water. If you go swimming, you'll feel plastic moving around near your feet (especially after heavy rains). There is next to no underwater visibility. So for swimming or snorkelling, you just need to get a Tuk Tuk to one of the many other nice beaches in the area.

There's about 50 surf schools all. Down the beach where you can rent boards and get lessons. You can surf from 5.30amto 6.30 pm in small gentle waves. The afternoon is choppy. The line up is extremely busy all the time so that kind of sucks a lot. There are loads of European idiots who for some reason want to swim in front of begginer surfers who can't turn as they are learners.... The fisherman are polite enough and there is loads of mangy dogs which sometimes run at you but are usually friendly enough. The worst thing that happened was when I went for a quick swim in between lessons a local man came and very obviously masturbated in front of me. The tuk tuks here are extremely annoying and forward and there are too many of them for the amount of travellers. I recommend for beginners for 4-7 days get some lessons but you get sick of the place after that. Or for advanced surfers who want to challenge themselves by dodging between 50 learners. The shops and restaurants on the main road are way more expensive too. If you are confident walk in a few streets and get a local meal. It's quite a tourist trap.

Right in front of the hotel there a guys renting surf and boday boards. Veranga has two jet skis and is super friendly and takes you on rides for a fee and if your confident enough will allow you to take it out yourself. Note worthy is Veranga and his friends on the beach clean the beach spotless of all the garbage and plastic that floats in. They are supported by the hotel who helps to discharge the collected debris. What’s amazing is that they are not paid for this service but genuinely do it out of pure love for the beach. One can contact Veranga on (077) 173 2614 if required.,"November 15, 2018",0.0,0.0

It's a safe beach, where the waves are perfect PERFECT for surfers of all levels. There are shacks aplenty where the ""Surfing Boys"" base themselves and they are looking for your business. Note:  If you a beginner surfer and want a board only, choose one with one fin, not three.  You are likely to loose one in the surf and they will charge you for it.  They know this, you probably should in advance.  To avoid ""hidden"" extra costs go with a surfing lesson. The sand is white and in places clean.  In others it is scattered with dead fish. There are a few restaurants overlooking the beach and sea, but not many. The water is so very warm. At night time towards the end of the beach where the Marriott Hotel is massive night lights come on, pointing out to sea allowing for night surfing. A thought has to go out to the devastating tsunami wave which once took out this beach and everything close by. It's a HUGE beach and maybe that's why it doesn't rate for non-surfer me as a beach to sit or swim at for any great length of time.  For me it just didn't have that more intimate, idyllic feel to it.  Thankfully there are lots of beaches like this in close vicinity so you can pick and choose depending on how you feel if you base yourself at Weligama.","August 2, 2018",0.0,0.0
