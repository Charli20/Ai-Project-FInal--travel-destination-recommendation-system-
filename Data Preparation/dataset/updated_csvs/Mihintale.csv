The moment you arrive, you’re greeted by serene surroundings and a sense of history that feels almost tangible. Climbing the steps to the summit was a little challenging, but every step was worth it for the breathtaking views of the surrounding Anuradhapura plains. The ancient Buddhist ruins, including the monasteries, stupas, and the sacred Bodhi tree, reflect the deep spiritual significance of this place. The Mihintale rock carvings and the bell tower are particularly impressive, offering a glimpse into the craftsmanship of ancient Sri Lanka. What I loved most was the peaceful ambiance; it’s easy to feel a sense of calm and reflection here. Make sure to bring water, wear comfortable shoes, and allocate a few hours to fully explore the site. The sunrise from the top is absolutely magical and worth waking up early for! Highly recommend this spot for history enthusiasts, pilgrims, or anyone looking to experience Sri Lanka’s cultural heritage. Mihintale is a true gem that combines spirituality, history, and natural beauty.","October 14, 2025",0.0,0.0

Try to get there early before the tout groups arrive and the rocks get too hot. You need to take your shoes off before you get to the terrace and the steps are not very smooth. Once on the terrace you can climb a fairly steep rock to a peak with excellent views. The climb is not too strenuous but does require cooperation between ascenders and descenders. It is quite slippery coming down, There is a higher terrace with a couple of huge stupas and also a third climb to the large Buddha statue. Lots of interesting things in addition to these. Be wary of getting food out of your bag - the monkeys will be on you immediately. All in all, well worth a visit.","October 12, 2025",0.0,0.0

""Mihintale"" is one of the sites we visited. Mihinthale is a mountain in Sri Lanka near Anuradhapura. Its a pilgrimage site for the Buddhists in Sri Lanka, and worshippers around the world. Let me give a brief description of ""Mihintale"". It has some some religious monuments, and some ruins. Buddhists visit ""Mihintale"" during the weekends, during special hoildays, or on full moon poya days. This place is always with visitors, local and foreign. Specially in June, on the full moon poya day we could see many pilgrims visit ""Mihintale"" to make their pilgrimage, and then proceed towards Anuradhapura. It has a story of Thera Mahinda who came to Sri Lanka and met King Devanampiyatissa, and preached the Buddhist doctrine, as per books written by authors. There are many books written by authors about the historical places in Sri Lanka, including Mihintale, Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, and other places etc. In Mihintale we could see a small Dagaba, with some stone pillars, a large Stupa known as the ""Maha Seya"" and a Buddha Statue on the summit of the Mihintale hill. It takes about 15 to 20 minutes to climb the mountain peak. The best time to climb is early morning, so that you could see the sunrise. or in the late afternoon when the sun is not that hot, and see the sunset. These are the best times to climb, as you may get dehydrated. You are advised to take a bottle of water to refresh yourself. Wear proper clothing, as no body parts be exposed. Photography is allowed, but if you are to photographing for a reason, you will need to take permission from the authorities at the site office.  You are not allowed to take photographs with your back shown to the Statue, Dagaba, or the Stupa. I recommend anyone, local or foreign tourists to visit Mihintale, and experience the climb, view of the landscapes, and the sunrise or the sunset from the peak of Mihintale. Anyone would love and enjoy the fleet of steps that makes you climb to the peak. All are welcome to be at Mihintale and enjoy the experience. Will be back with another historic site sooooon.

Buddhism was immediately embraced with fervour by the Sinhalese people and soon became firmly established in the island – unlike in India, its birthplace, where it would subsequently fall into terminal decline.

Shoes have to be left before enterning the main site so take socks to avoid the grit and the heat. There are four main components to the complex at Mihintale and three require climbing up steps/rocks so it's not a good option for anyone with impaired mobility.  The centrepiece in Mihintale is the Ambasthale Dagoba which is where a former King is said to have converted to buddhism. Up some steps to  one side of the main Dagoba is a relatively new white statue of buddha which looks great against the blue sky. On another side is the large Mahaseya Dagoba which offers good views across the area. We visited when it was offering time so were treated to a bit of ceremony. Then there is a tricky rock to climb (especially if you are wearing socks as it can be a bit slippy so think about taking them off briefly) which gives wonderful 360 views of the site and surrounding area, all the way back to Anuradhapura, where you can see varous dagobas in the skyline.

Mihintale is easily reached by bus from Anuradhapura new town bus station, it takes about half an hour and costs 40 rupees. From the bus stop it’s a walk of about 400 metres to the museum which makes for an interesting stop before entering the park itself. Just past the museum you climb a long stone staircase to a landing area where the ticket office is. From this area further sets of stairs lead to the various sites (it has to be said there are lots  of stairs to climb to cover this site properly but if you take it easy it shouldn’t cause a problem). The main route takes you up to the core area of the site where you find the Ambasthale Dagoba, a large seated buddha statue and a rocky viewpoint. The area is peaceful and scenic and the views from the upper levels are stunning. A less travelled set of stairs from the area around the ticket office takes you to the ruined stupa of Et Vihara. If you head this way chances are you’ll be the only one up there and the stairs and path are semi-overgrown.

The ruins at the level of the ticket booth (at the end of Old Road, halfway up the hill) are good for a 15-minute walk-around. The stone canoe at the “alms house” is quite impressive. Apparently, lay people would fill this with rice as donation to the monks who lived here. Don’t miss the lion carved into the side of Lion Rock. Up the hill, there are three peaks forming a triangle around a basin. The basin is not large -- little bigger than a football field. The lowest peak has an imposing modern statue of the Buddha – very easy climb, but not much by way of views from there. The second peak has a huge white stupa; good views from there, especially of the other peaks. The tallest is a steep climb up bare rock (steps cut into the rock with handrails). Great views, but dangerously slippery if wet. Because it’s a sacred place, you have to take off your shoes as you approach the three peaks and basin. Wear old socks if you’re not accustomed to walking on paving stones or sand that is frying-pan hot from the tropical sun. Even if not hot, the sharp grit underfoot makes it painful. Th historical significance of this place has to do with being where a king first accepted Buddhism. Entry was 500 rupees. The site does not seem to have any cafe, toilet or shop selling water -- but then again, I didn't look that carefully. Covering the upper steps and peaks leisurely takes only about 90 minutes. To escape the worst of midday sun, you can start the climb at 4pm and still have plenty of light when you reach the top. But there are plenty of shrine-caves and ruins in the area. If you are intent on visiting them, I think you will need an hour or two more, which means starting much earlier than 4pm. I didn’t bother, as by this point in my visit to the country, I’ve had my fill of Buddhist places. My hotel arranged a tuktuk from Anuradhapura for 4 hours at a cost of 2,000 rupees (leaving little time for shrine-caves). It’s only 13km or 30 minutes journey time. The driver took me to a few other places before reaching the Mihintale peaks. One was a “big tree” monastery (nothing much to see except a big tree and a human skeleton); another was the site of a “hospital” dated to about 800 CE (OK for a 10-minute walk-around); and the third was “Black Water Pool” (more ruins, so-so views). If your hotel does not offer such a service, it’s still very easy to hire a tutktuk from anywhere in Anuradhapura for 3 to 4 hours for a similar price.","June 3, 2018",0.0,0.0

Don't let the 1850 steps out you off! If you can get a three wheeler or driver to take you to the upper car park you're half way there!  The final rock climb can be a bit tricky if you are not fit.  It is not so big at the top of the mountain but it is beautiful. When you go upstairs you van visit the stupa. You can also climb the rock and then you have an amazing view over the countryside. It is one of the religious places in Anurudhapura. Little bit far from the city centre about 7 km.   You have to climb plenty of steps to reach the attraction. You can have a great view around the area once on the top.  From there you can have a breathtaking 360 view. This is a lovely historic place, plenty of steps to climb and most of it is barefoot.  As it is of religious significance, shoulders and legs should be covered and no hats.  My tip would be, if in doubt carry a wrap/sarong/shawl. My other tip would be to carry a pair of socks with you as the ground can get hot. The climb is manageable at a steady pace. However, the very last bit for the view, is one way traffic only. It was uplifting to see that language was not a barrier. We climbed the rock and worshiped.  Everyone should go there to worship this historical place. It is a very holy site and cannot have the shoes on and make sure you have good socks or very strong feet.  It was hot walking barefooted on the rock and suggests wearing socks.  Some of the steps up to the top of the rock are a little slippy and it is not an easy descent, although you can grasp the hard rail. Take a lot of water, although there is a shop to buy drinks. You have to visit and make it to the top of the rock .  Though the huge number of nice steps and the rock climbing seems to be the main part of Mihinthale journey; there are plenty of important things to see around there. One is the relics of the ancient hospital situated in the midway. ""Kaludiya Pokuna (Black water Pond)"" is another interesting place that you should visit that is only 500m away from Mihinthale. We have been there at Sunset and the colors were beautiful. This site has wonderful Dagobas, Bodhi Tree, Buddha and many other interesting curiosities. You get a bonus and that is you can see a very nice sunset if you go there before sunrise. You will see lot of monkey's and you see a big Buddha the Mihintale temple. Don't skip this, it's really worth it. It is a nice site to visit. Note that the climbing is not too difficult. You find a Dagoba, a Buddah statue and rock to climb, an ancient water pool, etc. They are so many different things to see. Just be aware of the monkeys which can be a bit aggressive if you get too close to them. I recommend to you to visit Minintale.","April 22, 2018",0.0,0.0

There is lots to do at the top - stupa, Buddha statue and a lookout rock - and lots of ruins along the way to get to the top so I really didn't notice the number of stairs.

During the season, (Full moon day of June) huge coward, Sri Lankan Buddhist devotees as well as local tourists are coming there. We were offered with free meals, free fruit drinks, coffee and tea which is common practice of during festival days. It is awesome, however not well clean, possibly not so hygienic, because they are serving for large gathering. The peak temple is wonderful and it is worth of worth the climbing to this historical mountain temple, because of the surrounding view. Historical point of view this rock is point of origination of Sri Lankan Buddhism (70% of Sri Lanka are Buddhism devotees). It is believed by Sri Lankans to be the site of a meeting between the Buddhist monk Mahinda and King Devanampiyatissa which inaugurated the presence of Buddhism in Sri Lanka. Now it became famous important Buddhist pilgrimage site in Sri Lanka, which consists of several religious monuments. The first meeting of introducing Buddhism to  King Devanampiyatissa the by a Buddhist monk Mahinda, migrated from India,  who was the son of Emperor Asoka(268 –  232 BC), an Indian emperor of the Maurya Dynasty,  subsequently,  inaugurated the presence of Buddhism in Sri Lanka. Buddhist devotees strongly believe that the  team of Buddhist missioners, who considerd as  envoys of the king, had flown  to Mihintale rock from India by their spiritual power.   Legends state Emperor Asoka converted to Buddhism, after witnessing the mass deaths of the Kalinga War of India. These  are certain historical information connected with Mihintale. As the legend, In Sinhala (Sri Lanka main language ) “Mihin-Thalé” literally means the “plateau of Mihindu”. This is a flat terrain on top of a Mihintale rock, from where the  was supposed to have called King Devanampiyatissa, by the King’s first name to stop him shooting a deer in jungle.","November 11, 2017",0.0,0.0

Once you have responded to conversation they have become your unwanted helpers at an undisclosed fee. As stated earlier, the climb to the pinnacle is quite arduous as one has to climb using small steps carved into the rock (there is a handrail to the top). If you are using the helpers, do yourselves a favour and negotiate a price prior to accepting their help. If you are considering the climb, do so in the early hours of the morning before the rock heats up. We had blistered feet from the experience as it is a temple and footwear is not allowed.

Therefore, we toured with the intent to NOT pay any of the ""Expensive Entry Fees"". The thing about the ruins in Sri Lanka is that only the foundations are left and they are not well kept. The dagobas that have been maintained look brand new. We were advised to take a lunch, which sounded like a great idea, but as soon as we sat down about 20 aggressive moneys appeared, growling and grabbing.  We quickly left, climbed 500 steps and found a security guard sitting in a big cage behind the ticket office. He kindly allowed us to eat our lunch inside the cage while money's drooled outside.

The Stairway is a series of flights, 1843 ancient granite slab steps lead majestically up the hillside. On the second landing I took on the services of a guide (Rs 1000), it is also where the monks’ refectory is located with huge stone troughs that the lay followers kept filled with rice for the monks. Nearby, at a place identified as the mon¬astery’s relic house, are two inscribed stone slabs erected during the reign of King Ma¬hinda IV. The final steep stairway, lined with frangipani trees, leads to the place where Mahinda and the king met. The Am¬basthale Dagoba is built over the spot where Mahinda stood. The bodhi tree to the left of the base of the steps is said to be one of the oldest surviving ones. From here there is a fantastic view over the lakes and trees to Anuradhapu¬ra, a horizon studded with the domes and spikes of all the massive dagobas. The guide did prove valuable as he had to race back up the steps to retrieve my camera that I had left on a bench whilst putting my sandals back on.

If at all possible, do not make the same mistake. It is quite simply the most breathtaking historic religious site we visited in our two week stay in Sri Lanka. There is a board at the bottom of the hill very helpfully stating there are 1800 steps. This may be true in a manner of speaking, but please do not be put off - it is not necessary to do anywhere near that many. From the car park there is a short sloping road up to the ticket office level, and then there are about 200 steps (mostly shaded) to the 'Take your shoes off' cabin (as with every temple in SL take thick socks to avoid burnt feet and constantly dodging sharp stones). From there it's only about 30 more to the central stupa area. This area is shady and relaxing. From this level you can climb to a stunning white buddha (probably only about 50 steps but as they are carved into the rock some are a bit awkward so take care - there is a handrail however). You could also climb from the central area up to the big stupa, that's about another 200 steps (shaded) but definitely worth it for the stunning views and the cool breeze! There are also options from the central area to climb up to sunset rock (we didn't bother, it looked crowded and was nowhere near sunset - the views can't be all that different from the big stupa) and down to some kind of cave art - we got halfway down and gave up as we couldn't face climbing all the way back up afterwards! Please note if you are THAT kind of tourist, there are no sweetie shops, hot dog stands or kiddies playparks here. It is a historical religious site. If you want those things, stay at home. Otherwise, if you can handle the steps (which as stated above are not as numerous as claimed) this place is magical and worth a few hours of anyone's time.

You then have three choices for further climbs. On the advice of our guide, I chose the difficult rock climb first. To get up to the rock you need to navigate up a staircase built into the stone, with a handrail available in the difficult spots. It's quite steep and some of the carved steps are only an inch or two deep, so you need to take it slowly and surely.  Once you reach the top and make it to the narrow platform area the views are spectacular. Going down can be a bit problematic if you are competing for space for those ascending.  It's advisable to hold the handrail at all times but sometimes this isn't possible.  Even if you are wearing walking shoes it can be a bit slippy.  Our guide said barefoot was best but then the rock can get very hot in the sun.  It's one of those descents where you are glad to reach the bottom. After that it's easy to ascend to the temple area using conventional steps. Here the views are almost as good and there is no difficulty to overcome.

It isn't far from the better known site of Anuradhapura, and is well worth visiting as well.  It may not be World Heritage listed, but it is nice and nicer than many places that are. There are a lot of steps leading up to the site - almost 2000 in all.  However if you have transport, you can be driven up to quite near the top and only climb a few of them.  I am unfit and found it perfectly fine climbing from there, I suspect the full climb would be all right too if you started early and took it at a gentle pace. The site consists of several interesting buildings; the ruins of a monastery, two pagodas, a small museum, and a giant sitting Buddha.  There is also a steep rocky viewpoint which can be climbed if you don't mind a bit of a scramble.  The views are wonderful, looking out over the countryside. The area has great religious significance for Buddhists as it is believed to be the site where the first Buddhist king of Sri Lanka was converted to the religion by a group of monks.  The spot where he met the monks is marked by a tree and a nearby very small museum. As it is a religious site, you need to remove your shoes before the final set of steps and leave them with the shoe attendants.  You may keep your socks on, which is a good idea as the ground gets hot here in the open sun.  You should also ensure your shoulders and legs to below the knee are covered.  Hats also need to be removed.  There is limited shade at the top so be sure to where plenty of suncream or take a scarf (which is permitted). I'd highly recommend this site for a visit as it is beautiful and interesting.  It would not be a good place to visit in the rain though as the climb to the top of the viewpoint would be dangerous in wet conditions I think, and the views may not be so good.  It's also quite exposed.  I think children would like it, as there's lots to see.  It's also less crowded than many of the sites I visited in the region and has a peaceful feeling even when there are plenty of people around.","February 23, 2016",0.0,0.0

How to reach there:- Most of the hotel hosts will recommend to hire a tuk tuk driver to reach mihintale which is about 8km from Anuradhapura. You can take bus from Old Anuradhapura and reach mihintale in about half an hour. What to expect:- A typical worship place occupied by buddhist monks during early centuries What you see:- A picturesque landscape of Srilankan country side from the observation peak. View of Buddha and the Dagoba from the peak is also worth the climb, You will be welcomed by the blossoming trees along the climb which makes your climb easier.

But just just the sight of the stairs surrounded by frangipani trees in full blossom make this site a must to visit. It was absolutely beautiful. From there on it's 1800 steps up to the temple and to see beautiful views of the Sri Lankan landscape. The steps are not hard to climb, it will take you ten to twenty minutes. As we went in the afternoon the sundown bathed the whole area in marvelous lights. The icing on the cake was to climb up the viewpoint area on the pointy rock formation. The climb is slightly tough as there are no railings in some places and it's pretty steep, but it's well worth it as the view from the top is just amazing. The minor adrenaline rush from climbing up also gives the experience that little extra. To be honest the place was my best experience so far in Sri Lanka after being here two weeks so far and after being to both Lion rock and Adams peak which both can be compared to this site.
