We didn’t enjoy the experience for a few reasons. Our car worked well and took us around no problems but it was not 4x4 and the roads are really bad. I often felt the car would get stuck so felt fearful the whole trip. We asked that they cut our journey short because of this. The check in and check out process was really terrible - it took such a long time for them to decide how much to charge us despite a sign on the wall saying 10$ for tourists plus 8% VAT - they couldn’t work it out and charged us more and also for extras. This took a very long time and whilst they were working it out, the guys were taking photos of us. When the safari finished they asked us for another 1000 rupees because they had worked out the original calculation wrong. We said no and left. Most importantly, the safari. It was not good. We saw some monkeys, deer and other common animals. We saw elephants but they were just far away. Half way through the safari we were taken to a museum which was full of elephants which had been shot. I feel they need to get 4x4 cars or improve the tracks, improve the entrance process, and run safaris at times when they believe you would actually see animals.","May 18, 2022",0.0,0.0

It took one hour to get there from our guest house in Maha Oya so if you are intending to do this, you need a long time. We were offered a six hour trip but we reduced it to four. Inside the park the bird life, especially by the lake, was very good indeed. We saw painted storks, a Brahmani Kite, kingfishers and numerous others. We were disappointed with the lack of large animals to see - we saw deer in a couple of places, wild buffalo and elephants that were mainly in the distance. Ironically, we had much better sightings of elephants from the jeep as we travelled along the road to and from the park. Overall we had no regrets about going as the scenery and birds were great, but it was an expensive afternoon for what we saw overall.","January 23, 2018",0.0,0.0

There was no one at the entrance to give us tickets. The man in charge had left the place to go visit his friends. We had to spend a lot of time there because one worker had to get his motorcycle to go find the keys to open the box to put the money he would charge from us. The park itself was wild & very green, but there were no tourists at all. Unfortunately, the jeep we had rented had very poor traction, and we could not pass through most of the deep mud. We had to turn around and go on a flat road on which we saw no animals. After spending a lot of money for the jeep and the park fees, we could see only one elephant. Our advice to tourists is to check the tires of the jeep before renting it because roads are very poor inside the park. If possible, call ahead of time to see if the ticket agent is at duty so that you do not have wait there for a long time. This visit was a total disappointment.","January 8, 2018",0.0,0.0

It took us about 2 hours to reach the national park due to poor stretches of road and we werent in a 4-wheel drive. When we reached the park office, we found that the guide with the jeep was not available. We waited almost 2 hours for him to come to the office. By the time we started to enter the park it was almost noon. There were no animals to be seen. We saw a few elephants from far. Some spotted deer. That's it. The hordes of elephants that we hoped to see were not there. I think the time of day was not right to view the animals. Would recommend going early in the morning or evenings.

It was not expensive. We drove through some very rural Sri Lanka on the way to the park, and once we were in felt like we'd found a truly wild place. We were the only visitors to the park that day and after about 40 minutes of bumping around through scrub and forest emerged into an open landscape with a lake. We spent some time around the lake and the fringes of the forest where we saw about a dozen elephants that seemed like they weren't used to seeing many people. After that we spent a couple more hours driving around with our driver keen to find more elephants. We saw several dozen more, the highlight of which was about half an hour spent watching a group of seven elephants including a very young one and a couple of other slightly bigger youngsters with their mums from less than 50 metres. Truly fantastic seeing wild animals in a wild place. This was our only National Park excursion, that we chose specifically to avoid the crowds. The Lonely Planet rated it as the 'worst national park in Sri Lanka'. I can't compare it to any others and we only saw elephants, but if isolation, tranquility and elephants is what you're after, then I can't fault this place. It also felt nice to put some money into the coffers of an obviously under-resourced park. Our driver (and park guide who came too) spoke no English, but were extremely friendly.

The real wild. This place is unlike the majority of other National Parks in Sri Lanka: the jeeps are few, and the wildlife is plentiful. Highlights included a number of rare birds, elephants that were far less tame than in other parks, and numerous deer. A fantastic safari where one feels as though the park is almost entirely reserved for one's own use: you don't compete with the same number of jeeps as elsewhere.","August 12, 2017",0.0,0.0

It started well at the small reception area where we transitioned from car to jeep....high in a tree we saw our first indigenous species of the furry kind. A Giant Squirrel, the size of a large domestic cat, plus a rare sighting of the Paradise Flycatcher. From the perspective of different animal sightings, it was quite difficult from then on. We did see elephants and some bird species . Two problems... the first being that the Park is so very little visited that the animals are very wary and vary from not being seen at all to keeping a fair distance away, unlike other parks we visited. The photographic opportunities were few and far between. The second problem is that there are very few roads /tracks, so very little of the park can be traversed and the animals are spread so far apart. The forestry commission need to invest in this park for it to remain viable. It is a most beautiful place, with lush green vegetation and trees; a veritable paradise, but unless the animals are more compartmentalised and more visible, by creating a network of vehicle tracks, it will not pay its way. I do hope this park thrives, but it will only do so with more investment and thus more tourism.","March 20, 2017",0.0,0.0

We had the park to ourself instead of the usual twenty or more other jeeps, which was fantastic.   It is however not for the faint hearted as fewer tourists and jeeps also means the elephants are much wilder than other parks and we actually got charged by a large bull and trapped by another with a stand off for some minutes before he backed off and let us past.  Lot's of trumpeting and rushing into the bushes to protect their young.  The landscape is also truly stunning.  Not to be missed if you want a more authentic exhilirating experience.

The reservoir is shallow and the kids loved to play in the water. On the other side of the reservoir you can see elephants, deer, dancing peacocks etc. In the tree right at the bungalow there was a grey hornbill nesting. Just hanging out at the bungalow was very nice and relaxing. We also did two safaris. We were there in April and didn't really see many animals. But the landscapes are beautiful. We never saw other people despite it being school holidays. So I would recommend it for families with small children to get a ""soft start"" into wildlife watching.

Also you can visit to see the Maduru Oya Dam which was constructed within whooping 3 years (1980-1983) under Cursory Mahaweli Project. Worth visiting this valued place and i do recommend the Enderaetamulla Wild Life Department Circuit Bungalow if you plan to visit this National Park.","January 28, 2014",0.0,0.0

The place is filled with them. We saw more than 300 of them in different groups. Many elephants also call this park home, along with many wild boar & water buffaloes. There're two entrances to the park. One from Aralaganwilla & the other from Mahiyanganaya side. However Aralaganwila side entrance is the most popular. The ancient Veddas of Dambana also live inside the Maduru Oya National Park even though they're prohibited to hunt the animals. The Hennanigala archaeological site is also situated inside the park. Before coming to Aralaganwila, you can visit the Dimbulagala Temple (a steep climb) & the hotest hot water well in Sri Lanka - ""Nelum Wewa"" Hot Water Wells with a temperature of 62 degrees of Celsius.","July 15, 2013",0.0,0.0
