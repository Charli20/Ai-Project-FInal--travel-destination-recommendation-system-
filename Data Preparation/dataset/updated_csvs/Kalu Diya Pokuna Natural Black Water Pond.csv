Mahinda was the son of great Mauryan King Asoka. Sinhalese king accepted the invitation and Buddhism soon spread as state religion. Mihintale temple is situated on the top of a hill, led by 1850 steps with seven platforms. These steps are believed to have been laid out during the reign of King Bhathika Abhaya (22 BC–AD 7). Mihintale is studded with many important shrines, stupas, caves, ponds and sacred places. One of such places is called pond of Black Water. It is a very peaceful place for meditation or solitary picnic. The pond is believed to be a source of supply of water to the monastery attached with the temple a thousand years ago.
