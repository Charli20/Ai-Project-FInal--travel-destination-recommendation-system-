We went on the strength of the reviews which billed this place as some where the birds were genuinely well looked after. Nothing could be further from the truth! We left the place within half an hour of arriving; we were shocked and saddened by the conditions in which these poor creatures were kept. The birds are all housed in cages that are far too small. Moreover, many of the cages are placed in deep shade. The location of the park itself, is set in very beautiful grounds with a multitude of trees, flowers and shrubs. Such a setting feels particularly cruel given the horrible living conditions of the birds and the fact that they can see the vast space outside the confines of their horrible cages. Most of the birds were silent and clearly in distress. Few showed any animation even when we stood very close by and tried to interact with them. One cockatoo was especially sad-looking with its head bowed. There were two geese placed inside a tiny cage, approximately a 3m square space. There was literally a muddy puddle that constituted as a pond.","September 19, 2025",0.0,0.0

There was no shuttle service provided for the 600-meter walk, which was inconvenient. The entrance fee did not reflect the value of the experience offered. The park housed a limited number of bird species, many of which were kept in small cages. While they advertise the opportunity to ""touch"" the birds, you're not actually allowed to do so yourself , staff place the birds on your shoulder or hand, and this comes with an extra charge. Feeding the birds is also an additional cost. Once your purchased seeds run out, staff abruptly remove the birds and ask you to leave the enclosure. If you wish to stay longer, you're required to buy more seeds. Overall, the experience felt overly commercialized and lacked genuine care for both the birds and the visitors.","August 9, 2025",0.0,0.0

It's a lovely setting, but many of the birds are in poor condition and seem to be disturbed and/or bored. Some birds are on their own and some look ill. The cages also are appalling. The whole experience made me feel depressed, and I didn't stay long. This is not an animal sanctuary, it's a theme park that plays music to slit your wrists to when you enter. Looks like a money making pursuit, nothing more. I tried to explain this to a woman parading a macaw, and she just asked me if I wanted to be photographed with the macaw. Please, don't support this venture, it's a cruel, but disguised, form of animal exploitation.","March 12, 2025",0.0,0.0

We only visited because we had come to the tea museum, which was closed and as this was next door we decided to pay the park a visit.

This is not a bird sanctuary but a bird park for kids. Do not expect the birds to be flying fee. I am glad I disregarded the reviews. This park is thoughtfully designed for children. My 3 year old was able to walk most of the 1.3 kms on his own. Lovely collection of birds. Totally worth the Rs.700 we spent. I am also respectful of not allowing outside food. They had enough choices inside the park.,"January 25, 2025",0.0,0.0

It's better to go to the Pinnawala zoo than to pay 700 and see this concrete. It's the most unfair thing to pay.

While you do get to see a variety of birds, I believe you can experience more at Dehiwala Zoo for a better price. There aren’t any good restaurants inside, and outside food isn’t allowed, so plan accordingly. The park’s landscape is quite hilly, so get ready for a mini hike – not surprising given its location in the Hanthana mountain range. If you’re using a navigation app, I recommend following the route via Bogambara Bus Stand instead of Heerassagala, as the latter has poor road conditions. For those relying on public transportation, there’s a bus passing by the park, but be sure to check the schedule at Kandy. Tuk-tuks are available at the park gate, and while PickMe might work, it’s uncertain in this area. If you need to take a tuk, make sure to negotiate the fare beforehand. Overall, the experience was okay, but definitely not worth the price.","October 6, 2024",0.0,0.0

You can't bring any food items inside and there are some restaurant with average quality food collection. Extremely complex and stupid floor map arrangement! you can feed birds but you to have buy separate tickets and have to pay for foods also for 3min work. Well maintained garden with cool environment. Big parking space. Recommend to visit there when clear sky mode is on🙂,"June 26, 2024",0.0,0.0
