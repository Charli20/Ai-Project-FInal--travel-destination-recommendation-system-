Embekka Devalaya was the first stop, not far from a bus stop coming from Kandy. The trek allows you to visit 3 temples built in different ages and materials. This dates back to the 1300s and many parts are in well-preserved wood. The most architecturally significant element is the Drummers' Hall, with wooden pillars that bring hundreds of beautiful carvings to the top and a very particular roof with beams tilted from above towards the visitor and fixed together in place by a giant pin, of which nothing equivalent can be found elsewhere. But the place itself is really beautiful, with a huge body tree and still quite unfrequented by tourists.  It was here that we discovered, with surprise and admiration, how a Buddhist temple in Sri Lanka can host Hindu deities.","December 7, 2024",0.0,0.0

Entrance fee of LKR300 per person is well worth the penny for 30-45 mins visit especially anyone into wood carvings. We also saw group of students here for study excursion at this historical place. Visiting this temple can be combined with visits to Lankathilaka Temple & Temple of Galadenia where these Temples are within 30 mins drive to each other.

I think this is the place I have visited where there are the nice and best carvings. I reached to this place from Kandy. I came via Colombo Kandy A1 road and then from Peradeniya I used google maps to find this place. It is not so far from Kandy. When you visit this place please take  time to watch carvings. Because you can see nice architectural work on roof too.,"April 7, 2017",0.0,0.0

Located using Google Maps. There is an old man at entrance who guided us for a small tip. When we arrived there was a religious ceremony taking place so we waited half an hour before we could see the whole temple. There are some unique wood carvings on the pillars of the temple. Also it is worth reading the history of the temple to appreciate it. It is completely different from the Budhist Temples you see in the Heritage Sites. Also there are 2 other temples nearby so it is worth travelling to this area. I appreciated the lack of crowds and huge entrance fees which you have to pay at other sites.","February 26, 2017",0.0,0.0

This shrine has richly carved wooden pillars which are beautiful. A pleasant old man may walk you around (un-necessarily) for a tip (he was sweet, not annoying).
