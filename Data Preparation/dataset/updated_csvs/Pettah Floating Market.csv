The Pettah Market is located on the island of Bastian Mawata and partly on the waters of Lake Beira right in the centre of Colombo. The organizers planned that the street vendors would move into concrete rows and visitors could, in addition to shopping, also ride on the lake in boats shaped like white swans. 92 shopping pavilions stretch along the canal with dirty water. Most of the pavilions are empty. The market was opened in 2014 and it was planned that its proximity to Colombo Fort railway station and bus station would make it in demand among tourists, but something went wrong and now it is a deserted and uninteresting place, which is not worth visiting.","December 7, 2024",0.0,0.0

Found everything we were looking for but my advice is this...if you know what you are wanting, ask someone where you might find it or you could be walking for hours! Wear light appropriate clothing, comfortable footwear, and bring bottled water. You will find a mix of quality items from leather to to fake leather. As is with the jewelry, as I noticed most said gold plated. Prices are very good but not all vendors will bargain with you. They told us a price and he wouldn't go any lower and actually let us leave his shop without coming down in price!!We did eventally go back and buy the shoes because they were a fantastic deal anyway.
