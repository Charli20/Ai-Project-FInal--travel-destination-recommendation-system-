The cost for foreigners is 30 USDollar, without any kind of discount. If you can swallow and pay the amount, a tour of the museum is interesting. Don't hold high expectations: it's a museum with some slightly more modern parts but most of the display isn't very eye-catching. But if you have the patience and time to read some explanations, your visit will also be better and more conscious. Sometimes the guardians spend a few words of explanation out of kindness (or perhaps because they expect a tip?). Outside the Museum you will be engulfed by many guides who will offer to accompany you both to the museum and to the excavations. It may be worth it for the latter (for us it was a boon: we saved a lot of time in the huge archaeological site and acted as an interpreter in a misadventure we had that day), but not for the museum: if you want to save a little something, visit it yourself.","November 25, 2024",0.0,0.0

We then were completely lost as to where to go - there was no signage at all and no map offered.  We were told by the guide to go and see the museum first and it was interesting but should then lead you out to the ruins behind.  Consequently we walked around the car park lost, trying to find an entrance and then followed others with a guide.  After that our driver took us round to the main site on the other side of the road.  People were hawking bike hire but to be honest if you have a tuk tuk / car then just drive to each site, walk around and then go to next..  The area is extensive and I would not recommend trying to walk it in the heat.  It is visually very pretty and the few boards around the site seemed to keep repeating themselves.  Most people just read from their guide books like us!  It would be a great help if by the museum entrance / exit there were maps to show you where to go.

Entrance fee is $25 ($12.50 for children) including the visits to the citadel. SAARC member countries get a discount if you would show  your passport and you get a 50% discount on the entry fee. (Like Sigriya) This is a great place to start a trip to Polonnaruwa, particularly as its models of the city’s buildings allow visitors to figure just about the ruins to be seen. It is located close to the Prakkrama Samudraya (meaning the sea which is made from joining of 3 Tanks), this museum is a must watch if you are interested about the Polonnaruwa history. Archaeological museum in Polonnaruwa is where the traveler should start his exploration before visiting the conserved historical sites. It gives you so much of information which helps to appreciate what you see later on in the ruined city. There are many models of the key. This is the best place to get information on history of Polonnaruwa  and is recommended for both locals and foreigners. You have to go to the museum to buy entrance tickets to the site. It is worth spending some time looking at the exhibits as they have models of what the ruins must have looked like in their heyday. The beautiful museum which houses an amazing bronze of Nataraja, and Parvati (in Tara Style) - Don't ever miss it. The Polonnaruwa Archaeological Museum exhibits finds excavated from the medieval city of Polonnaruwa, a UNESCO-listed site.  Interesting stone boxes with offerings. Dancing Shiva Nataraja in bronze. Really worth the visit (better before the ruins) It is an extremely  informative museum despite its humble Outlook and gives you some impressions about Polonnaruwa as former capital. The exhibits are categorized and presented, and the remodeled items are very interesting too. We got impressed by the models of how the ruins originally looked before the fires. A great idea is that it brought to life the ruins once you actually saw them. We learned many things from here. There were many historical things on display. Stone sculptures of Hindu deities, Buddhas and Bodhisattva and fragments of columns were on display. The museum is very well organised: it displays archaeological remains recovered from the site as well as scale models of the citadel's buildings; it also provides detailed information about the artifacts displayed as well as on the history of the citadel and its surroundings. We got a very interesting guided tour (free) led by an archaeologist. On the first room, a large model of the city and ruins gives an idea of how enormous the kingdom was.  Many photos of the monuments  were shown before and after restoration. It and around an hour is enough for visit. It has few rooms that dedicates to different topics. Each room has very good selections of exhibits with titles in English. We enjoyed a lot models of former capital and its buildings. It helped us to imagine them when we saw ruins. Museum has small shop with interesting selections of the  books of interest. We are really glad that we visited museum. It's really worth an hour of our visit. I recommend you to visit Archaeological Museum of Polonnaruwa.","November 3, 2017",0.0,0.0

Just OK.  There were definitely some cool artifacts but I got the idea that some of the things on display were fake.  I am no expert but some items just didn't add up.  There were also hundreds of numbered pictures on the walls that had no descriptions to explain what there were.  Even some of the physical displays of artifacts had no explanations with them. The personnel there are very adamant about no picture taking because the museum wants to make money off you through forcing you to buy photos from the gift shop if you want photos of the displays.  Problem was, the photo rack had about 8 photos in it for purchase and didn't seem to have been restocked for some time.  This was a frustrating rip off. I would not have even gone through the museum under normal circumstances because I would have hired a local guide.  Trouble is, the tourism ministry in Sri Lanka mandated that prices between foreign tourists and locals be extremely offset.  I think locals paid less than 50 (fifty) rupees to enter while I had to pay 5,500 (five thousand five hundred), which amounts to USD 35.  That sapped my budget for a local guide, effectively taking money out of the local market.  It was this way at all the national monuments in that tourists payed outrageously more than locals.  I am all for charging more for foreign tourists because foreign wages are much better than local wages, but come on.  I was unable to help out a local guide because I had to give the museum ticket office all my money.  The ticket included entrance to the museum and all the sites.","September 7, 2016",0.0,0.0

That way you are able to contextualise and put in historical lineage the sites and monuments. Otherwise some of them can look like a bunch of rocks to you. There a number of multi lingual guides around who will offer to take you around the sites. Make sure you speak to a couple and be comfortable with their story telling style or you might get some one who forgets the tree for the forest. As per other museums in Sri Lanka, no photography. Put your iPad/iPhone away or risk it being rudely grabbed off you. If you are a Hindu history buff, some great early bronzes are on display at the back of the museum. These artefacts would only be behind glass and rope, in other parts of the world, so take a moment and absorb their magnificence.","January 1, 2016",0.0,0.0

It's not big and around an hour is enough for visit. It has few rooms that dedicates to different topics. Each room has very good selections of exhibits with titles in English. There are very beautiful bronze statuettes of Shiva as well. There are also many nice photos and information about Polonnaruwa archaeological sites. We enjoyed a lot models of former capital and its buildings. It helped to imagine them when we saw ruins. Museum has small shop with interesting selections of thematic books. We are really glad that we visited museum. It's really worth an hour.,"December 29, 2015",0.0,0.0

We'd recommend then moving swiftly onto  the site itself (given that your ticket is only vaid for the day) and then returning to the museum later in the day when you will appreciate the air-conditioning and be able to relate some of the museum's reconstructions of what you've seen for yourself. The museum contains some amazing Shiva statues as well as further information on the archaeological ruins. The museum has a small bookshop and clean toilets (but no refreshments / cafe). Staff can be rather officious.","December 17, 2015",0.0,0.0

This museum is the best starting point for you to get some background and information about the ruins. The pity is that while there are models/recreations of parts of the site/ruins it is not easy to relate them to what you will see later in the ruined city. A standout overhead plan showing the city from above which then leads you to separate parts and recreations/visualizations of those parts would have helped me gain a greater understanding. This is still a good site and one at which you can get information to give you the background to the ruins. If you like history you should go, if you don't like history you should still go just in case this is what spurs you to become interested in the rise and fall of civilisations.","December 6, 2015",0.0,0.0
