For me it was the first safari and so novelty always strikes, but without wow. Needless to say, with all the jeeps we did not see the leopard 🐆. Some elephants, peacocks, buffalo, pelicans, mongooses, deer and crocodiles. We only saw the elephants up close amidst a multitude of jeeps (our driver was good).

When a leopard was spotted, many of the jeep drivers reacted very aggressively, driving extremely fast and without consideration for safety or the animals. It was upsetting to see that they seemed to care only about spotting the leopard, while ignoring other wildlife and the well-being of the park. The reckless driving took away from what should have been a respectful and memorable nature experience. Overall, it did not feel like responsible or ethical wildlife tourism, which was very disappointing.","January 4, 2026",0.0,0.0

The driver Heshan and our guide Sanka were professionals, we were traveling with them daily and booked them through our lodge (Koragaha), they work for several hotels. There were never any problems and we probably saw everything except the bears. Unbelievable also what Heshan could still see while driving. Thanks to the guys’ experience, after waiting 1.5 hours we could see a leopard coming out of the bush right in front of our car without dozens of other vehicles around us. I would definitely book the safari directly with an accommodation, even if it is more expensive than outside. The reasons are quite simple, you not only have a driver, but also a guide with you, you don't have to buy a ticket, you can pass right in the morning at 6 o'clock directly to the gate because registered and booked online by the hotel. 90% of national park visitors can buy their ticket first and are then allowed to queue up in the sometimes very long motorcade on the left at the gate and they also have no guide in the car.

On the plus side: if you take a good guide, you will be happy. Animals, birds, plants abound. We drove and turned our heads) saw hare, monkeys, mongooses, elephants, leopards, herds of all kinds of horns. But there are downsides, of course: the biggest downside is a deranged toilet cleaner. First of all, there's no paper in the toilets, wipe your sleeve or not at all, the janitor sits right under the open door of the women's toilet - very unpleasant. If you have to throw away diapers, personal hygiene products or if your child has vomited in a bag and you haven't thrown it in the bushes yet for reasons of conscience - the janitor will literally chase you and break into the booth screaming no-no-no. When asked what to do with this bag, he says take it to the Jeep. You know that's surprising and outrageous. It would be nice if the job description were explained to him... there's a lot of garbage in Sri, and there will be a reserve with such a tourist-oriented nature. The second downside is sometimes unrolled roads, washed out and the jeep dives into a huge puddle or runs parallel to the ground. Other than that, I really enjoyed it and the whole group was excited. We had a wonderful guide and a wonderful driver. Thank you for this opportunity. These are the right zoos)","December 20, 2025",0.0,0.0

Yala claims the 3rd position in the world just behind Yellowstone in USA and Banff in Canada. The park is a haven for an impressive array of wildlife, prominently featuring the Sri Lankan leopard (Yala boasts the highest leopard density in the world), Sri Lankan elephants, sloth bears, and mugger crocodiles. Other resident wild cats include the jungle cat, fishing cat, and rusty-spotted cat. Our mid-afternoon safari lasted over three hours, taking us over off-road bumpy terrain. We observed a variety of animals, most frequently peacocks, but also a Bengal monitor, Asiatic wild water buffalos, purple-faced langur monkeys, spotted deers, Asian elephants, mugger crocodiles, a ruddy mongoose, a termite hill gecko, and a leopard resting high in a tree. Despite the excitement of the leopard sighting, the overall volume and variety of animals observed didn't feel commensurate with the extended duration and bumpy nature of the drive. The high volume of tourist jeeps, which often crowd around a single sighting, also impacted the sense of an authentic wilderness experience.","November 5, 2025",0.0,0.0

The tyre of the Jeep was already damaged but nobody seemed to care.  I immediately had the impression that the guide wanted to show us a leopard. Elephants or other animals were stopped only briefly or not at all. Then the guide apparently got a radio message that a leopard had been sighted. Immediately, 10-15 jeeps headed that way. There was a lot of pressure, everyone wanted to be the first. Our driver drove recklessly until we finally saw the leopard. A huge jeep ball was created, another jeep drove us into the side and damaged the tire even more. The return trip to the camp could only be done in the crotch mpo.  All the passengers were scared.

During the three days we spent at the bungalow within the park we were able to have some close encounters with Leopards. That was definitely the icing on the cake but we also spotted many species of birds and mammals. Established in 1938, Yala National Park is one of the best places to spot wildlife in Sri Lanka. Located on the island’s south coast, Yala encompasses open grasslands, sand dunes, dense forests and lagoons. Covering an area of 979 square kilometers, here you can find several big mammals like the Sri Lankan Leopard, Sloth Bear and the Asian Elephant in addition to over 180 species of migratory birds that visit the coastal lagoons of the deep south of Sri Lanka during the winter.","October 13, 2025",0.0,0.0

As we were staying at a hotel nearby, the pickup and drop-off were at the hotel. Both trips were really enjoyable and we were lucky to spot a leopard on both. There’s no denying that the park does get very busy, so it’s not like a private game reserve in South Africa, for example. You’re often not seeing animals ‘in the wild’ when you’re in a queue of 30 or so vehicles, so be prepared for some traffic jams! That said, it’s a big park so you can frequently find yourselves alone, and it only gets crowded when everyone congregates in an area where something like a leopard has been sighted. Our driver, Chamara, was great: he offered plenty of information along the route, and found leopards on both safari drives, so couldn’t have asked for more. Yala National Park is undoubtedly busy, but certainly worth visiting for the opportunity to see a variety of wildlife.","October 12, 2025",0.0,0.0

You should not compare it with safaris in Africa. We saw a few elephants, pelicans, pheasants, a mongoose, an eagle, a crocodile, some deer, and the animal that all 4x4s are looking for and this in a fortuitous way, on the track on the way out. This ended our ride a little ""shaken"" in a more positive way. Sri Lankans and tourists alike celebrate this park.

Not nearly as crowded as other reviews have suggested (except when one jeep spotted a leopard and seemingly all the other jeeps in the park rushed to the spot).  We went for a whole day, which worked well;  contrary to advice, none of the tours saw a leopard in the morning but we did see one at 5.20 at night. One tank we dubbed “crocodile city” - it had so many crocodiles in it.  They would try to sneak up on storks but failed to catch them;  maybe they succeed sometimes, or there would not be so many. The compulsory lunch stop at a big concrete building next to the beach was very pleasant,  presumably the heavy concrete and steel structure was built to be tsunami proof after the devastating 2006 tsunami wiped out all the coastal area of Yala.","September 11, 2025",0.0,0.0

They are all there but possibly avoid the roads with noisy jeeps. For the first 3 hours we were disappointed. Saw lots of Water Buffalo and Peacocks, a mongoose, monkeys and squirrels and a single elephant. Then in about 30 minutes on the way out we came across a big snake, jackal, crocodile and (what we had dreamed about) a leopard leisurely crossing the road right in front of us and slowly ambling off into the bush. Most of the other jeeps we came across had seen almost nothing, so we were lucky. You pay your money, its not a zoo,  so nothing is guaranteed. Was it value for US$150?

We definitely preferred Safari to Udawalawe, so in my opinion, if you have little time and you have to decide, I would opt for another park. In fact Udawalawe has several advantages: 1. The price is lower 2. It is located in a less crowded area even in August and therefore there are far fewer jeeps (something really not to be underestimated) 3. There are few leopards, but I found that even in Yala you rarely see them, so, you might as well 4. There are a lot of elephants, more than in Yala, and I had the chance to see them up close 5.

We had booked two safaris, one in the evening and one in the morning, and we could not see leopards. And disappointment is not only because of that, it is because of the experience itself. In the park, thickets and low trees abound, and visibility is very limited on both sides of the road. Only occasionally do you open views of a pool or lagoon. In these lagoons you can see some crocodiles and different birds, but larger animals are very scarce. In the two days we only saw three elephants and a small bear for a few seconds, and it was because they were on the track. This causes long queues of jeeps to form immediately with nervous tourists waiting for their turn to see something. In addition, there is no radio communication between the cars, so as it is a large park, the sighting possibilities drop a lot. They are many hours on sandy and bumpy roads, with poor visibility and many SUVs. These also have no bare roof, so you can’t stretch or cool off. We have done safaris in Africa and any of them far exceeds this one, as you enjoy the views and the animals are easy to see. Sri Lanka is a wonderful country, but don’t put much expectation on animal viewing safaris (except Mihintale to see herds of elephants) or they will ruin your trip.","July 18, 2025",0.0,0.0

Things are going wrong here. I have already been able to go on a safari in another country and I am very disappointed with how the rabbit runs here. Well over 20-30 cars at one entrance. You chase the animals, our driver drove way too fast, the cars are only occupied by 2 people. This alone could have reduced the number of cars. Nobody explained anything about flora or fauna to us. If an animal has been sighted, then briefly stopped, pointed at it and on. We are still in a park here where the animals live and clearly we are encroaching on their space, but zero attention is paid to it. During the break we stood around a pond with 5 and more cars, where the drivers then had a loud conversation. In addition, we were ripped off in terms of price and had to pay 48,000 instead of 24,000 rupies. For one of us cruising the park. Total waste and I am very disappointed. It's a shame.","September 29, 2024",0.0,0.0

We often travel with our son and relatives as we are very fond of nature. We have seen many leopards and bears during the same half day safari and sometimes none. It all depends with timing, the climate and definitely luck! I can assure that even without a siting of an animal the ride can be joyous just staring at the luscious trees, shrubs and the water bodies.

The animals were hard to find, and I like that, but a great reward when you do see them. They are sufficiently wary. It doesn’t feel like a zoo. And I like that the vehicles have to stay on the tracks, unlike in African parks. But….. there are too many vehicles. It spoils the experience for tourists, and it bothers the animals. There were traffic jams! Unbelievable. Yala NP - you need to reimpose a vehicle quota per day. I’m sure you’ll still achieve the revenue with the high entrance fees.","August 19, 2024",0.0,0.0

A 3-hour morning safari (6am to 9), and/or a 3-hour afternoon safari (3pm to 6).  Everybody has to be in 6-person open viewing jeeps.  Local tour guides charge about $50-60 to hire a full jeep for a 3-hour session, whereas local hotels charge +$50 per person for the same jeep.  Everybody has to pay park fees which are about $33 per person (only very small children are cheaper). The area in which the jeeps patrol is at the gates and called Block 1, which is along the coast and is about 10 miles by 5 miles.  You will see herds of buffalo at the water, mostly likely some elephants, warthogs, and various birds. The leopards are more elusive, and not guaranteed on every trip.  When one is spotted, many jeeps converge.  We did three trips and saw a leopard in the distance on one, were very close to a leopard on another (standing on a rock), and didn't see one on our third.","August 15, 2024",0.0,0.0

The driver, Shamika, was amazing, not sure how he saw the mongoose, the land monitor lizard whilst driving. Very reasonable, and even gave us a cup of ceylon tea that his mum had prepared for him ❤.

We was also fortunate to whitness a mother leopard and her two cubs less than fifthteen minutes into the National Park. The natural scenery is breath taking, there are huge natural stuctures which look similar to Sigiriya and lakes filled with flowers where elephants swim. We also were able to take a break at the designated area for the wash-room, and if I remember correctly there looked to be a café. This was located close to the beach which is connected to the National Park. There you will find a small built up area with one or two buildings providing these facilities. If you do decide to visit I would recommend doing so early in the morning, so around 5am is when you should aim to be there.","April 22, 2024",0.0,0.0

Our jeep driver was lovely and very experienced.  We arrive at the park 30 mins later.  There must have been around 120 jeeps waiting to get in.  Leopards were spotted early on but due to the volume of vehicles and tourists shouting, they shot off and were not seen again. Our guide told us they are allowing far too many vehicles to drive through the park and so now leopards are very diffcult to spot.  Most jeeps were 8-12 seaters with only 2 guests in each one, We did however see elephants, water buffalo, crocodiles and all sorts of birds. An elephant with 2 babies walked right past our jeep - we could have reached out and touched them.  But again, very noisy R*****n tourists actually shouted at them and scared them off. Perhaps some rules should be spoken through, advising folk how to behave.","March 11, 2024",0.0,0.0
