It stands proud in the middle of the city's upper class suburbs. This hall look like a concrete copy of the original Magul Maduwa called as the King’s Court in Kandy which is made out of wood. However the Independence hall is larger and more suitable to mark as the Independence monument from Britain. Sri Lanka culture is reflected in this memorial hall. It is a Long Hall with many concrete pillars and no walls except the roof. But the pillars and cross bars in the Kandy King’s Court is wooden and carved to make more beautiful and attractive. A beautiful monument which shows the culture and pride of Sri Lanka stands outside, replete with statue and flags, to mark Sri Lankan independence. The structure is huge with interesting moldings on its pillars and walls. At night, it looks even better with lighting. The hall itself is beautiful with high ceilings that provide surprising solution to the day's heat. It is cool inside the Independence Hall without A/C as the blowing continuously comes in. The murals on display are a treat to look at. Independence Arcade is located very close to the Independence hall. Sometimes the Independence Hall is used for certain important government functions. The present President, Hon Mitripala Sirisena gave his oaths at the independence hall when elected.

Its design is based on that of the Royal Audience Hall of the Kingdom of Kandy where the Kandyan Convention (ending the independence of that kingdom) was signed with the British in 1815. A team of local and expatriate architects designed the building the construction of which began in 1949 and was completed in 1953. It was from a similarly-shaped hall that the Duke of Gloucester opened the first Parliament of independent Ceylon on 4 February 1948. In front of the Hall, and facing the newly-refurbished Arcade-Independence Square is the statue of the first Prime Minister and ""Father of the Nation"", Mr D S Senanayake.

Great timbers carved tell the story of Buddhism, the Independence and everything that celebrates Sri Lanka.  Great photo moment...take time to take in the history. Word of caution though:  an older man, aptly named ' the teacher' approached our tuk tuk driver (and yes, it was rigged, they knew each other) takes you on a tour around the hall, describing some of the history along the way. This is a free attraction….open to the public and the elements!  But for his time of 15 minutes, we respectfully tipped him…..then he said it was 2,000 Rupees per person.  What 4,000 Rupees for a 15 minute chat?  When you pay less than that….he will barrage you with ‘did you not like my tour?, did it not make you happy?, you wouldn’t have known any of what this means, I am a teacher.’  He will say this as he shoulders alongside you as you try to get into the tuk tuk, in fact, the tuk tuk drivers stall thinking this will change your mind.  It actually takes you to tell him to drive off. Unfortunately this is very common in Colombo (and Kandy as it so happens) so best to say ‘no tour thanks’ and walk away….don’t look bad….because we felt like we were open wallets for everything the tuk tuk driver drove us to.

Mainly tourist visit this area but I am sure that many people visit this place to gain some respite from the heat of the sun. This majestic stone edifice commemorates Sri Lanka gaining its independence from the British Empire in 1948. The exact location is where Prince Henry, the Duke of Gloucester, opened Sri Lanka’s first parliament on a special podium, bringing an end to almost five centuries of colonial rule and marking the beginning of Sri Lanka’s self-rule. Originally, the Independence Memorial Hall hosted important diplomatic guests and ceremonial assemblies of the two houses of the Parliament. In Order to appreciate this monument to freedom, one should make mental notes of the various symbolic references carved into the stone work.  Then go and research why certain symbols were used. But also spend some time in the nearby arcade. Arcade - Independence Square is located in Colombo 7 and is part of the process of beautifying Colombo. Well worth visiting this at the same time to get a nice cup of tea or a cool drink.  But also you can shop in some of the more trendy shops.  Try it!
