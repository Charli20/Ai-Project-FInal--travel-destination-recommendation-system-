A pleasant place to go, especially if you have a small child who’s happy with a play area and doesn’t expect anything very sophisticated. All children below 12 years of age must be accompanied by an adult. This is a pretty large park, full of trees, flowerbeds, even topiary—bushes shaped into elephants, rabbits, and other creatures. There are several spaces with outdoor play structures, from slides and swings to see-saws and monkey bars. Some spaces are specially designed for younger children (with smaller slides, shorter ladders) and some for older children. Specially the Train ride is great for the kids as well as the adults! The location is heart of the town. My wife, daughter and I spent about two hours at the park. There is a very small fee to enjoy the park. Parking is available on the side streets. The scenery is beautiful and it is the perfect location for photographs. I truly recommend this park for children and as well as for adults.","July 28, 2020",0.0,0.0

Locals are free. We paid our fee to the lady behind the counter. As I turned around a male guard asked to check my ticket. He’d just seen me buy it but never mind. We saw signs stating no plastic bottles or bags were allowed as they become litter. The place was filthy with litter of all types but mostly plastic bottles. In one of the free flowing water areas there were several old tyres which had clearly been there for ages.  It was obvious the bottles were not all from the day before due to the condition or grubbiness  of them. We picked some up and gave them to one of the many guards and staff but there was too much for us to manage. No one appeared to be proactively litter picking when our perception was that a person could have been tasked with this. There was clearly ongoing work judging by the piles of garden debris but again our perception, this appeared to an effort to tidy the place up when it had been neglected over time. We noticed some of the plants were covered in graffiti scratched into their leaves. Some people eh! But then we saw what appeared to be locals rather than foreigners doing exactly that. Despite the wealth of staff and uniformed guards this behaviour was unchallenged so we did, loudly. These plants surrounded a water feature which was not in operation. There was a wooden jetty into the feature which looked 20 years past its prime, basically derelict and in need of removal. I know this is not main season so the gardens would not be at their best but the overall impression was of poor and overdue management. Overall we were disappointed and would not recommend this unless you have nothing else to do. So we left and walked up to the nearby lake which was even worse! Again we were asked to buy a ticket, from where we were we could see rubbish floating everywhere.  Don’t bother unless you want to see a few horses tethered. Nuwara Eliya is grossly overrated and was a shame to waste two booked nights there.","February 10, 2020",0.0,0.0

I’m somewhat surprised at the people who have quibbled over the payment of a fee of, little more than $1.50, after all this is what you would pay in tips for a piece of cake and a coffee in North America. So it’s worth putting the fee into perspective. It’s also worth putting into context the location of the park in Nuwara Eliya. Situated just next to the busy, cacophonous bus depot, it still manages to provide an amazingly tranquil experience. Granted the museum is a bit odd, and the cafe/eating area could do with greater imagination in terms of appeal, but the rest is heavenly. I would advise going at the very start of the day, you get to see the workers carefully tending the park’s flowers, and you hear sounds and see wonderful, characterful bird life. Just listening to the sounds was a tranquil experience. For such a small park, there’s a lot packed it, but it won’t appeal to those who just want to tick a box, to day they have visited the place, or who are too mean to part with a dollar. I was there for 3 hours, just resting and listening but, be aware, around lunchtime, it gets busy as (on the day I was there) crowds of children and tourists seemed to arrive in a short spell.","April 7, 2018",0.0,0.0

The rose garden was not as verdant as I remembered, though, which was rather sad, but given the vast expanse that has to be maintained, this was forgivable. I don't agree with people who don't want to pay to enter. This is a poor country and money is needed for maintaining attractions such as these.

There is a reasonably priced restaurant at the entrance with an adequate, if very limited menu, as well as a cafe inside the park serving drinks and snacks. Staff are friendly and helpful and the park was a welcome change from the frantic pace of the surrounding area.

We visited in February and it seemed some of the beauty had faded away in the winter months and some planting and gardening works were going on. I bet it looks much more beautiful in Spring and Summer. We still found it to be a lovely park for a pleasant stroll while also exploring some of its historic areas and trees. The playground had lots of fun rides and our daughter enjoyed them a lot. Like most places we visited in Sri Lanka, mornings and evenings seem to be the best times to visit the park.

This is a key wildlife area of open grassy woodland. Species found here include the leopard, sambar, and the endemic purple-faced langur. Endemic highland birds include the dull-blue flycatcher, Sri Lanka white-eye, and yellow-eared bulbul. The plains have a well-visited tourist attraction at World's End — a sheer precipice with a 1050 m drop. The return walk passes the scenic Baker's Falls. Early morning visits are best, both to see the wildlife and to view World's End before mists close in during the later part of the morning. One of the distinctive features of Nuwara Eliya's countryside is the widespread growing of vegetables, fruit and flowers usually associated with temperate Europe. This ""Little England"" is covered with terraces growing potatoes, carrots, leeks, and roses, interspersed with tea bushes on the steeper slopes. The slow-growing tea bushes of this highland region produce some of the world's finest orange pekoe tea.

Upon our arrival we were approached by Tony the Head Gardener who have us a whistle stop tour of the park, providing plant names and other interesting facts, referring often to his Kew Garden plant book.  Very interesting unplanned tour. A very peaceful place with families, couples and school parties all enjoying the space. I'd recommend a visit to these gardens.","April 10, 2016",0.0,0.0
