Insider tip for dizziness-free!,5,Solo,"A must have! Must see! But walk all the way up, not only the remains of the palace are worth seeing, but especially the view from the very top, where an old brick stupa still stands. But watch out for the numerous monkeys, they can get cheeky. The steps up to the palace are super steep and not for people who get dizzy quickly or who have trouble running, you really have to go up across, they are so narrow sometimes.

Today, Yapahuwa is a unique location of historic splendour, with its majestic rock carvings on either side of the stone stairway leading to what was the pavilion where the sacred tooth relic was kept.  I wore good walking shoes and carried a sun-hat.  We visited the site early morning to avoid the noon time heat and humidity.  There is no entry fee for locals and residents while the foreigners are charged a 4 USD (Rs. 620) fee. King Buwanekabahu who inherited the kingdom in 1272AD established his capital at Yapahuwa and built this rock fortress not only to defend the Sinhalese kingdom from the Indian Army garrisoned at Polonnaruwa but also for his own safety.  He also moved the Buddha’s sacred tooth relic and installed it in a building at the top of the rock to safeguard it from the enemy, for it was the belief that whoever had the tooth relic was the King.  However, after Buwanekabahu’s untimely demise in 1284, South Indians captured Yapahuwa and took away the tooth relic to India.  Thereafter Yapahuwa was largely abandoned but for some ascetic Buddhist monks.  To complete the history, the tooth relic was recovered later by his successor after negotiations with the Indian King and brought back to Sri Lanka. We entered the protected compound through the south gate after passing the ticket counter.  We went past the moat and a tall outer wall embankment in semi-circular pattern about 11 km long that encircled and safeguarded the city.  At the end of the semicircle is the steep Yapahuwa rock itself.  As I entered through the wide embankment of the fortress, I could not help being fascinated by the 100 metre tall rock that looms and abruptly rises above the surrounding plains.  We walked along neatly kept grounds for about 150 metres to the inner wall within which was the king’s palace and what would have been his council rooms for the war cabinet. The highlight of the visit was the sprawling, majestic and imposing stairway leading to the sanctum of the sacred tooth.  There are three flights of stairs.  The damaged lowest stairway had been restored with concrete steps while the upper two stairways are the originals, built of stone.  The first two staircases take you to a pavements of flat areas supported by retaining walls built of stone slabs.  The second staircase is not only steep at about 70 degrees but also narrow making you place your feet sideways - presumably to make it difficult for the enemy to get a foothold on during an attack.  Looking down from here I took a few photographs of the ruins of King Buwanekabahu’s palace, quite close to the bottom of the first staircase. The third stairway is awe inspiring in its beauty and breath-taking to look at.  The steps are wider too. Unlike the other two staircases both sides of this one are ornately carved with various figures – young girls holding a pot to welcome you, the head and trunk of elephant and the famed Yapahuwa Lion which appeared in one of the currency notes.  The sculpture displayed in these figures are amazing and spectacular. Crossing the doorway at the top of the staircase you enter the top plateau which again is supported by a retaining wall built of stone slabs.  Here I gazed at the ruins of the pavilion of the sacred tooth.  The columns in the doorway too are magnificently decorated.  The view of the surroundings from here, from so high up, is breath-taking, miles and miles of forest and fields in all directions! Turn left and follow the path to the top of the rock.  I went only half-way and did not attempt to climb this as it was far too steep for me.  On the way back we visited the adjoining temple too dating back to the 13th century and situated just outside the innermost wall of the city. It was a tiring climb but very informative, awe inspiring and educative.","February 26, 2018",0.0,0.0
