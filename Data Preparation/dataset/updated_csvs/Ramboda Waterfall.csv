So leaving Kandy we informed our driver that we had to see this as we left for Nuwara Eliya. The driver stopped by the main road and parked our tour car in the parking lot of the hotel. Clearly he had contacts, so he then got us a van that took us all the way down to the Ramboda Falls hotel. We walked through the hotel and got the lift down. You could see the falls on the way but then at the bottom as we got out of the lift we were able to walk down a narrow path and see and feel the full force of water falls. We were able to walk right to the edge of the falls and it was wonderful. The gushing water creating a mist and increasing the experience. The splash of the water and the noise was awesome. As always we saw the 'Instagramers' making fools of themselves taking risks in order to get their special shot. Absolutely crazy. Definitely worth a visit.","October 17, 2025",0.0,0.0

The short hike down to the waterfall is easy to manage, with clear paths surrounded by greenery and the calming sound of rushing water in the distance. The walk itself only takes a few minutes, but the view at the end is truly worth it—tall cascades of water surrounded by lush landscapes, creating a peaceful and refreshing atmosphere. It was also nice walking in the river to cross closer to the waterfall, but you have to be very careful because the water comes down very fast and can be dangerous. The water is incredibly fresh and cold, which made the experience even more memorable. You can also go to the top for a different perspective, and then down to the bottom for another view. Both give you beautiful and unique ways to appreciate the waterfall. Tip: Wear comfortable shoes, as the path can be a little slippery in some places, especially if it has rained. Overall, Ramboda Falls is a lovely, quick adventure that gives you a beautiful glimpse of Sri Lanka’s natural beauty without needing a long trek.","September 9, 2025",0.0,0.0

The center part of the waterfall is right next to the A5 main road a few 100 meters after passing Ramboda tunnel when you are coming from Kandy side. It's s small cascade and not much to look at when there is not much waterflow. The upper part of the waterfall can be viewed after climbing a flight of steps right next to the center part of the falls (on your left). You have to purchase a ticket for LKR 200. Lower part of the falls (and the most majestic) can be viewed by visiting the Ramboda falls hotel. The entrance to the hotel is to your right as soon as you come out of the Ramboda tunnel when coming from Kandy side. There is parking near the gate. From the gate of the hotel, there is a steep descent to the reception area, hence they provide a shuttle (van and a mini bus). Once you get to the reception (which is actually in the 4th floor) they will direct you to a lift which will take you to their restaurant. You can see the waterfall from there. You can also walk across the restaurant and walk about 100 meters and climb down a few steps to get to a viewing platform. [There was also a path to get to the bottom of the waterfall few meters below, but it was overgrown and we went in the rainy season, so didn't go to try that.] You have to pay LKR 100 to the hotel to see the waterfall and this includes the return shuttle service as well. A tuk driver from the area also told that there is a viewpoint accessible by tuk where you can see the top part of the waterfall but the road would not be accessible on the day we visited since it was raining heavily.","May 18, 2025",0.0,0.0

The room was one of the best, overlooking the waterfall. Although our room was large and had a balcony, I cannot recommend this hotel for an extended stay for discerning tourists or elderly Europeans and here's why. 1. The decoration of the room leaves a lot to be desired. Just bare white walls. 2. No bathrobe and slippers in the rooms. But, what is even worse - there is no air conditioning, there is only a fan. 3. There is no adapter (at least one) to Schuko and euro plug in the rooms. Good thing I brought one with me. 4. Breakfast was boring and incomplete. There were not even juices, which are offered even in 3*. Juices are on the menu for a fee. 5. To the hotel tourists are taken by minibus, as the descent and ascent there is very sharp. But I am not sure that it is for all tourists and free of charge. I must say that this hotel is probably the best option in Nuwara Elya area. I do not know. Probably for young tourists deciding to stay in the center of Sri Lanka for radial trips this is not a bad option either - there is a pool, wifi, safe, mini fridge and amazing views of the mountains and two waterfalls. As I wrote, the hotel is suitable for an overnight stay as an intermediate point.","May 14, 2025",0.0,0.0

A good time to visit! There's a parking area at the top of the paved driveway which leads to a hotel. Then take the elevator down and the trail from there to the falls. It is a bit of a walk, but you don't have to be in great physical shape to do it and it's all downhill. Coming back, it's about a five minute hike up the trail. Once you're in the hotel, you can get a shuttle van for only 100 rupees to take you back to your vehicle - well worth it! You'll pass several other waterfalls as you drive to Ramboda, as well as a large lake and several huge tea plantations.

Some of the reviews on here are not of the actual fall that most go to see. The beautiful one in the bulk of pictures is found by walking through the Ramboda Falls Hotel. GETTING THERE: You have to go all the way to the bottom of the stairs and then walk along a path.  It is not a 15-20 min hike. It's a walk down a street then down the stairs of a hotel, then along a path that is about 100-200 meters. It can be a bit taxing if you are not in great shape as it is still a lot of stairs.  Also, if you're walking down to the hotel from the road you might find it difficult. From the road, down the hotel stairs over to the falls, is a comfortable 15 minute walk.  There are restrooms in the hotel. I think there is also a lift that you can extra for.  The street down to the hotel is rather steep. THE FALLS: We saw 3 falls in Ramboda.  One was a quick one by the side of the road after the Rothschild tea farm.  Then this one. In the distance you can see a huge waterfall that is likely quite the hike for advanced folk. The one through the hotel, though is likely the one you want to see. On my insta, I'll be posting a video of some of the photo shots that are possible. When we were there, there were a few girls and guys that were clearly doing a photo shoot in front of the falls. I had envy. It's so beautiful and the set up for the shots is soo easy.  When we went it was not crowded, so we could do whatever we wished. TIME OF YEAR:  May is not quite wet and not quite dry season.  The images of people in the water must be during dry season. It would seem rather dangerous during May to go into the water.  The beauty of the falls is kind of independent of the weather season though, IMO. WHAT TO BRING/WEAR: Def bring your photo gear and anything you want for a photo.  Also, I would def wear shoes with good treads in the month of May. Despite a great walkway they've put up, you will end up with muddy shoe wear and it can feel a bit unsteady if you don't have any treads.","May 29, 2018",0.0,0.0

There are two options once you reach the top section of the hike - continue ascending and reach the 'hut' at the top (good for photography especially around 5.30 - 6.00pm during the sun set) or take the path down to the pool at the bottom of the fall.

The fortunate part means extra water over the waterfall and down the rapids. The unfortunate means photography is more difficult and keeping your camera dry. The 5-600 meter climb up to the main vantage point can be a bit taxing as it is steep and becomes slippery in the wet. If you are wearing sandals watch out for leeches they will get you. Reaching the sheltered viewing station allows for relative dry photography. With the tropical downpour the volume of water can double in a matter of minutes with an attendant rise in the sound as the water flings itself over the top ledge. I don't believe these are the highest falls in Srilanka at around 110 metres. Well worth the effort of climbing to the true waterfall.,"November 4, 2017",0.0,0.0

This hotel is ideally situated to get the best views of the Ramboda Water Fall. Our driver stopped the car on the main road. Many people find it difficult to walk down the steep winding alley to reach the hotel entrance which is far below the road level. The hotel is not even 50 metres from the road, but has a shuttle service to take people to the hotel and back. When we arrived at the hotel, the placed was packed with people. Several tour groups have arrived in buses and they were enjoying the buffet lunch. The hotel staff basically force you to have buffet lunch saying ordering food from the menu can take a long time. We reluctantly took the option of going for the Buffet lunch and found the food to be very ordinary. There were too many people and the food was not being replenished fast enough. We found some of the visitors scraping the bottom of the containers unable to find enough food in them. We found an empty table in a far corner and kept our camera and the handbag on the table to show the table is occupied. We asked for a ginger beer. They have run out of ginger beer and we had to manage with only a bottle of water. We served our food and brought the plate back to the table to find another person sitting at our table in spite of our handbag and the camera. We were not sure how to handle it and luckily for us, the waiter came and asked the person to move to another table. He was a single person on his own. We heard the person arguing with the waiter saying he was occupying the table before we came and they cleared it before he finished eating. Anyway, he has finished eating his desert and left the table without a fuss. I was feeling a bit awkward, but these things can easily happen when the restaurants are over crowded. My advice is that all the people should not leave the table at the same time. You leave at least one person at the table when you go to serve your food. I took a few photos of the water fall from the back yard of the hotel. A few years ago, it was possible to walk right up to the water fall. Now they have put a fence preventing the people getting too close to the water fall. We left the place a bit shaken, but this is one place you should visit when you are on your way to Nuwara Eliya. I am not happy with the quality of the food and my advice is to avoid staying overnight unless you are a keen nature lover and like to explore the area. If possible, avoid the big crowd by not going there during the lunch time. A soft drink or a beer with a side plate like chips or sandwiches is better than their lunch. In any case, you cannot avoid paying extra money for the food, just to have a good look at the water fall and the beautiful scenery around the area.","March 2, 2016",0.0,0.0

The experience started with a shuttle drive to the hotel.

From the hotel, there is a set of gentle stairs which presumably provide a very easy stroll down to the waterfall in a good weather, but become a waterfall of their own under a heavy rain. Ramboda waterfall itself is quite big, though not particularly picturesque.

What is interesting is the small scale hydro electric infrastructure that is set up to power local industry including the Glenloch tea factory we visited (part powered by wood fires too). What is great about the drive in is the many food vendors - we had coconut rotis with palm syrup at a local tea cafe (below the white Rothschild sign set against a cliff face) and ate local fruits sold by various vendors, including durian (a fruit that looks like a sleeping larvae incased in a gigantic oval chestnut, reeking of fermenting garbage ...

It is at Ramboda town, one encounters this beautiful Ramboda Falls, which gushes out a broad cascade of water, a sight to behold. Nice place for pictures!","April 11, 2013",0.0,0.0
