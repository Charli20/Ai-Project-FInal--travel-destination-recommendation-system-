In folklore, Thotupola, as the literal name suggests is said to be the place where this this machine was parked. Thotupola is the third highest mountain in Sri Lanka and the hike to it's summit is the easiest  out of the trails in the Horton Plains Forest Reserve. You will come to the trail entrance a couple of hundred meters after you pass the Pattipola entrance and move towards the famous Horton plains trail entrance. There is a sign board indicating the place. It's a 2 km (one way) relatively easy hike with very little elevation gain. The round trip including photo stops took us 2 hours. But then again, my legs were feeling like jelly after a more strenuous hike the day before, so we pretty much moved at the pace of sloths. There is a clear path right to the top. But in certain places the path can get very narrow, sandwiched between thick shrub jungle on both sides. So it's advisable to be fully covered to avoid being scratched from tree branches. A hiking stick would also be useful to pave the way when the shrubs become too thick. The vegetation is quite different from the Horton plains trail. Here you mostly walk through a scrub jungle (a plus on a sunny day though) and there are only couple of open areas where you would get a nice view of the surrounding areas. The day we visited, there was a heavy mist, so even the open areas didn't offer much of a view. The supposed summit (assuming what we thought as the summit was the actual summit) is a bit of an anti climax being marked by a telecommunications tower and covered in shrub jungle, hence offering no views. Its better to remember that the highlight of this trail is the journey and not the end destination.... On the subject of lepords...... Post corona, Horton Plains had had increased sightings of leopards. At the Pattipola entrance ticket counter, we were told not to get down from the vehicle until we got to the Horton plains trail car park which is 5kms away, due to the presence of leopards. However when we told them that we would be taking the Thotupola trail which would basically require us to get down from the vehicle on the path between the ticket counter and the main car park they said that was perfectly fine....! At the entrance to the Thotupola trail there was another sign warning about the presence of leopards. We were a little apprehensive at first since there were only 2 of us. But another group of 4 boys joined us at the trail. Plus it was a long weekend and the route to the main Horton plains trail was quite busy with vehicular traffic.  So, our advice would be to either go with a large group or in a really busy period. There is not much parking space at the entrance to this trail, but you can generally manage to park there since not many people take this trail. [While the ticket office will tell you to park only at the main car park, those who take this trail will be allowed to park at its entrance.] Surprisingly, there were also two newly built, very clean washrooms at the entrance to the trail. The park opens at 6 am but there are separate closing times for each trail. Do check those before visiting. I love any and every kind of hike and loved this hike as much as any other one I have taken. Also loved the misty weather even if it meant no stunning views. But objectively, this hike is neither as adventurous as the Kirigalpotta hike nor as picturesque as the horton plains trail (all in the same Forest Reserve), hence the four star rating.","August 20, 2024",0.0,0.0

We made the mistake of getting there later (mid day) and it was all misty. Though the forest trail was very enjoyable when we were heading to the top it was very windy and covered in mist ( we enjoyed it nevertheless) I would not encourage toddlers / children under the age of 10 as the way to the top will have grass reaching your waist or taller. do not wear shorts, you may bruise yourself. wear long thicker trousers. Due to the time we got to the top we could view anything. but the treck itself was very enjoyable. if you take a small snack with you, there are small patches where you can lie down and enjoy. in the event you do decide to take children under the age of 10, its best for an adult to scope when you arrive at the narrow route with tall glades and then decide if the children could make it through. If the kids are well seasoned travel enthusiasts, they will enjoy the trail further uphill. You can always turn back if the going gets tough!","August 28, 2018",0.0,0.0
