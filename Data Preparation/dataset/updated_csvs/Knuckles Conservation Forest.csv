Knuckles Deanstone is a best place to enjoy the beauty of this forest reserve. There are established forest tracks at Deanstone: One goes to Dothalugala  observation point and other one leads to Mini World's End. Dothalugala observation point trek is a moderate strenuous trek. We got a ticket from Deanstone forest office and entered the forest path. As usual the path is infested with leeches but we applied ALUM on shoes.  Weather in Knuckles is unpredictable. The mist was around when we reached Dothalugala Observation Point. You don't need a guide in trekking to Dothalugala trail. Deanstone Mini World's end is situated other side of the road and it also need entrance ticket. This is fairly flat terrain compared to Dothalugala trail. The Mini World's end trail is a circular trail and you will come across two view points. Deanstone forest office has different accommodation options but need to book in advance.","November 10, 2021",0.0,0.0

Better to bring a vehicle with good ground clearance. 2 Bedrooms with washrooms and a hall with a care taker and a cook. We can book the facility only for the consecutive 3 days. There are several attractions. Mini world's end is beautiful place with breathtaking panoramic views, specially the views of east Sri Lanka . Just 1.5Km form the bungalow. Better to avoid July to August season because of the heavy wind in this area. It is very risky to visit Mini world end and other attractions during windy season. As it gives panoramic view of the east Sri Lanka, best place to watch sun rise. Dothalugala Nature trail and Birds Deck are some other attractions which are very near to the bungalow. It was about 12Km trail which brought us through a peak of a Dothalugala. Trail become very misty when it goes up and up. Went to the Birds Deck with lot of hopes.

Then I must thank my dear guide-tracker-friend namely Daya for all the guidance, support and hospitality bestowed during my stay in Sri Lanka. The Knuckles Mountain Range covers parts of Kandy and Matale districts and is separated from the Central Hills by the Mahaveli Valley to the South and East and the Matale Valley to the West. Its name derived from its shape of a clenched fist, which forms a scenic wonderland. What makes the Knuckles Forest/Mountain Range unique is the geographical character of its location. Perpendicular to the mountain range that runs from Laggala to Urugala runs three distinct but lesser ranges while there are other minor ranges running parallel to it. There are a total of 34 clearly identified such ranges with in the 62 square miles that makes up 3000-6500feet in height. Knuckles Mountain Range is important due to the historical value it carries and therefore it can be categorized as one of the valuable heritages in Sri Lanka. The story of Knuckles (Dumbara Hill) goes back into prehistoric periods. It is said that in ancient times it was referred to as ‘Giri Divaina’ and as ‘Malaya Rata’ and there is archaeological evidence that speaks of ancient Yaksha settlement in the area. People believe that the name ‘Lanka’ is derived which much folklore has gathered over the centuries. The Knuckles Mountain Range is an invariable referent in any salutary appreciation of the last kingdom of the Sinhala Kanda Udarata. The importance of the Knuckles Mountain Range is obtained from several factors. It has a parasitical quality to it because of the mountain peaks, the crystal clear and perennial waterways, cloud forests and exquisite fauna and flora. Pregnant with history running into several millennia and a veritable treasure house of cultural heritage, the Knuckles Mountain Range can be considered a as a mirror to the past. A remarkable feature of this area is that most of the climatic conditions of Sri Lanka can be found with in the extent of a mountain range. All these hanging climatic conditions can be experienced within half and hour walk through this valley. The location of the hills, the particular effect of the monsoons and the wind factor generate a certain climatic diversity to the area. In fact in these hills one can find characteristics of all the key ecological zones found in the country. Average annual rainfall lies between 3000-5000ml, and temperature of the region ranges between 5.5 degrees and 35 degrees Celsius. It is through a gap in the mountain that the winds of Southwest Monsoon enter to the Dry Zone. The average wind speed has been measured to be approximately 7.2km/hour and humidity in the range lies between 57%-90%.

The average wind speed has been measured to be approximately 7.2km/hour and humidity in the range lies between 57%-90%. Water Resources Since the main risen in opposition to both the Southwest and Northwest Monsoons, the area enjoys bountiful rainfalls. For this and other reasons, the Knuckles Mountain Range is counted among the richer of the upper watersheds in the country. In fact from these hills flow the richer of the tributaries to the Mahaweli River. There are three main rivers called the Hulu Ganga, the Heen Ganga and the Kalu Ganga, which begin from Knuckles Mountain Range. And there are a number of breathtaking waterfalls and small rivers, which can be found in this area. Even to day as was in the ancient days water from Knuckles Mountain Range feeds the ancient irrigation works such as Parakrama Samudraya. The villagers together with about more than 2500 years old indigenous community of Knuckles Mountain Range form a unique bio–cultural landscape. Meemure, Kaikawala, and Galamuduna are few villages out of 37, which can be found in this area. Indigenous community in this area has always interacted with and depended upon the Knuckles Frosts and this association goes as for back as times. The day-to-day lifestyle of this community are very simple and their main income generating sources are farming, cultivation of Paddy, and Hena, and Cardamom. These villagers relay on cattle for transporting good between villages and sub-urban areas and this is referred as Pack Ox (Thawalam). The traditional villagers in this area maintain the rich cultural diversity associated with unique natural landscape of Knuckles. The cultural heritage which has been passed down through generations have been well preserves in these remote villages and being isolated from the rest of the world is one of the main reasons for this. Educational Value The Knuckles Mountain Range is an ideal natural laboratory for the study of biodiversity, ecological zones, natural processes, botany and biology. Also it plays a key role in the study/research areas such as history, archeology, indigenous community and their. Vegetation Types Basically there are 5 vegetation types Semi Evergreen Forests Sub Montage Forest Montage Forest Patana and Savanna Grasslands Riverine Forests Semi Evergreen Forests These types of forests cam be seen in the lower elevation (below 700m) in the Knuckles Mountain Range. These forests harbor many large trees for an example, phyllanthis indica, crateara religiosa, sterculia foetida, bombex can be given. The trees in these types of forests shed their leaves during the dry and windy seasons, in July-August and therefore the animal diversity in this area is very high and different kinds of birds and insects can be seen thought out the whole year. The other important aspects about this type of vegetation are that they function as excellent catchments of river Mahaveli. They are effective in blocking or intercepting rain with little or no soil erosion and sustain streams, which plays a key role in sustaining of downstream ecosystem. Sub Montane Forest A transitional biological beet between highlands and lowlands is clearly visible in this area. This vegetation type is threatened due to the Cardamom cultivation expansion of tea and human activities. This vegetation type mostly experiences the dry wind during the year, especially during the period of May-August and this forest type also plays a key role as primary catchments and watershed area. his vegetation type can be seen above 1300m in Knuckles Range and can be seen areas such as Thangappuwa, Kalupahana and Gombaniya During the year heavy mist can be seen in these types of forests. Montane forests are the most important catchments and water shed areas of the Knuckles Range. It plays a key role in providing a water supply to sustain the ecosystems and livelihoods through the year in the downstream areas. These types of the forests contribute a lot when it comes to the natural beauty in Knuckles Mountain Range. Patana and Savanna Grasslands The man created fires due to the ""Hena"" cultivation courses in Knuckles Region turn into savanna vegetation types. Threes, which are adapted to fire, can be seen in these forests. Savanna vegetation types can be seen only on hill slopes below corbel’s gap area and this vegetation type has a very basic and simple structure. Also isolated trees which have about 10m height scattered over vast expanse of grasslands can be seen. Patana This vegetation type can be seen in hills below 1000m. This vegetation type occurs due to various human activities such as agricultural expansion due to tea and chena cultivation, fire and removal of timber species. ‘Pitawala Patane’ is a unique creation of the environment and can be seen by the side of Rattota, Illukkumbura in Central Province of Sri Lanka. Pitawala Patana is the grazing land of large number of buffaloes and cattle owned by villagers in the vicinity. Riverine Forests These types of forests can be seen along the banks of streams such as Kaluganga and Heenganga in Knuckles Mountain Range. The advantage of these forests are they act like frontline defense against stream bank erosion due to water current and provide convenient resting sites for animals in Knuckles Mountain Range. Flora Knuckles holds a wide variety of Fauna. Most importantly it is a home to many endangered and endemic species. 247 vertebrate species have been recorded in this area which 26% are endemic to Sri Lanka, including 14 birds and 9 fish species. More than a 100 of other resident and migrant bird species can been observed at deferent times of the year. Five of these endemic species, three fresh water fish phillipis gara-garra phillipsi, martenstyne’s puntius srilankensis) one amphibian (marbled cliff frog-nannophrys mamorata) and one lizard (ceretophora tennenti) are restricted to knuckles forest range. Further, Knuckles Mountain Range is home to most of the mammals found in Sri Lanka. In addition to elephants, leopards and sambhurs there are also wild boar, spotted deer, barking deer, mouse deer, and giant squirrel etc. etc. Fauna In Knuckles Mountain Range a total of 1033 flowering plants, belonging to 141 In Knuckles Mountain Range a total of 1033 flowering plants, belonging to 141 Of the total number of flowering plants species documents in Knuckles, 160 are endemic to Sri Lanka while, about 32% are nationally threatened.

The Dumbara mountain range consists over 35 mountains and the knuckles is a range with 5 unique mountains. Approach to forestation and the range of mountains have many routes. Traveling from Colombo via Kandy, Matale and Rattota and through  Bambaralla , via Wattegama , you can view the blue hills of Dumbara range of mountains at a distance over the horizon. Also this remarkable range of mountains can be observed fro he lower range of plains of Matale, Dambulla  and the hills of Badulla. Access: From Colombo through Kandy, Matale Rattota and Illikkumbura ir  tajing a route from Colombo through Galeweka, Navyka pallegana, illikkumbura , both take 5 hours each. Through Kandy, Teldeniya, Bambarekka  and  through Ragala, Thangappuwa Kobert pass, Lullwatta, Deenstan , each route take about 6 hours or little more , depending on traffic  and weather changes. Two more routes to reach Dumbara forest are through Hunnasgiriya, Lullwatta and Kobert pass, Kaikawala , Meemure. The total area is approximately 52500 acres or about 180 square kilometers. The geographical coordinates are 7deg27’ -8 deg-8’ and 80deg-40’ 82deg east. T he heaviest rain fall to the mountain range is during October to February, making all streams and waterfalls rich with water. However this period is not suitable to tour the forestation due to bad weather conditions. The average rainfall to the higher range of mountains is around 5000mm where the lower plains are a bit dry. The highest peak out of the hills is “Gombania” which peaks at 1900metrs, while there are nearly 35 hills over 900meters. The name “Knuckles” had been given to the five mountains, Kirigalpotta, Gombania,Knuckles, Koboneelagala and Dotalugala by the Englishmen as it looked like the knuckles of a fist. The range of mountains has an extremely sensitive environmental   habitat where the environmentalists has identified it as a separate isle due to the fact that it is separated from other mountain ranges , which’s in the deep “Mahaweli” basin. 4 main origin feeder water ways to rivers start across the Luggala range of hills. They are the water feed of Kalu ganga, Heen ganga,  Kulu ganga ad Sudu ganga rivers. The original feeder of AMban ganga river also commence and flow beautifully through rocky terrain of Meemure. Glboda oya and Theligamu oya are another two beautiful water ways which creates water falls on their way down. The forestation in the range is rich with endemic birds, butterflies, lizards, fishes and other creatures. Some of the interesting places in the Dumbara range are Riverstan  ( Kirimatiyana range of hills) , Pitawala thenna plains(the second largest plain in the island) and its s precipitous “small world’s end” Theligamu oya with its natural water pool,  in Illukkumbura, Manigala hill which is ideal for trekkers, Luggala rang of hills, Kobert pass and Deenstan  precipices. If you are a lover of waterfalls, few beautiful water falls in the range are Sera elle falls, Bambarakiri ella falls, Raninda falls, Wdda pani ella falls, Dumbara duwili ella, Mengoda dola ella, Ratna ella, Rahas ella , Hulu ganga diya ella, Thaliya watuna ella and Lebonon estate water falls. However, to reach some of these waterfalls you need to trek through the forestation In the event tourists need to stay  overnight some of the places are Sir John’s bungalow in Riverstan, Circuit bungalows belonging to forest department and few private guest houses. The best time for tourists to commence their tour is between 7 t 8 am. You should be cautious and prepared to face rapid weather changes, rain, heavy blowing and bad weather. It’s advisable to be ready for leaches if trekking. It is not advisable to trek alone. Instead it would be better to obtain the assistance of a guide through the Forest department. Also carrying  fresh water , snacks and some cloths for a change would be advisable for trekkers . Wearing light colour cloths will be an advantage through forestation.

Although most of the treks are very difficult, anyone can capture many picturesque locations. We traveled to see some abandoned and rural villages close to Knuckles conservation forest. Those are the most beautiful villages I have ever been in my life. Also we were able to see hundreds of mini water falls during our trekking through the thick forest. EcoAdventureSriLanka is the best tour operator to arrange a Knuckles expedition.","September 5, 2013",0.0,0.0

It was an experience which speaks for ever. We booked a camping site and everything was arranged for us. We did not have any kind of luxury but the lesson and experience gained worth more than anything. One Mr. Wasantha local villager who arranged the camp site and food for us at his house. Very nice guy and very helpful. The villagers are very kind and they helped us a lot. The beauty of them is they don't do this for money. They welcome and treat you like one of them. The majority of the villagers are farmers and coming from a poor background but they're rich in sharing they're food with us. The place is heavy wind and in the night we felt like the tents will go off. Beautiful surrounding and safe river bath. planning to go again since I miss that place.","May 6, 2013",0.0,0.0

It is a 100 year old planter's bungalow with 5 bedrooms and attached toilets. The mist is so thick and it literally gets swept into the room with the wind. On the 2nd day we went on a 16Km trek to Manigala. It took us 6 hours, but well worth the effort and pains after. Remember to wear water proof shoes or slippers which would keep your feet dry. Take a bottle of lime/ antiseptic or balm to keep the leeches away. Wear light cotton clothes and take a rain coat with you, and a bottle of water. On the 2nd day we visited Sera Ella, where you can walk to the back of the waterfall.  Unless you have a vehicle with high road clearance, you would need to park approx 2Kms away and walk to the falls. Pitawala Pathana and Worlds end is on the way to Laggala. But due to the rainy/ misty weather (and the leeches) we did not get down. There is also an easy trail up to the VHF tower where on a clear day the view is supposedly good. The highlight of the trip was the trail to Manigala through the terraced paddy fields and a remote village called Etanwala where there are only 40 families. One of us lost a slipper while wading through a stream and we got a worn pair from a villager who refused to take any kind of payment! The views on top of Manigala is amazing. Take a tracker to avoid getting lost or shooing the rare wild buffaloes on the path!","February 12, 2012",0.0,0.0
