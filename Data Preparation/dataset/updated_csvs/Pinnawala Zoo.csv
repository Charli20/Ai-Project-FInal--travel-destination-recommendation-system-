They only have a select # of type of animals. The main attractions are the leopards, the sloth bears & the crocodiles enclosures. Other than that they have a petting/feeding station for kids with goats, chickens, ducks, geese, swans. What I really liked about the place is that the animals have lots of roaming space. They're not in cages, but have enclosures. Some people have commented that the Dehiwala zoo is better, but I personally feel that place is a hell for animals & these people have no idea what they're saying. Innocent animals in cages without any space. Here on the other hand, they've tried to copy the natural habitat that they live in & none of the animals are alone. They also have a lot of information about the animals for visitors. You can read a lot about their habits, history, mating, eating habits etc. They're also constructing more enclosures for more animals. This is how a zoo should be like. Much more space & bit more freedom for the animals. Foreigners who buy tickets to this place also get free access to the Pinnawala elephant orphanage & vice versa.

It brought me to tears and all the guards would say is that he is mad. Who wouldn’t go mad being tied up like that, he couldn’t even move?! The rest weren’t seemingly chained, although they do chain the males when taking them for bathing. The conditions were cramped for nearly 100 elephants and bathing time is supervised - they cannot go to bathe in their own time and are restricted in how long they can spend there, not to mention it is right in front of a hotel where everyone gets to stare. I am concerned this is simply a tourist attraction as people can pay to feed the baby elephants and keepers were riding them as well as using hooked sticks to move them along. Of course I don’t know what conditions they were ‘rescued’ from though I am not convinced these elephants looked particularly happy. This is very heartbreaking, not at all what I was expecting and I left very upset. It’s difficult to recall any fond memory of this experience as all I can imagine is the pain of that chained elephant.","May 8, 2018",0.0,0.0

Anyway we were happy we opted for the buggy because of the guide (who has been zoo staff member from the Dehiwala zoo with a lot of experience). The highlight we thought was the Leopard Enclosure. There are 4 leopards. Leopords are territorial animals thus you can not have 2 males in one enclosure. There are 2 enclosures with one spanning 1 acre of land so sometimes you might find it hard to spot it. Two were in the adjoining cage (Mother and cub). There are Mules, Bears, Crocodiles / Alligators, different varieties of Deer  (including one which is non vegetarian) well yes not so many as we dont have that many wild beasts in LK. Special Note: Do not Operate Cameras with Flash. Seems flash could damage eyes of animals. Our guide was really angry whenever he saw people using flash.

The bear was hiding in the cage and only came out when the  workers called the fellow out.
