Smooth motoring to the monkeys which I suspect have been transported here to give tourists something to ooh and aaah at. They were well fed and appeared happy even though out of their natural habitat. we also set up camp in the shallows of an island for some fruit eating. A worthwhile experience for 90 mins (no longer) and if you aren't too concerned about the contrived well trodden process which a couple of boat operators conduct. I thik our company was St Mary's tours. The pollution of the mangroves with plastic and other rubbish is concerning.","April 22, 2019",0.0,0.0

Have had some bad experiences in the past but was persuaded into it as it is a lagoon and was told that it would be smooth sailing.  So glad I risked it as it was fantastic to sail along the canal - so much to see.  Great to see the fish market from the water side and then to sail on into the lagoon.  Plenty of wildlife to see and so quiet - like another world.  We saw bats in the trees and made a stop at monkey island to give the monkeys left over fruit and water to drink.  A lovely trip out - well worth the small amount it cost.,"March 25, 2019",0.0,0.0

Walk and wonder at the many thousands of salted and split fish (Tunidae) laid out on great long mats and drying in the sun.  Ignore the strong fishy smell and the scores of persistent Asian Crows, and stroll on along to the covered open-air fish market where deeper-sea fish like the delicious Butterfish or Sunfish amongst many others, are being sold and cleaned. Mounds of glistening prawns, Blue Crabs, Rock Lobsters, enough to make a Billingsgate market man gasp. One word of warning, you WILL be approached by what appear to be local beach bums offering to guide you.  They tend to be ""on the beach"" fishermen who go no more to sea because of ill-health or injury.  They usually speak good English and I was fortunate in that the 500 Sri Lankan Rupees (approx. 5 pounds Sterling at that time) demanded was very well earned.  So, when approached, my advice is, negociate a price beforehand, and pay after, and if the would-be guide is not to your liking for whatever reason, politely turn him down, but please, always politely with smile of thanks.. That is valid advice for any of the very many worthwhile sights in Sri Lanka","December 11, 2018",0.0,0.0

Several companies offer boat tours on the lagoon which is an estuarine lagoon. You will see many different types of birds and the fishermen at work. Also if you walk to where the inlets are located, near the fish market and on the nearby islands of Doowa and Mankuliya you will see hundreds of small fishing boats with the locals busy at work. This was one of my great experiences during my stay in Negombo. Another interesting fact is that the whole lagoon is no deeper than one meter.","April 7, 2018",0.0,0.0
