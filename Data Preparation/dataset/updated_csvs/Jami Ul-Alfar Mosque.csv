You have a wait a bit to go in.  Some guy ""shows"" you around but in actual fact he does absolutely nothing and just takes you to the balconies on the upper floor.  It was a complete waste of time and a waste of money as he will force you to tip him for literally doing nothing. Stay on the ground floor and get your photos and leave.  It's a working mosque so people are praying and there are people all around you trying to honour their religion so not sure how much they appreciate the tourists coming to visit. Worth a very brief trip but don't expect to be marvelled.","December 21, 2025",0.0,0.0

Built in 1908, this historic mosque stands out with its vibrant red and white candy-striped façade, a style that makes it instantly eye-catching and unique. The building’s intricate design and towering minarets are truly fascinating, and the peaceful interior offers a quiet contrast to the bustling Pettah streets outside. Visitors are welcome to explore parts of the mosque respectfully, it’s spacious and beautifully maintained. It’s best to walk or take a taxi, as parking nearby can be difficult due to the narrow streets. You will also find many other local attractions and markets just steps away, making it a great stop during a city walk. A must viait spot for anyone exploring Colombo’s heritage and vibrant culture. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐","November 6, 2025",0.0,0.0

This, to me, only made it all the more compelling. Don’t worry if you’re trying to track this discovery down, the Red Mosque is located right smack in the middle of Second Cross Street that’s in the hectic Pettah Market district, and is extremely easy to find even when you’re not looking.

Most mosques in the world are not constructed with the same architectural design template. Singapore boasts of her magnificent Indo-Saracenic Masjid Sultan Mosque in Kampong Glam endowed with a golden dome. The unique Chinese style Sultan Ismail Petra Silver Jubilee Mosque (Beijing Mosque) in Kelantan (Malaysia) uniquely  combined Islamic architectural design with Chinese architecture. The Sultan Abu Bakar Mosque across the Johor Causeway has her attractiveness in her Victorian architecture. The magnificent and stunningly beautiful Omar Ali Saiffuddien Mosque and Jame' Asr Hassanal Bolkiah Mosque in Brunei mesmerized me with her grand and stylish Islamic architecture. Most of these mosques are located in serene and peaceful setting. I was amazed to see this red mosque within the precinct of the most chaotic and rowdy Pettah market of Colombo. When I came from the airport and alighted from the bus 187, I was confronted with a bazaar that was rowdy, crowded and noisy. It took me sometime to manoeuvre my way through the busy streets and eventually located this mosque. Nonetheless, the candy red white coloured of her façade made her distinctly different from the surrounding and stands out from the rest of the buildings. You can also combine your visit to the mosque with visits to other nearby attractions. Beside the Pettah market, there is an old town hall, a Hindu temple, a church and a clock tower that were built during the colonial period. When I was in Kandy, I also visited the red mosque over there but I still found this one in Pettah market a more impressive one. . Colombo may boast of her colonial building built during the British Empire days but this unique mosque is a must visit if you are in Colombo.","April 5, 2019",0.0,0.0

Those who can also read Arabic script might get confused over Masjid's name as in Arabic it's written Al-Jami Al-Azfar. The original Masjid name might have got lost in the local translation, but not the grandeur and splendor it still holds. 🌺🌺 Al-Azfar mosque was built in 1908 by the spices trading Arab businessmen who frequented Colombo port. It's considered one of the oldest Masjids in Colombo, and said to accommodate more than 10k devotees at one time. Indeed it's a colorful, unique, and marvelous architecture with an exterior of red & white brick pattern. The interior walls and ceiling are painted with white, golden, and green color, but the praying mats are patterned with exterior; red & white. Over the period of time the Masjid has grown, without changing its architectural pattern, into a 6+ floors monument. It's a huge building complex and one can easily get lost if one forgets the way one came in by. The absence of any direction signs doesn't help much to the lost soul either.🌹🌹🌹 As you entered the Pettah street from any direction you won't miss this Masjid, which appears as if a well decorated King standing among his ragtag subjects. Step outside the tranquility of Masjid and you will see street littered with shops, sidewalk stalls, and pushcarts selling merchandise including food, fruits, fabric, and female accoutrements. A paradise for those who indulge in bargaining, and a headache for those who prefer to go by fixed price tags.🌼🌼 While women's access is restricted to outer courtyard, men (non-Muslims) are welcomed to visit every yard of Masjid, and provided wrap if they are wearing shorts. Have seen many tourists visiting the Masjid and was quite pleased to see caretakers of Masjid welcoming non-Muslims (male) into the Masjid and answering their questions patiently.🌷💐 Good to see Sri Lankans (Buddhists, Christians, Muslims) gelling well together as a nation with harmony, tolerance and mutual respect for each others faith. I returned from Sri Lanka with more respect and admiration for the people of Sri Lanka and the friendly attitude they show towards all.🌸🌸 Thumbs Up👍👍","August 27, 2017",0.0,0.0

I also went inside the building itself and up a few levels, and was quite impressed by spacious areas with shiny marble floors & stairways although it was quite ""bare"" inside. By public transportation, the best way to get here is to take the bus to Colombo Fort which is Colombo's ""main station"" for both trains & buses (trains inside and buses outside; you can find here trains to popular tourists spots outside Colombo like those to Galle for going to the Galle Fort and those to Habarana for going to the Sigiriya Lion Rock, and also buses to various destinations both inside & outside Colombo including the Airport which is about two hours away from the city). From Colombo Fort, it's just about a ten-minute walk to the Mosque (first turn right to head east after crossing the road in front of the Station or just go straight ahead if you get off the bus on the other side of the road, then turn left into the street called '2nd Cross' after about five minutes, and the Mosque will be on your right just after about five more minutes along that crowded ""market street"" heading north). Afterward, you might also want to check out the Clock Tower just about a five-minute walk to the west from the Mosque (turn right into the first street, which is also another market street, and it will be pretty much right in front of you when you get to the roundabout at the end of the street); further west (about 15 to 20 minutes from the Clock Tower), there's a ""charming"" part of the city to walk around among nice well-maintained ""colonial buildings"" all the way to the Lighthouse.","January 25, 2016",0.0,0.0
