This could be a stunning example of 17th Century Dutch V.O.C  military architecture , The stone battlements, and buildings withing the Fort are lovely.The tunnel leading out of the Fort is closed- what a pity. Would love to see it again after some loving care - and some serious money= was spent on it.","June 14, 2015",0.0,0.0

Admired from a historical point of view, the fortress walls and guard rooms and the remnants of the buildings that would have been used as barracks to house the invading Dutch soldiers about 3 centuries ago. Some of the buildings are still used by the navy to house sailors and to store goods. Managed to walk around the encampment with a navy guide who was very helpful. A rare site was the entrance to an underground tunnel which would have been used as an escape route in the event of a siege in the olden days. Couldn't help wondering how an attack would have subdued the Dutch garrison which would have been in station couple of centuries ago with the amount of defensive measures built in to the fort. Excellent place for a military historian to study stratregies of war of a bygone era.","September 21, 2014",0.0,0.0

We need to take permission from Navy prior visit the place. It is the current navy base of Kalpitiya. SL Navy gave us a warm welcome and gave a tour of the fortress. And then they gave us a boat trip around the Kalpitiya area too. Don't forget this area is really hot. and not developed yet. So dont expect food cities and luxurious shops here.","May 16, 2014",0.0,0.0

But it is motorable in a car. The Navy Base is within the Fort and I assume prior approval is required to visit. I called the base and spoke to a gentleman who was more than willing to show us around and even gave us refreshments! It is a small fort and is not in good shape. It was built in 1667 on the spot where the Portuguese had a stockade and a Jesuit chapel, now the chapel is in ruins. There are also remnants of a commander's house, barrack rooms, a prison and several go downs. We were shown 2 secret passages which lead to the exterior of the ramparts. A few meters outside the Fort is the Old Dutch Church which is not in use. The only objects within is a heavy stone fountain, a few inscribed gravestones inside the church and the old belfry.","March 25, 2013",0.0,0.0
