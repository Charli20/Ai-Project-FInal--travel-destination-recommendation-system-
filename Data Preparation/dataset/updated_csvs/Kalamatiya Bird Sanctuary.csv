I had corresponded with Gayan, the owner, beforehand and his communication was timely and informative. On our arrival, we were met by our guide, Pasindu, who welcomed us and helped us onto the catamaran ably captained by Sanjeewa.  Once aboard, Pasindu gave us both a pair of binoculars and explained about the sanctuary and the lagoon. We set off and, thanks to Sanjeewa’s smooth navigation, spent a wonderfully relaxing two and a half hours travelling at a leisurely pace around the lagoon and through the mangroves. Pasindu pointed out not only numerous birds - including different types of kingfisher, storks, egrets, whistling ducks, ibis and Brahminy kites - but also macaques, water buffalo and flora. Our highlight was seeing a trio of hornbills. About halfway through our tour, we stopped to climb a rock to a viewpoint and sat for a while to admire the beauty and tranquility of the area whilst continuing our conversation with Pasindu about the local wildlife.  Once back on the catamaran, Pasindu gave us water, bananas and some savoury snacks that had been made by Gayan’s mother. We would thoroughly recommend this trip to both bird watchers and people who enjoy a peaceful boat ride in a beautiful setting.","August 8, 2025",0.0,0.0

Our boatman came and met us at the hotel at 6:30 am and it was only a five minute walk to the lakeside. We were blessed with a beautiful bright calm tranquil morning. It was a fabulous way to spend a couple of hours, with just the sound of the water as our boat was being expertly punted through the lagoon, including heavily weeded areas. There were a couple of other boats on the water too but the reserve is large enough that we were on our own for 95% of the time. Our guide was extremely knowledgeable in knowing where the best locations were to see birds and he could identify them easily for us. He was also well prepared with binoculars and the Birds of Sri Lanka Guide book, as well as water and fruit for breakfast. Now my wife and I don't confess to be ""twitchers"" but we really enjoyed the experience, and counted 33 different species, including eight completely new ones to us. We also saw some black faced monkeys (grey langurs), and most memorable - a newly born water buffalo calf, so young it couldn't yet stand up, and our guide felt it was under 2 hours old. So...we Highly highly recommend Kalamatiya Bird Sanctuary with the guided boat trip.  You don't need to know anything about birds to take pleasure in the reserve, and if you venture out early like we did you'll still be back in time for breakfast. .","March 23, 2019",0.0,0.0

He quickly arranged for his father to punt us out on the lagoon for an impromptu 2 hour trip and because his other group were only out for one hour he joined us later. What a wonderful peaceful and serene 2 hours!! Although ideally early morning is the best time for birds we still saw amongst many others a yellow bittern and a black bittern. Gayan was so informative. He is  passionate to try and ensure that the lagoon retained its peaceful character and I would recommend that if you do visit be prepared to converse in whispers and enjoy the tranquillity! Our biggest non wildlife surprise was that despite the impromptu nature of our visit we were still treated to fruit and home made biscuits whilst watching the local fishermen casting their nets.

We went by bus from Tangalla to the Kalametiya junction, from where Gayan picked us up by tuktuk. Try to be in the area at either sunrise or sunset, which are the best times to spot the birds, and offer the most beautiful colored landscapes!","February 18, 2015",0.0,0.0

They guide had binoculars and bird book which help and was informative. The area was not huge but I always enjoy looking at wildlife from a boat. There is no motor so slower pave plus peace and quiet is the mode of travel I am not a birder but I enjoyed the relaxed pace and after a bit I helped pole the boat for a different experience. . Price is 4,000 rupee for the boat that holds up to 7 and an takes an afternoon . So the more there are the better the deal..","January 25, 2015",0.0,0.0

You get taken by boat (no motor) through the lagoon and get to see many birds and also other animals. Best just before sunset and/or when the tide is high. Very interesting and peaceful experience. I was there two years ago and still remember how lovely it was :),"January 25, 2015",0.0,0.0

This is a protected lagoon with wild birds, which you can spot either from the Kalamatiya Road (which starts 200 meter east of the Kalamatiya Hotel) or from the lagoon with a canoe (organize with a local fisherman). The area is beautiful, quiet and full of birds. So just enjoy the area!","January 8, 2015",0.0,0.0

Many exotic birds from around the world.  BUT the screening on the cages made photography difficult. Many cages had no labeling. Nice toilet facilities. Small concession stand with snacks and ice cream. Take an umbrella for the sun.,"September 10, 2014",0.0,0.0
