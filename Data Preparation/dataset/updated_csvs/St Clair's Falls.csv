I haven’t been to this area for the past 10 years but felt very sad to see the minute flow of water through the fall. It was one of the most beautiful water falls in the country round the year with a huge flow of water flowing across it, but with the upper Kotmale hydro plant dam it has now become a skeleton which flows water only during day time     Now we have to wait until the next high rainy season to see this beauty at her full flow again.","April 25, 2017",0.0,0.0

Many people call it as the ""Little Niagara of Sri Lanka"" because of its shape is very similar to Naigara Waterfall. The falls are situated almost 3 KM west of the Talawakele on the Hatton-Talawakele Highway. St. Clairs waterfall cascades over three rock outcrops into a large pool running through a gorgeous tea estate. The waterfalls consist of two falls called ""Maha Ella"" - The Greater Fall -  which is almost 80 meters high and 50 meters wide and ""Kuda Ella"" - The Lesser Fall - which is 50 meters high and located immediately downstream of the main fall. According to the records, St Clair's falls are the 20th highest waterfall in Sri Lanka. Though its not very high, but the glory comes with the wideness of the Waterfall. In the rainy season, it is great sight to see the St. Cairs. Even you are traveling from the train, you can see the waterfall. But I recommend you to visit there by vehicle then you can enjoy the sight and feel the environment. The sad thing is, the waterfall affected by the Upper Kotmale Hydro Power Project. St. Clairs waterfall is no longer the St. Clairs which previously known. For the benefit of the public a limited quantity of water will be released to prevent complete disappearance of the fall, but that amount of water is not enough to bring the former glory, but still the sight you can get is exceptional.

You can use the viewing gallery maintained by Ceylon Electricity Board situated on Hatton -Nuwara Eliya road to have the best view of this waterfall. From what I have heard from environmental activist, this waterfall is diminishing and charm is lost due to surrounding hydro power plants and various other development activities. Nevertheless, I would still recommend this to nature lovers and road trippers.","November 17, 2016",0.0,0.0

This tea is really special whereby all the tea leaves and some flowers are being crafted by hand, so that you brew it in a hot water, it blossoms into a pretty flowers. In this case, a rose. It is probably the most expensive. Not only the fact that it is artistically handcrafted, but it is also made out of the highest quality tea leaves – which is the silver tip and golden tip tea leaves. We got it here for 1800Lakhs (RM60) for only 6 pieces. This tea centre is more accurately located at Tawakelle. It is the perfect stop over especially if you are on route between Colombo – Nuwara Eliya. It is not as big as Macwood and Bluefield but it sure has its own old planter’s charm from 100years ago.
