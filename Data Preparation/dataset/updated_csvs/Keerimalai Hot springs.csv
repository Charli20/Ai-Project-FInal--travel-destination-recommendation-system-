I tasted the water and found it slightly salty.  People believe that this freshwater spring is connected through a tunnel to the Nilvarai Bottomless Well located about 10 kilometres away.  There is no charge for bathing in the pond.  However, it costs Rs 30 to use the changing rooms with lockers. Although TripAdvisor lists this as ""hot springs"", the water is not even warm! I shall submit a modification to this heading to reflect that this is a ""fresh water"" pond as opposed to ""hot""! There are two ponds here, the larger one for males and the smaller one for females.  There are separate changing rooms too for male and female visitors.  Visitors are not permitted to use soap within ponds to prevent pollution. The miraculous powers associated with its waters are believed to cure skin infections and help childless women achieve pregnancy.  Water analysis has confirmed the presence of high mineral content in the waters. There is a large decorated hall in front meant for visitors to rest. According to legend as narrated by our guide, an Indian princess born with a deformed face begot a human pretty face after bathing in this pond! Personally speaking, I refrained from having a bath, as it is to me a public bathing place with no chlorination!

The water is warm (as it is anywhere in Jaffna) and the best is the availability of fresh water to refresh (after a sea water bath) at a small fee of LKR 20/-. It is not really hot springs as mentioned.  Located next to a hindu place of worship.  Worth including in a tour of Jaffna.  Early in the morning or late afternoon is recommended to visit due to the scorching sun.,"May 4, 2015",0.0,0.0
