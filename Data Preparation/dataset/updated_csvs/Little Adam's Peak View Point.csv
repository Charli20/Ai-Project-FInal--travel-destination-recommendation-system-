It was the perfect spot to take a moment, soak in the scenery, and feel truly connected to nature. Our guide, Sithum, made the hike even more enjoyable.

We walked from our homestay just outside the main street but you can get a tuk tuk for part of the way.  The walk is exposed so wear appropriate clothing or sunscreen, and take water. You will pass lots of small stalls on the way selling souvenirs at prices much cheaper than the main street but you will need small denominations to pay.  We did go on to the further peak (it's a bit of a goat track up the hill) and it is worth it for the extra views.  Good fun and took a little longer than expected.

Visited Aug 22nd and just about to start the climb up when there was an exodus of people descending to escape a bee swarm attack. Two women carried down fireman style by staff who literally ran down the steps. Kudos to staff, they appeared to be doing a good job evacuating, especially the two chaps who carried wounded down. One women was very badly stung and taken away by ambulance. Another half dozen walking wounded taken by truck to hospital. Returned today after the rain and had a very quiet visit. Thunderstorm an hour before meant it was virtually deserted on top. Now the ‘could do better’. Apparently drones can set bees into swarm mode. No idea if this caused yesterday’s incident, but it is a risk. There is one sign prohibiting drones, but (a) it isn’t very prominent and doesn’t say why, and (b) there is no attempt at enforcement. I had sharp words with someone about to launch today, who had no idea of the risks (probably none today after the rain, but I wasn’t taking the chance) A few more (graphic) notices about why drones are banned would raise awareness. Positive: it’s a nice view. It’s not pristine wilderness: the zip line and swing and pool bar with thumping bass will not be to everyone’s liking. But I guess these things keep general access free and provide staff cover for incidents like yesterday. Worth a visit, but if allergic to bee stings I would not risk it (same story 9-arches bridge)","August 24, 2025",0.0,0.0

I would say that it is definitely a case of “should have been here 5 years ago” - maps show a mix of trails to L A P but these have now been gated off to steer you strictly past the super tacky and out of place pool club, cafe, zip line and rock climbing wall absolutely ruining the natural feel of an outdoor walk to a view point.  We were lucky in a way that we were just after sunrise so the Insta’s, sorry “content creators” were all on their way down as we were going up (roughly 6:30 am), we actually had the peak to ourselves (plus one coconut man) for a long while.  The walk to the highest peak is easy enough (all stairs), but the walk to the next peak is a tricky scramble up and down with no stairs or rails, just slippery dirt and rocks.  Views are nice from both peaks, depends whether you prefer a more distant view down to the coast (second peak) or a view featuring the second peak.  As we were coming back, more people were arriving and there was quite a crowd heading up (these were mostly tour group type people).  So despite missing the sunrise/ best light, we do feel like we got the best timing re having the peak to ourselves for so long. In summary a nice view and walk well on its way to being ruined.

There are three tops to the climb, with the last one being a bit more challenging to reach, but the incredible views of the valley and mountains in front of you make it all worth it. One of the best things about Little Peaks Adam is its location. The main entrance to the climb is only a 15-minute walk from Kandy village, making it easy to access and a great way to spend an afternoon. And once you reach the top, you'll be rewarded with panoramic views that will take your breath away. Overall, I highly recommend Little Peaks Adam for anyone looking for a fun and rewarding outdoor adventure in Kandy. The climb is easy enough for most people to enjoy, but still challenging enough to make you feel accomplished when you reach the top. And the views are simply stunning, making it an unforgettable experience.","March 17, 2023",0.0,0.0

However, we came across an unexpected hazard.  When we reached the point where the zipline takes off, we saw a sign posted which said, “drone cameras can trigger a bee attack.”  There were no drone cameras evident, but very soon there was a bee attack.  While we escaped, my driver waiting below said that about 20 people had to be taken to the hospital.  I believe the authorities need to take care of this.  If there are bees in the vicinity of this very popular spot and inclined to attack visitors, something must be done as a whole vacation can get ruined if one gets caught in a bee attack.  Till this is sorted out, the literature should also give some guidelines for persons on how to avoid the bee attack and how to respond in case of one.  One important thing I learnt by going through Google/Bing is that you never swat or try to fend off the bees but run as fast as you can and look for shelter.  In spite of the beautiful trek, the rating reflects the hazard which the tourists were subjected to.","February 6, 2020",0.0,0.0

For Sri Lankans Sri Pada assumes huge historic and religious importance and if you eventually decide to do it you will be treading along a path that was negotiated many centuries ago by historic travelers in the caliber of Buddhist traveler Fa Hien (411–12 CE) , Italian merchant / seafarer Marco Polo (1298 CE), Arab traveler Ibn Battuta (1344 CE) and in more recent history by John Davy, brother of the Sir Humphry Davy (1817 CE) The climbing season is considered to be from December to May. Off-season climbing is possible but considered more challenging and possibly best suited for seasoned trekkers. Best time of the day to climb the mountain will be starting from night, targeting to reach the top by early morning to view the sunrise My first experience in scaling Adams Peak was in 1988 at a teenager and i have repeated the feat couple of times there after close to those times.

You can also do a zip wire down if you want also which you will see on the walk up. Not sure on the price as we did not do it, but looked fun.","January 13, 2020",0.0,0.0

We were meet at the airport by Rohan from Danulanka Tours, who would be our driver, photographer and tour guide for the next two weeks. The advantage of a local driver is not to be underestimated – as is the case in India, driving follows a set of rules that have no discernible pattern to drivers from other countries. Tolerances are measured in millimetres and cat-like reflexes are required that have been honed over many years. Rohan had an earlier career working as a photographer, which meant he was more than happy to take photographs at the various places we visited over the two weeks – a definite improvement over the clichéd selfie. Official tour guides in Sri Lanka are strictly controlled – you can be sure that any official guide will have a good knowledge of the history of any historical site in Sri Lanka. The additional benefits of a tour guide is they know when you need to arrive to get the most out your visit – whether that is to catch the ceremony at The Temple of the Tooth, or when you need to leave to get the view at World’s End, before it is obscured by cloud (5am btw, so we did a walk to Little Adam’s Peak instead). Although we had agreed a pre-defined itinerary, Rohan was more than happy to make adjustments along the way and to take into account any specific interests we had. When we commented how much better the fruit tasted in Sri Lanka than the UK, Rohan went out his way to stop en-route to pick up whatever was local to the area through which we were travelling. For example: Yellow bananas – smaller that those in the UK, but ten times more delicious. Red bananas – even nicer than yellow bananas. Mangos – several different varieties. The big ones are particularly nice, and are enough for two. Yellow coconuts – lots of milk, and then split to eat the thin white layer. Much nicer than green… Jack fruits – never heard of these before. Had the strangest consistency and taste, but definitely recommended. A drink made from a fruit that only grows in mud flats in one area of Sri Lanka – can’t remember what it was called, but it is a must try. Cashew nuts – also sold by the side of the road. Almost creamy in flavour. Rohan proved invaluable in other ways as well: on our Jeep safari through Yala National Park, he spotted a Leopard in a tree - something no-one else in the vehicle (including the driver) had spotted. We had several minutes watching the Leopard, before it decided to climb down – as the most anyone else saw that day was a tail disappearing into the scrub, I am grateful for Rohan’s keen eyesight. Sadly, since the bombing earlier this year, tourists numbers are down 80% - this means Sri Lanka is currently a real bargain. You can stay in 4 and 5 star hotels, for the price of 2 or 3 star. Finally, I will say Sri Lanka is a must visit - the people are happy and friendly, and it is clean (I think even less litter that the UK). The wildlife is plentiful, even outside the wildlife parks - this is probably helped by the predominantly Buddhist culture, and the fact that farmers are compensated for any damage done by elephants. Give Sri Lanka and Danulanka Tours a go – you will not be disappointed.","October 31, 2019",0.0,0.0

The view from every rock-part of the Adams peak is different and excellent. To overcome all four rocks you need almost 2-3 hours for enjoying all points. Take snickers and water.

Probably the best view of Ella rock and you can also see Ravana falls What we didn’t like: - very busy. Since it’s so easy to get to and there is a zip-line entrance along the way it can distract from the natural beauty of the place. What to consider: - go early or go late.

Some of the views from hikes in Ella are phenomenal with the region well known for its tea plantations and spectacular mountain ranges. If you want to enjoy some of the best views without needing to hike for hours, Little Adam’s Peak is the perfect trek, especially for an unforgettable sunset. It’s one of the top things to do in Sri Lanka if you enjoy hiking! The trail begins with a moderate incline as it winds through tea plantations. It will lead you up to 1141m above sea-level although you already begin at a high elevation so you will only hike up a few hundred meters. The trail is marked the whole way with well-maintained paths and stairs to the first set of viewpoints. There are multiple platforms, rocks, and viewpoints perfect for photos once you hit the top of Little Adam’s Peak. Although, you can and should keep going along the ridge and the view only gets better. As you continue along the ridge the trail gets a little wilder and you might get a little dirty, managing your way up and down to the final viewpoint. We hung out at the top of Little Adam’s Peak with no one else around, taking in the mountains and the epic scenery of the 360-degree views. We probably waited a little too long to head back and ended up trekking back down in the dark. For just a short hike, Little Adam’s Peak gives you unbelievable views and is the ideal way to spend sunset in Ella. Stay safe and enjoy! We warmly welcome you to Sri Lanka.. This is Sri Lanka , the little paradise which consists rich nature, culture, tradition, ancient history and so many attractions.

We did not walk all the way from our accommodation because that would have add one more hour to it because it was outside of Ella. From the bottom was just around 1 hour, it is quite easy to go up, stairs all the way. If you go in the morning 8ish, there are less people, the morning is amazing, first you passing by teagardens. Later you start to reach the steeper area there is a place where you can slide down, cost 20 USD pp, if you want to do it is better on the way back. As soon as you reach the top you willbe amazed, the view is breathtaking, you would not believe you are up so high and how beautiful the nature is. There is the actuall Peak, for that you need to climb down and up again on the mountain but it worth it. From here you can also see in the distance Ravana Fall. After Little Adam's Peak, we went to see the Nine Arch Bridge, unfortunately, took us a bit longer because we went on the wrong way, but that is a different review. You do need to visit the Peak if you are there, even if you have only a couple of days in Ella and go in the morning, if you can enjoy the sunrise from here.","April 23, 2019",0.0,0.0

Setting off early in the morning to avoid the heat we assume, it is a fairly steady walk along for a while, then a climb up some steps to the top. You do not need to be an Olympic athlete to climb this, but a certain level of fitness is required, and the last bit is quite steep; those used to walking and hiking should find it a breeze. The whole climb up and back took approx. 2 hours, but you will definitely work up a sweat doing so !  I would strongly recommend sensible footwear e.g. trainers or walking shoes, and some water ! On the way up we passed some tea pickers in the fields next to the path, who were more than happy to pose for some pictures, for a small reward / LKR tip of course ! Once at the top there is another good photo opportunity stood next to the small statue / shrine, and then some absolutely stunning views over the surrounding countryside and the valley below. There is a large rock ledge where everyone takes their turn to stand on or dangle their legs over the edge and take photos. On the way back down we passed the tea pickers again, who were now having some food - probably lunch since they start so early in the morning ?  There was also a little coconut / drinks shack hut that had opened up on the way down, where you can buy a well deserved cold drink to cool down with. A very enjoyable way to see more of the great beauty of Sri Lanka.","April 16, 2019",0.0,0.0
