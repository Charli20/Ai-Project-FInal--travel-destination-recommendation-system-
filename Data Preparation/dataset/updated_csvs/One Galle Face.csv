I forgot to update my OGF points from the PVR at the top floor which can be used for the parking. So when I came down to concierge I asked them to update. I showed them the Mobile ticket which the PVR sends to your mobile when you purchase the ticket online. It includes all the details - date/ location / amount, etc. But they refused to update saying it is not a valid ticket. And asked me to go all the way up and get a receipt and come back. I asked them why do you need another ticket and their response was mobile tickets are not valid. I wasn't going to waste my time again to go all the way up 6 floors and get receipts just to use for my parking. But the point is the level of quality of the staff at OGF. 1. No proper training. 2. Not aware that the Mobile tickets / E-tickets are valid similarly in this day and age as to a printed ticket. 3. Not even bothered to check with the PVR if it is valid or not. 4. Not even bothered to even check with one of their managers. 5. Not even option on their OGF site to even put a complaint. (Probably why the two receptionists at the counter said its okay when I told them that I will complaint) All in all I can think of is staff quality and training needs to be improved.","January 4, 2024",0.0,0.0

And very rude. Since I and my friend was sitting near the British pub near the PVR cinema hall and was talking without the mask on me for the few minutes he was so rude and kept on coming and shouting at us. There were plenty of others too who wasn’t wearing the mask, but he specifically came and was asking if we cannot wear our mask to leave the premises. Really it was a bad incidence, I came there for lunch at the Indian restaurant and had some shopping at the mall and then came to relax and have a chat but this security just messed up my whole mood. Plus if it was equal to everyone I don’t mind. But that man just specifically came coz it was only two girls and no man to shout at him. Plus Most of the people who Worked there didn’t have the mask on them. But I don’t understand why he specifically came to us and was rudely talking and trying ask us to move out of the building. I’ll keep my friends also informed about my bad experience about this place. I normally recommend and this was my 4th visit to one Galle Face, because it looked very professional.  And will never want to step in to one Galle face again. This is so bad experience.","July 1, 2020",0.0,0.0

The initial visit found many shops yet to open, poorly signposted to find one’s way around, possibly only one interactive information on level 1(street) and one with two staff, who I found were not able to give clear directions, e.g. ago this way rather than ‘turn to your right and walk to the end and take the escalator up’.  Think staff need training on dealing with the types of questions put to them. Yesterday I had limited time and shopped at Odel and Genelle, the former because I expected larger range than Ward Place, actually was less though very good discounts in Men’s wear, my focus; the latter because I heard Genelle’s design range at this mall was unique and unavailable at other outlets. Again good shopping for shoes, and as a week day, not crowded. The mall’s spacious layout very pleasant, airy and the atrium style height takes away the claustrophobic feeling of many of Colombo’s older malls. People were still snapping pics in front of Christmas decor. However, modern design seems not to extend to basics such as signposting so the shopper can be independent and confident how to find what they want, lack of ATMs and almost abysmal directions to reach the pick-up drop-off point. If you ordered a cab and it’s arriving getting out of the building even from level 1 through the many exits and security entrances very poorly signposted and a nightmare. Added to which the fittings over the exit I was heading to fell off just missing the man in front of me. That exit could no longer be used as the wiring above the doors obstructed movement. On service at the two shops I visited, staff at Genelle (only two it seemed) were good, brought shoes out and helped me fit. At Odel though, there were many staff around, seemingly disinterested in selling or directing me to what I needed. I was drawn to some items on discount. Staff attitude seemed to expect me to remember the clothing and each discount. Floor staff seemed incompetent in dealing with the complexity of different discounts on different items which the customer was expected to work out. One staffer gave me the original cost of the item when I inquired if it was on discount, had to go to the cashier and return to me to give me the final price. The simplest would have been for management to have had both pre and post discounts indicated on the price tag. Finally, at the pay counter staff were unable to give me the costs of the discounted items I’d picked, very confusing for a customer, with their different discount rates, making it hard for a customer to decide what to buy. An alternate at that point might have been to have had one staffer give me the final cost on each item, especially as there were no other shoppers paying at either of the two cashiers at the time.","January 8, 2020",0.0,0.0

An area where there should a big improvement is the arcade, its very old and outdated most of the machines don’t work and they are very very old, and the worst part is the entire game interface is in Chinese so you don’t understand what you are supposed to do. The mall for now I would say is less kid friendly in terms of entertainment. But hopefully as things are falling into place it would be improved. The Dilmah tea lounge is amazing as usual, a place that rarely disappoints adds up to a place that will settle you down after an exhausting shopping day.","December 21, 2019",0.0,0.0

So the only options we had was to checkout the malls and spend time at the Galle face green. This mall is right in front of the beach and it has been recently opened (8th November, 2019). It gives you kind of a luxury feel. I have seen multiple such malls around the world but have to admit that it was the first one in Sri Lanka where I could say the word ""luxury"". The lower ground floor has a lot of restaurants and a Kells store where you can buy the daily needs stuff at good price. We bought tea and chocolates from here. The restaurants are pretty good too. Although we only tried Pizza hut here. The mall is biggest in Colombo and have a lot of international brands for shopping. The USP of the mall is its location though.","December 1, 2019",0.0,0.0

First proper mall in Sri Lanka and it was massive! I had a great time in their luxury cinema PVR where they serve you meals as you watch the movie and where the seats are so comfy you can fall asleep. There was so much to do in the mall: from the arcade with VR and a bunch of games, the playzone area for little kids and even an area where children can drive small toy cars. They had a huge variety of food at the food court in the basement and at the restaurants on the 6th floor (even the theatre had tasty food). The mall had so many different shops from luxury watch stores like Rolex and luxury shoe stores like Aldo, to stores affordable by everyone such as Glitz (and even a salon 🤯) On the otherhand, my only feedback that I can give is to add more ATM machines. There was only 1 ATM machine located on the 5th floor and it didn't even work. This was weird for such a huge mall as it made it hard to withdraw cash to actually buy stuff from the mass number of stores. If they fix that problem and add more ATMs I have nothing else I want before being able to say it's a perfect mall. It was even more amazing considering they just opened and how Colombo City Center was so empty once it was opened. Overall fantastic experience and would recommend.","November 28, 2019",0.0,0.0

It is over hyped in the advertising blurb as ‘an integrated lifestyle destination for different communities; this iconic oceanfront is an intimately woven tapestry of the best international brands.’ But there is more to this Shangri La development, than just the Shopping Mall. It is bounded on the north by the Shangri La Hotel and 2 residential blocks on the south side. But it is the shopping mall that most people will experience and very impressive it is too. Spacious, bright, cool and clean. Most of the exclusive retail outlets are here, together with a huge variety of temping restaurants and food outlets. We found it difficult to find our way around. There appeared to be no guides or maps to help us and we had to ask where specific stores were. Although the directory gives the address of each store, it is not shown over the entrance doors. If it was, it would help to find other stores. There were surprisingly few people in the evening, at a time when it should be crowded, when we were there. But perhaps most people have yet to discover No 1 Galle Face, the newest Mall in town.","November 22, 2019",0.0,0.0
