The place has a unique texture of sand that you hardly find anywhere else. The sand is pink in color and there is absolutely no flora and fauna here. As per Hindu mythology this was the very place where ravana had his airport and was burnt by lord hanuman. Scientist suggest there is certain meteorite attack that has happened here leading to enormous heat. The place offers a magnificent view of the sea and is really Picturesque.

It’s popular for its reddish soil content throughout. Named as a national park, solely for the uniqueness of the surrounding area. View of sea from the cliff is very beautiful. Must visit in evening after 5 pm. Otherwise the heavy sun shine won’t give you a chance to enjoy the views. It takes around 1 hour to have a walk around and enjoy sometime at the beach. It’s not recommended to have a sea bath here since the sea is deep and rough around here. It’s bit tricky to find the path to this place. Don’t solely rely on google maps.

This is a geographically interesting place with Red soil in barren landscape bordering to the sea. It is said (according to google and what people say) that a meteorite has fallen in the past here but I'm not sure whether this is correct or not. Lot of small birds around who feed on the low growing grass. The actual landscape is not that interesting looking when you go there as compared to what's on the google images. From the car park, there's about 15mins talk (easy walk) to the sea. You can't actually go to the beach due to cliff. This place is poorly signposted. There is a sign post where you turn off from the main highway, but no signposting after that. The turn off at highway is at Nonagama (in Google maps, search Ussangoda Car park). Locals will give the direction however. There are few shops selling local fresh orange juice at the car part. We went there on our way to Yala,, but this is a place you can easily skip in my opinion. For what it's worth,,, may be the National Park authority can install some educational information there so visitors can learn bit more about this location and history and why the soil is Red etc. etc., and the significance of this area to the local ecology. Currently there's zero information. (when we visited in December 2016).","March 31, 2017",0.0,0.0
