Built in 1873 by the British, they are a century younger than the Dutch ones.  The old gate is located behind the bastion of the Sun. They bear the Dutch abbreviation VOC (Vereinigte Oostindische Compagnie), the East India Company of the United Provinces, and a shield with the company's symbols - two lions and a rooster and the date 1669. The rooster (Gallo), which gave the name to the fort and the city, was inherited from the Portuguese, because they began building the fort back in 1588, limiting themselves to a wall from the land, because The Sinhalese kingdoms of Kotte and Kandy did not have a fleet, and they could not be afraid of attacks from the sea. The walls from the land (the bastion of the Moon with a Clock tower and the bastion of the Sun) are more powerful than from the sea. The Dutch had already built walls from the sea since 1649, rightly reasoning that it was not so much the local population that should be feared as colonizers from Europe. Just like them. The fears were not unfounded, and the fort was captured by the British in 1796, taking advantage of the occupation of the Netherlands by the French in 1795. At the same time, the fort, which had been fortified for so long, did not fire a single shot. The bastion at the old gate is the oldest.  It was built by the Portuguese, but its name is Dutch - Zwart.  Those who know German can guess by the consonance that it is ""black"".  Previously, the remains of the 17th-century Dutch ship Avondster, which sank nearby, were nearby, but they were washed out to sea in the terrible summer of 2004. The fort's 15 bastions, by the way, withstood the impact of the deadliest tsunami in history, which claimed the lives of almost 300,000 people in coastal countries. This proves once again in hindsight the level of the Dutch school of fortification. South of Zwart stands the Ackersloot bastion, erected shortly before the British captured it in 1789 and named after the birthplace of Captain Coster, who captured Halle in 1640. The eastern wall ends with the Utrecht bastion, also named after the famous Dutch city, the birthplace of football player Marco van Basten and erotic star Sylvia Kristel (""Emmanuel"") (joke). There is a lighthouse built in 1938 on the cape nearby. Previously, before the lighthouse, signalmen from the Flag Rock bastion warned ships about the danger of rocks. In case of fog, the signal was given by the Musketeers. They shot from the nearest Pigeon Island, which could be reached from the fort at low tide. The inhabitants of the Netherlands could not do without their favorite wind turbines.  They installed it on the Triton bastion on the eastern wall. This is done specifically in the direction of the prevailing wind direction. The blades of the windmill rotated the gears of a pump that lifted seawater up. The Dutch watered the streets with it. But for sewage, the Dutch used the energy of the tides. At high tide, the water entered the network, and at low tide, it washed the feces into the sea. The old system is still working, so swimming near the fort is not recommended.","November 23, 2025",0.0,0.0

The cobblestones gleamed black under the deluge. Every few minutes, a persistent Tuk Tuk driver would whir up beside us, undeterred by our soaked state, and pitch a tour. ""No, thank you!"" we'd laugh, pushing on. We found a brief respite atop the massive fort wall, the wind whipping our clothes and the umbrella turned upside down as we watched the grey ocean churn below. The weather meant we couldn't complete the full circuit of the twelve historic bastions, but we did lose ourselves in the musty cool of the Historical Mansion Museum. Inside, forgotten relics of the colonial past—old appliances, housewares, photographs and heavy teak furniture—told silent stories. The best part? Entry didn't cost a cent.

However, there was a natural Harbor which was active. In 1344 Iban Battuta landed here. It proves that there was an active harbor at that time. Also, three sides of this area were covered by sea and only one side have the access from land. So, they observed it is very secured place for them to build their Bastian.

He even offered to fetch me cheap beers if i wanted from a place cheaper than cargills that the locals use.

We observed that some of the ancient walls that looked very sturdy were built using large coral segments binding them with a mortar. Some tracks or stairways to the inner area of the rampart may be to the dungeons or store rooms were not accessible. Several of these spots needed a good clean up as different types of rubbish have been thrown into them. Those locations were unsightly.

Situated on a scenic headland in southern Sri Lanka, this UNESCO World Heritage site is a perfect spot for history buffs and nature lovers alike. The Dutch Fort, with its well-preserved walls and remarkable ramparts, stands tall, offering breathtaking views of the ocean on three sides. It’s not just the views that make it special, but the ambiance of the place—the quiet streets, vibrant colonial architecture, and the sense of stepping back in time to the days of ancient trade routes. What I found most captivating was the rich history that surrounds the Fort. Did you know that this city is believed to have once traded with King Solomon, the Egyptians, and the Persians? That’s what makes a visit here so much more than just a stroll through old buildings—it’s a deep dive into Sri Lanka’s fascinating past. Take a leisurely walk along the fortifications, explore the various boutique shops, and enjoy the peaceful sunsets over the sea. It’s the perfect combination of history and natural beauty, ideal for anyone looking to explore the true essence of Galle. Pro Tips: Wear comfortable shoes as you’ll want to explore every corner of the Fort. The sunset views from the ramparts are something you don’t want to miss!

My recent visit to this architectural marvel was nothing short of spectacular, offering a unique experience of walking through centuries-old cobblestone streets while indulging in modern luxuries. A Walk Through History Originally built by the Portuguese in 1588 and later fortified by the Dutch in the 17th century, Galle Fort has withstood the test of time, including tsunamis, wars, and changing civilizations. As I stepped inside the fort, I could feel the echoes of its colonial past—massive stone walls, ancient churches, and Dutch-style buildings standing resiliently against the backdrop of the Indian Ocean. One of the most fascinating aspects of Galle Fort is how history coexists with modernity. While some ruins tell tales of the past—like the crumbling bastions and weathered old warehouses—many colonial-era buildings have been beautifully restored and converted into boutique hotels, cafés, art galleries, and luxury shops. Modern Elegance Amidst Ruins Despite being a centuries-old structure, Galle Fort has evolved into a vibrant, upscale destination. The streets are lined with stylish cafés, high-end boutiques, chic restaurants, and boutique hotels, giving it a European-inspired coastal town vibe. It’s a rare sight where you find luxury brands, artisanal ice cream shops, and handcrafted jewelry stores sitting inside historic Dutch-era buildings! While it has become modernized and somewhat commercialized, it hasn’t lost its old-world charm. The fort still preserves its ancient ramparts, lighthouses, old trading posts, and stone-paved alleyways, making it a unique destination where the past meets the present. Must-Visit Spots in Galle Fort 1. Galle Lighthouse One of the most picturesque and Instagram-worthy spots in the fort, this 19th-century lighthouse offers breathtaking views of the Indian Ocean. It’s a perfect spot to catch a golden sunset or simply enjoy the sea breeze. 2. The Dutch Hospital Shopping Precinct A beautifully restored colonial-era hospital that has now been transformed into a modern shopping and dining hub. This area is perfect for those looking to enjoy fine dining, sip cocktails, or shop for unique souvenirs. 3. The Ramparts & Bastions Walking along the fort’s ancient walls is an experience in itself. These massive stone fortifications once protected the fort from invasions and now serve as a stunning viewpoint for both history lovers and photographers. Sunsets here are absolutely magical! 4. Historical Churches & Museums • Dutch Reformed Church (Groote Kerk): Built in 1755, this church is one of the oldest Protestant churches in Sri Lanka. • National Maritime Museum: Showcases artifacts from shipwrecks and colonial-era maritime history. • All Saints’ Church: A gorgeous Anglican church with intricate architecture and serene surroundings. 5. Flag Rock & Sunset Point At the far end of the fort lies Flag Rock, an old Portuguese watchtower that has now become a popular cliff-jumping and sunset-viewing spot. Watching the waves crash against the rocks while the sun dips below the horizon is an unforgettable experience. 6. The Quirky Streets & Hidden Alleys One of the best things to do in Galle Fort is to simply wander through its narrow, maze-like streets, each filled with hidden gems—antique shops, quirky cafés, street art, and local handicrafts. The vibe here is laid-back yet lively, perfect for leisurely exploration. The Food Scene – A Gastronomic Delight! Galle Fort has become a foodie’s paradise, offering everything from Sri Lankan seafood specialties to international fine dining.

It's interesting to wander, plus it's cool inside. A little loses to an old Dutch fort somewhere near India's Kochi - there are better preserved buildings and streets. Which wasn't impressive. As is likely everywhere in this part of the globe - garbage and the impassable feeling that the wipers have been on strike for at least a couple of weeks.

The Fort is well worth several short visits, especially late afternoon and sunset, rather than trying to cram everything into a single sweltering day.  The Tuk Tuks in Galle are excellent - honest, very friendly and knowledgeable. Don't spend USD 100+ for day trips booked online, when you can do far better in your personal Tuk Tuk at less than a third of the cost.  Our Tuk Tuk driver, Nalin (Whats App +94 77 835 9763) was amazing and one of the best we had in Sri Lanka. He took us to the local fish and vegetable markets, then an afternoon trip to Marissa beach with stops along the way. Nalin even helped us buy spices, at local prices, not the inflated tourist prices. We had lots of time to enjoy sunset cocktails, then a seafood dinner at one of the beach restaurants, before heading back to our hotel.

The young entrepreneurial owners are Dhammika and Shalika. Sourced direct from the owner’s Cinnamon garden in Galle District, this shop offers superior quality Cinnamon quills and oils. In their garden, they have only true Cinnamon bushes (Cinnamomum Verum, also known as Cinnamomum Zeylanicum) which is native to Sri Lanka. Environmentally friendly practices such as not using pesticides add value to their products. Like many people in Western countries, we have been disillusioned by the poor quality quills offered in Australian shops as “Cinnamon” where a tiny quantity of true Cinnamon bark is wrapped in hard Cassia bark (also known as Chinese Cinnamon). So, we were pleased that in this shop, we can in fact buy quills that are made entirely of true Cinnamon (no Cassia involved). If you must have top quality true Cinnamon (to add spice to your trip to Sri Lanka) then this shop offers Alba grade Cinnamon (other lower grades are also available at a lower price). Dhammika and Shalika are extremely busy with Cinnamon production as well as attending to their shop. Understandably, they are not in a position to offer you visits to their Cinnamon garden. But they would be ready to offer you insights on Ceylon Cinnamon and other spice products. Asoka Note: For this Review, to verify claims, Asoka was granted a visit to the Cinnamon Garden and production facilities. This enabled us to take several photos shown below.","January 23, 2024",0.0,0.0

Historic Clock Tower  - head south into the interior of the Fort 3. Museum - small fee to enter, interesting, only small. 4. Dutch Reform Church – can enter, FREE 5. We skipped the Maritime Museum 6. Old Main Gate, 7. Restored Dutch Hospital (up market shops, cafes and restaurants). Then continue south. 8. Famous Galle Lighthouse (not open to the public) Corner of Hospital and Rampart St, overlooking The Beach, then follow the walls to 9. Meeran Mosque (open to go inside, remove shoes) 10. Flag Rock. There was a friendly chap willing to dive off the cliff for a fee. I am sure he has the experience and knows what he is doing  but it looked quite unsafe. Nobody took him up whilst we were there. 11. Triton Bastion.  Along the way there are ammunition bunkers if your interested. 12. Shopping in Pedlar Street – narrow cobblestone laneways. At this point we ambled around the streets looking at various shops, had some lunch, tried a couple of different bars and generally relaxed. 13. The walk finishes at Star Bastion, overlooking the northern coast towards Hikkaduwa. 14.

You can take as much photos as you can as the view is just beautiful with the ocean beach  overlooking the lovely lighthouse what else can I ask for. To think of it's just not the lighthouse, but as a solo explorer, your feet will just take you around the fort, to get a view of the city area if you walk all throughout the end.  This place is nice to see by afternoon evening time to see the sunset, in the night to have a snap of the lighthouse and seeing stars on the sky, and also in the early morning between before 6 am to have a walk or jog around while seeing the Sunrise! It's just amazing. Early morning vibes in this place is quite, not so crowd, you can see locals and few foreign walking exercising, jogging, photo shooting. Locals are friendly, got some small talks in between. I am lucky not to be scammed. Tips: See the place by sunset and sunrise and night time Bring a small bottle of water while walking around and a folded umbrella, evening time may rain with few rain showers. Bring some snacks while enjoying the view it's like picnic in the fort. Bring a selfie stick or a small tripod if your on solo. Early morning activities recommended.

The whole process of communication was very easy via WhatsApp. He met us at the pre-arranged meeting spot, gave us some great history under the shade of trees. He asked us our preferences and then our experience began. Following Shanjei through little backstreets and corridors of the inner sanctuary of the Fort was very interesting. He had some wonderful tales of history and cheeky gossip that was both amusing and educational. We finished our tour by offering him a beverage and he found a beautiful place with a rooftop bar for us to finish on. After our time together we felt very confident walking around the Fort and we stayed and had a lovely massage at one of the spa salons in the old town. We had lunch at another of Shenjei’s recommendations,  a rooftop restaurant with amazing views. We highly recommend this wonderful experience because Shanjei has a way of bringing the old fort to life.

They started building the fort as seen in its present form in the Dutch architectural style. Fortifications were added up to the early 18th century. The British took over the fort on 23 February 1796, one week after Colombo was captured. Sri Lanka remained a British colony formally from 1815 till it became an independent island nation in 1948. The importance of Galle also declined after the British developed Colombo as their capital and main port in the mid nineteenth century. Today the Sri Lankan government and many Dutch people who still own some of the properties inside the fort are looking at making this one of the modern wonders of the world!  This work is going on still very slowly, I guess there is not enough money yet to build up the Fort to this modern wonder. Maybe the next generation!?","November 2, 2019",0.0,0.0

The moment it became a drizzle, we grabbed our guide and off we went for our planned Fort tour. The drizzle then became a small storm. We were not dressed properly to take in the relentless wind and poodle of water, with our umbrellas threatening to fly away during our walk around the walls for defensive purposes. It was the most speculator sea ever. Gazing out, I could imagine how the four metres high waves swept over the train station and bus station located right next to the Fort, and those inhabitants in houses on that Boxing Day. Our Tuk Tuk driver told us his then fiancé had an urgent need to pray at the temple really early that morning.  Everything and everyone in her family was gone upon her return. He then took her in and gave her a home. I’d told him to treasure her - what immense luck to be the sole survivor. We entered the Fort from the old main gate. The walls were erected by the Portuguese in the 1500s and later added on by the Dutch and the English. During the walk, the guide pointed out the Fort Lighthouse and the many Bastions. The UNESCO Fort was truly a fusion of fantastic European architecture with Asian influence. The 300 year-old Dutch Reform Church was a humble establishment. No one was in there during our visit. The stained glass panels were worth looking at. We ended our tour at our hotel. I so named the City of Galle as the City of Gale right after our eventful walk that day.","October 13, 2019",0.0,0.0

It cost us 500Sr each way (£2). Our first driver offered to wait for us but there really is no need. There’s loads of tuk tuks around and it was easy getting back to our hotel. We had a leisurely walk around the walls which took about 40 mins at a slow pace. Along the way there was a very picturesque lighthouse and for cricket fans; a cracking view of the Galle Stadium. We also wandered the streets inside the walls, which had a very chilled out vibe and bags of colonial Dutch charm. Loads of restaurants around if you fancy a refreshment break.

On the last morning i was going to go snorkelling around the rock's near the lighthouse. There are a pile of tyres filled with concrete where i was going to swim, i wondered why they were there so had a look. It is where the sewer comes out into the sea, grey fetid stinking sewage.

I’m sorry to say this, I was there yesterday, but I wouldn’t recommend a visit for those wanting to see the best of Sri Lanka. The Fort has piles of rubbish lining its beaches and down small side alleys, not just the odd plastic bottle. No one seemed to care. It is expensive to stay and eat. While shop owners and restauranteurs where accommodating and welcoming, the overall atmosphere was one of complacency. I think we may have been scammed into donating to a children’s nursery too - it’s seemed genuine but it was hard to tell because of the way it was done. I left Galle rather depressed and hoping the rest of my time in Sri Lanka would be much better. I’ve only ever heard good things about the country.","March 12, 2019",0.0,0.0
