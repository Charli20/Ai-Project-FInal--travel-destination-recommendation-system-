Incidentally, it was built by the adopted son of a Sinhala King, Parakramabahu VI of the Kotte Kingdom, who built it for the benefit of the Hindu populace of Jaffna after defeating the invading forces of the Vijayanagar Empire of South India. The original Nallur Kovil was razed to the ground by the Portuguese and later rebuilt in an adjacent location by the Dutch in 1734. The Nallur Kovil, set amidst the scorched terrain of the North, still has a sacredness that is radiated in the front courtyard, the Dravidian architecture and the majestic and ornately carved gopuram or tower at the entrance.

This symbolises Lord Murugan’s assured protection to those who worship and pray to grant their wishes and seek his protection. The temple has majestic Gopuram ( decorative tower) facing east, south and north. Whilst the east gopuram has five storeys in its elevation, the south and north have seven storeys. Each storey is adorned with god’s sculptures , typical of any hindu temple. The east gopuram is especially beautiful as it also houses a decorative arch. As is common with all hindu temples there is a small pond near the south gopuram. The interior of the temple carries excellent wall paintings depicting stories , decorated wooden structures and  small grotos for Lord Ganesha, Lord Murugan’s consorts Valli and Devayanai, infant Krishna, Sun and the Trident. The main annual festival is held for 27 days beginning on the New moon day in the tamil month of Aadi and lasts till the new moon day in the month of Avani ( typically the entire month of August).This is a major attraction of Jaffna not to be missed and visitors come here specially to pray at the temple.

The main temple building is massive, although quite dark and dingy in places. No photography is allowed inside, which is understandable but slightly regrettable in that there are some wonderful painted murals that I would have liked to share with others. Worshippers make a contribution of precisely 1 Rp (for which you even get a receipt!), which I think is a beautiful concept - it is the same for everyone, from pauper to president 🙂 Men must remove their shirts when entering this, or indeed any, Hindu temple.

However, we did our research and donned a sarong to cover our lower half.  The Hindu Temple Nallur Kandaswamy temple is situated in the not so tourist area of Jaffna. Visitors before entering the Temple complex must remove their shoes; men need to remove their shirts as well. The Temple is about 1.5km northeast of the centre. It is exceptionally beautifully colourful, as one would expect from a Hindu Temple dedicated to sacred deity is Lord Murugan (or Skanda). One thing that struck me was the friendliness of the devotees and visitors entering the Temple complex.  Even though we could not speak Tamil or Sinhalese the people actually pushed us into places where we could view the ceremony of the ""Puja"" and then took us by hand to the following 3 or 4 places so as we could be and feel integrated into the ceremonial process. In western religions it's normally first come first served and you're pushed out of the way by the surge of petitions and penitents trying to gain a favour or miracle from the devotion.  But here the people were so keen for us to see the adoration of their gods and the ceremony unfold that we were at times led by the hand to ""the next installment"" - for want of a better phrase. Then once the ceremony had finished we wandered around the Temple complex and some visitors - from the southern part of India,  took us to one side and helped us understand what we had just witnessed Several friendly priests, some of whom speak English, can answer questions about the temple and its traditions. Do go to this and any Temple that you find near you on your visits and be inspired and blessed as we were that day at The Nallur Kandaswamy Temple.","March 28, 2016",0.0,0.0

Those who are interested in taking a look at the culture, this is a good place to visit. There are ceremonious offerings which are done on particular times of the day and they are called ""poojas"". I went for the one that was at ten o'clock in the morning. Men are not allowed to go into this temple without removing their shirts. It is considered a sign of disrespect if men walk into the ""Kovil"" (Temple) wearing the shirt. Before entering this shrine people are expected to remove their footwear and wash their feet. There are small square shaped incense lumps for sale outside the shrine. Most of the people who go in buy these so that they can burn these incense lumps inside the kovil. Some people also buy coconuts and smash them outside the temple. This is a symbolic way of expecting the interior of your soul to be pure and clear like the insides of the coconut. The tamil people believe that it is best to have your coconut smashed into tiny pieces because it is representative of the vanishing of all evil in a person. Inside the temple there are ""poosaries"" (the religious leaders). Anyone from the Tamil community cannot become a poosary. The caste system is quite prevalent amongst the Tamil community up to date and the poosaries are only selected from the highest class of Brahmis. There are small tickets to purchase and it costs Rs. 1.00 and once you hand this over to the poosary and tell your name and starsign he blesses you.","December 1, 2012",0.0,0.0

It was interesting to see not only those of the Hindu faith worshipping but also devout Buddhists and Catholics as well. Of course, shoes must be removed at the gate.
