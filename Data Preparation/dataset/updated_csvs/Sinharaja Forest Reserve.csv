This is not to be missed. Thisara is a trained naturalist and really knows his stuff, especially the birds but also mammals, reptiles etc. His English is excellent and he was very good company on the drive. It is a 2 hour drive in an airconditioned car (with a separate driver) to the reserve, along very good roads through pretty countryside and rice paddies and and gradually climbing past tea plantations. The reserve entrance has good parking and clean toilets - and a few resident Blue Magpies, a species unique to Sri Lanka. This was a taste of things to come. We picked up one of the local villagers that is employed by the reserve to take people into it (included in the price, but who I tipped). He found us all sorts of interesting things (some photos below): flowers (eg orchids), MANY butterflies and other insects, trees and shrubs, lots of birds, several different lizard species, a snake, frogs, squirrels, monkeys. Many of these are species unique/endemic to Sri Lanka. Between the 2 guides I learned an awful lot. The walking is easy going along very good paths - concrete at first (to all for vehicular access) then well-tended paths through the rainforest. Leech socks were provided along with water. I took a few cakes to eat as we were out in the reserve for a good 3 or 4 hours. The forest has a wonderful calm to it, it felt totally safe and I enjoyed the company. I highly recommend this trip to anyone with an interest in the natural world.","November 2, 2025",0.0,0.0

We stayed 3 days at The Martin's Lodge which is the ideal place to stay overnight if your purpose of the visit is to experience the wonderful nature and wildlife at the Sinharaja. The accommodation is quite basic but more than adequate for the avid nature lover with running water, electricity and spacious rooms with bedlinen. I had met Mr Martin several decades ago when he was a guide of the reserve. He was someone who had contributed immensely toward conservation of the forest and the species. After his passing, his family is running the lodge and they are very hospitable and provide the visitors with very good service and delicious Sri Lankan meals. A 4x4 vehicle is required to arrive at the lodge but the location is then only 5 minutes from the entrance. There is a lovely view of the forest and the surrounding area from the dining area and a fruit feeder and the gardens attract several species of Sri Lanka's rare endemic birds such as the Blue Magpie, the Yellow-eared Bulbul, the Spot-winged Thrush, the Square-tailed Bulbul, the Jungle Fowl and the Spur Fowl. This hilly virgin rain-forest, part of the Sri Lanka lowland rain forests, was once saved from a disastrous commercial logging in the 70's. Then it was designated a World Biosphere Reserve in 1978 and a World Heritage Site in 1988. I have been visiting Sinharaja for over twenty years and I have had many wonderful sightings of some rare birds of Sri Lanka over the years. Sinharaja being Sri Lanka's primary tropical rain-forest, most of the Flora & Fauna here are endemic and this is their final refuge. This time, among the rare and uncommon birds we spotted, the Serendib Scops Owl, the Green-billed Coucal and the Red-faced Malkoha were unforgettable sightings. May these endemic birds that are found nowhere else in the world but in the rainforests of Sri Lanka, prevail for long!","October 15, 2025",0.0,0.0

It was an hour in a jeep on a  very steep, rough road to get 8 km to the ecolodge but so worth it.  Sri Lanka is trying to develop its wildlife conservancy and National Parks and this area is a biodiversity hot spot of international significance which has been designated a Biosphere Reserve and World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The ecolodge accommodation was clean, but a little worn. Don't expect room service or luxurious accommodation, there are no televisions. The limited a la carte menu options were very good. When we stayed the lodge did not have a license allowing it to serve alcohol but our driver warned us ahead of time in case we wanted to BYO. We did some gentle walks during the night and day. The area apparently has leopards, civet cats and fishing cats but we only saw their droppings and claw marks in trees. We saw monkeys, deer, frogs, other invertebrates, loads of birds, waterfalls, old growth forest and pools filled with fish which nibble your feet. Some of the communal areas were being revamped whilst we were there but this was not in any way intrusive. It was a very peaceful stay, fairly basic but if you love rainforests and want to support Sri Lanka's fledgling eco tourism industry you won't be disappointed.","September 25, 2025",0.0,0.0

We booked only a few days before heading to Deniyaya, and we felt so lucky Danu was available. He arranged a tuktuk to collect us from our accommodation and led us on a wonderful forest adventure. His sharp eyes spotted critters which were almost invisible to us, and at one point he saw a shadow on the ground and got us to look up just in time to see a giant black eagle soaring above. He showed us a hidden path to sit under one of the waterfalls, which we really loved. All along our hike, he shared his knowledge and love of the forest with us. On a practical note, he provided sturdy leech socks and sprayed our shoes and legs with repellent, which really helped us feel more comfortable (we went in mid-April when leeches abound). He also brought water and really delicious local snacks with him, which we hadn't seen before, and loved tasting. It was exactly the kind of immersive nature experience we were after, and we'd highly recommend him as a guide. Contact him on +94 77 525 4886 to book a tour.","April 19, 2025",0.0,0.0

For unprepared sports people, a short route (about 3 hours) is better, we are tired of walking towards its end, but it was very interesting and beautiful. Mandatory closed clothes, I tucked my pants into my socks, but the leech was able to bite even through the sock. Upon entering the forest, the guide gave anointing of his feet and boots with an ointment like a star. They saw a snake as thin as a string, lizards, snails, spiders, squirrels, monkeys, owls, chameleons. The guide, a forest worker, liked-carefully noticed any leaf movement and showed the beetle/bird, etc., which without him we would not have noticed. Very high humidity, heavy air, sweaty.

Had a pleasant stay at the resort that had a waterfall right in its own back yard, and then arranged with Danushka to be our guide in the rainforest trek the next morning. He came with a safari jeep and driver, picked us up at 8am and we entered the reserve by about 9.30. The road up was quite windy but extremely scenic. Entry into the Reserve was a breeze. Inside we were given our leech socks that covered till the knee area, and shoes were sprayed. The hike was amazing, we covered two of the three waterfalls, and were given a good explanation of the plants and animals we encountered. The dipping of our feet at the waterfalls was a tingling sensation as the many small fish nibbled on the skin. The rocks were very slippery and even though we had good hiking shoes, they did not grip on the wet rocks, so we had to be very careful. After 4 hours we were back at the jeep and exited. Had a memorable day there. Leeches still cling onto your knee high socks and shoes, and we got used to removing them with our hands as we saw our guide do this. If you did get stung, they suck your blood, you feel some pain but it is not fatal, so not to worry about these parasites too much. Best to do in morning, as it rains almost every afternoon. You cannot hike on your own and must engage a registered guide. Estimates of cost for 4 persons inclusive of entrance fee, guide, safari jeep, leach socks and spray was 12800 rupees for 4 pax which I thought was reasonable, other guides charge more.

It fully justifies the appellation of a World Heritage Site . On my first afternoon we birdied around the village . Our first bird was Serendip Scops Owl quickly followed by another I endemic Sri Lankan Rufous Babbler . Other sightings included : Hanging Parrot , Small Barbet , Pale-billed Flowerpecker and Indian Pygmy Woodpecker . Early next morning we entered the forest, glad to be on foot  after a steep bone shaking jeep ride . Our first new mammal was the curious Purple-faced Leaf Monkey followed by another selection of great birds , including : Spot-winged Ground Thrush , Legge’s Flowerpecker , a pair of Frogmouths , Ashy-headed Laughing Thrush , Malabar Trogon , Velvet-fronted Nuthatch  and Black-rumped Blue Monarch . However the best two birds took a long time to find . Firstly we followed a small track into the forest and made our way slowly and quietly through the undergrowth and crossing streams until we gained clear views of the elusive endemic the Sri Lankan Scaly Thrush . Secondly following advice from a local guide we retraced our steps and left the main forest following the call of our target bird high in the canopy . After much neck breaking scanning of the tree tops we finally had sight of the Red-faced Malkoha . After lunch we changed out plans to return to the Heritage Centre in search of the Sri Lankan Blue Magpie as our early morning visit was disrupted by a large group of school children . However there were still dozens of excited children around , then after an hour the heavens opened . Finally we did see a very bedraggled Blue a Magpie and Layard’s Squirrel . Early next morning we drove up to Martin’s Rest , one or the first specialised birding accommodation in the forest . Where we had breakfast on the balcony overlooking the forest . Just before breakfast we saw our final endemic bird , White-faced Starling . Thank to a Upali my guide I had now seen all the 34 endemic birds of Sri Lanka . After more birding we returned to the Heritage Centre and were rewarded with excellent close up views of the spectacular Sri Lankan Blue Magpie , plus Oriental Honey Buzzard and a beautiful Forget-me-not butterfly . Late afternoon after lunch we took a steep trek up a winding track in search of roosting owls . However after a strenuous climb we were unsuccessful but we did see a Brown-throated Needletail flying over . On our final morning we entered the forest for the last time and although we saw few new birds I did get clearer views and photographs of birds seen earlier , such as : Dark-fronted Babbler , Ashy-headed Laughing Thrush , Sri Lankan Crested Drongo , Spot -winged Ground Thrush , and one until now elusive bird Slaty-legged Crake . After a refreshing drink of tea with a local family we finally walked out of the forest . 3 days which I will never forget .","June 6, 2019",0.0,0.0

Wear the socks, don't be put off, it's worth it. You'll not go deep into the forest, the first part of any walk is along the path shared by locals, motorcycles and many many dogs. On the longer walks you go in a bit deeper but not far as it's necessary to protect primary rainforest like this. You will see: snakes, spiders, monkeys, giant squirrels, and lots of lizards. They will be pointed out to you and I believe will be in the same place day after day. You may see birds, but you will hear them and waterfalls.

Without his explanation to us about the trees and the animals around, the whole tour might turn out to be a sheer forest hiking. Also, the guides there in general have very sharp eyes and good sense of whereabouts of the animals and insects. Some real tiny lizards and frogs could hardly be seen because also of their camouflage. And on the other hand the birds or even the pink face leave eating macaques are shy from people.

Excuse for this long review though. The best time to visit this rain forest is during January - Mid of April. If you’re interested in birdwatching it’s better to start at 6.00 a.m (Opens at 6.00a.m) but as the birds fly up very high and tiny you’d need good cameras to capture them. If not for that starting at 8.00a.m would be fine where again you will hear bird tweets but hardly seen. Luckily I saw a few endemic birds although I started at 8 o’clock. There are various types of treks that you can take according to your wish. Treks for around 3 hrs, 5hrs and even longer ones with around 19km which takes almost a day (8a.m.-5p.m) There are 4 entrances to the forest from  different towns. I accessed through Mediripitiya, Deniyaya. The guides doesn’t necessarily have to be pre booked as they can be called near to the entrance. There is no particular guide fee but it’s better to tip them with a little more money. The vehicles can’t go up to the entrance, so you will have to take tuk tuks and the guides can be helpful in here. (Might cost around 250LKR for tuks and also walkable as it’s around a 1.5km) About the clothing; It’s up to you to wear either shorts or long pants but it’s said it’s better with short because any leaches or insects can be spotted easily. Good trekking or walking shoes are recommended as it would be better for walking while it’s slippery as well. Better to take some snacks and food along with you where you can sit and enjoy them during the trek and also enough water. So here I come to say what to actually expect. Starting with the entrance the ticket is a very small amount for both locals and foreigners which I assume is toooo low. You can see various types of endemic species and plants, birds, lizards, snails, snakes, butterflies, millipedes and little types of insects. There are 3 elephants and  all the kinds of leopards but are not seen as they do not come close to where the trek is done. The waterfalls are magnificent you can go up in there and enjoy a free fish therapy and also dip yourself in fresh water which is highly recommended. The walking path is where the people of other closer villages pass by so motor bikes are also crossed. The high trees and trekking paths are just too gorgeous to explain. You will feel the inner peace when you walk and feel the nature for sure. Leaches: The most concern of all. It’s not very harmful at the first place but you can hire leach socks (ask about it at the entrance)but as our guide said a packet of salt will do good enough. That is to apply the table salt on your shoes. I was very lucky to find no leach in my shoes or legs but it is mainly because it didn’t rain much on the previous days but if it rained there will be more leaches. If you’re too concerned apply some insect repellents as well. PS: Everyone can’t expect the same types of insects or snakes to be seen as it differ with the climate and other various factors. I would highly recommend this place if you are truly a nature lover.","January 7, 2019",0.0,0.0

Here's what happened to us and we had an organised driver, who I actually didn't always trust unfortunately. He tried to tell us we needed to find a guide prior to the entrance, so I gave up arguing and simply caught Tuk Tuk up to entrance. When we arrived I was wary, pretty sure it wasn't the official entrance so just played the game. The man who approached us wanted 2600SR per person, husband butted in and said yeh ok I just kept my trap shut at that point. Then we started walking off so I kept asking where is the official entrance I want a receipt. He kept saying it's up ahead, and yes we finally did get there. We then had to pay approx 550SR each entrance. I knew this was right but had to sought out the rest. I queried the lady at desk and said don't we pay for an official guide here after taking a photo of the entrance, she then looked blankly at our supposed guide then asked ME how much, I replied I'd read that it was 1000SR which she then agreed to. Well surprise surprise then an official guide materialised. You could then tell the difference the official guide had a Polo shirt with the appropriate logos and our so called guide had a T-shirt printed up to look identical. We did our 3hr walk to the waterfall and back, as we only wanted to do the short trek and we did have a great time for a few 1000 SR cheaper than they tried to fleece us and we gave him a tip. My warning is when you get dropped off at house at top hill continue walking down hill to official gate. We will never know if I didn't demand that we go to gate and buy a ticket whether we would have ended up on some random walk somewhere as I have read has happened to others.","January 7, 2019",0.0,0.0

Same with mosquitoes- according to my guide humans are not the preferred food so the mozzies dont bother you in so balanced an ecosysytem. What can you expect to see ? You see scorpions, a couple of snakes if your guide has keen eyes like mine, many lizards (including the kangaroo lizard) , many butterflies, a giant squirrel, some macaques and some giant millipedes.   Birds are best seen early in the morning so not great for daytrippers. Dont expect to see the leopards or elephants. They are here but you wont see them.

We paid an entrance fee which included the services of a forest guide too. He did not speak English but our guide was luckily able to translate. He pointed out wildlife; we saw a snake, monkey and various birds, pretty butterflies and others. The trek is 4 hours to the viewpoint at the top. Be warned though this is not a casual stroll through the forest! We rocked up with trainers and anoraks and thought we were fine. But there is a lot of climbing and clambering and it took us nearer 5 hours. It is very humid as you would expect. I struggled and didn’t quite make it to the top although the rest of the family did and enjoyed the view. Really hiking boots are required and DEFINITELY pay for leech socks! I didn’t know you could do this or I definitely would have done. We were plagued by leeches all the way round - I tucked my trousers into my socks - but the leeches ate through my (fairly robust sport socks) and my ankles / socks were bright red from the blood!! Not a pretty sight. Shocked the (well prepared) Chinese tourists! I ended up with 5 leech bites and we had to keep stopping to remove the leeches from INSIDE our shoes/ socks as well as outside. Ew. On the way back down we sprayed our shoes with mozzy repellent which seemed to help.  Do take plenty of water too - again we were ill prepared. An interesting experience but would have been much easier with the right equipment! There is a little shop you can buy a few welcome snacks/ drinks at the end. There are toilets but women - it’s just a hole in the ground :(. You make want to take an entire change of clothes if like me you sweat in the humidity!","August 18, 2018",0.0,0.0

Eventually we were advised by our taxi driver (Niron, owner of Unawatuna Tours) to hire a guide called Chaminda. Price was 5000 rp per person for our family of four, inclusive the park entrance fee of 1250 rp per person, for a full day trip (07:00 - 14:00, from our accomodation at 1 km from the park entrance). We agreed to meet Chaminda in the afternoon to discuss things further. Our accomodation (Sinharaja Forest Sanctuary - certainly advisable for a pleasant stay!) also advsed Chaminda without being informed by us about our previous arrangements; they were very enthousiastic about his qualities. In the reviews in this Tripadvisor topic, Chaminda’s name appeared once, also with good judgement. A couple that had made a trip with him on our arrival day was also quite pleased with him, only a bit set back because of the price (16000 rp for the two of them including entrance fee). After meeting him, we were convinced of his quality. The price seems fair enough in comparison with tourguide costs in other Sri Lanka parks. Obviously, cost per person decreases somewhat for a group of four compared to only two persons - the guide has to spend his full day in both cases, isn’t it. The next morning Chaminda picked us up at our hotel; he had already stored the packed breakfasts and lunches in his backpack and off we went. He immediately showed to have a keen eye for all kinds of creatures, large and small, and knew their names well (as a biologist, I was very keen on that aspect of his guidance). The first 4 km led along a track that was also used by local villagers, as this is their only way to go there. A new road is slowly being realized through difficult terrain south of the river bordering Sinharaja on the south, and hooefully will be completed in 2 years from now. The motorbikes were certainly there but kept a reasonable pace (the track hardly allows for speeding...). We then reached the park centre where we ate our breakfast and we were registered by a park ranger; entrance fees were paid. From there we went to first waterfall, and continued in easterly direction along a steep climb to a second fall. There we had lunch and had our feet being cared for by small fish (Garra or similar species: a free jungle spa experience). We returned to the park via another trail and continued along the main path back home. Total distance was 17 km (from 7 am till 2 pm). Leeches were hardly a problem, but we were lucky with hardly any rain so this may be the explanation. Wildlife was abundant: snakes, macaques (and purple-faced langurs heard, not seen). Grey hornbills, hand-sized spiders, large millipeds and various beautiful lizards. A beautiful experience of a primary and seemingly untouched piece of rainforest!

It's a world Heritage site. The forest is shared by the districts of Ratnapura, Galle and Matara. There are 3 official entrances, namely Veddagala (Kudawa),  Morning side and Pitadeniya (Mederipitiya).  The most popular of these is Kudawa that can be reached via Ratnapura - Nivitigala - Kalawana or Matugama (Dodangoda exit of Southern highway) - Agalawatte - Kalawana.  Alternatively, it can be reached via Horana -  Anguruwathota Kukuleganga - Kalawana. If you are coming from Udawalawa take Kahawatte - Nivitigala - Kalawana route. If you are coming down from the central Hills turn left at Thiruwanaketiya close to Ratnapura. The usual trek inside the jungle from the entrance to the research center is about 10km return. Almost anybody should be able to take this relatively easy trail. There are several other trails such as Mulawella, Sinhagala etc. Those are all longer and more difficult. Most bird and animal sightings are on the first trail. It rains to some part of this forest almost daily. Take caps/hats as a minimum precaution. You may even take an umbrella in the rainy season. Leeches are omnipresent. In my opinion sports shoes and denims are the best protection. You got to tuck the denim inside the socks. Despite all the precautions keep an eye on the leeches all the time and all the way. An experienced guide is an asset. He will show you endemic plant and animal species as you walk along. You can't take Polythene inside. Don't venture inside the jungle for fear of snake bites. Leopard also might post a threat. However, so far there have not been Leopard attacks. The two remaining elephants (July 2018)are always angry.  But their habitat is mainly in Rakwana region. When they roam inside the jungle for about 2 months every year in the Kudawa area the guides will not allow visitors to walk all the way in the trails. The forest is home to many beautiful species of endemic birds, butterflies, lizards etc. Blue Magpie and Trogon are two of the most beautiful birds. If you are lucky you might get a chance to see Frog Mouth - an elusive endemic nocturnal bird. They are usually found in male/female pairs perched at eye level inside the jungle during day time. The male and the female are quite different from each other - female being brownish and the male blackish /grayish. You are likely to see many snakes such as Green Pit Vipers, tree snakes etc. Keep your distance from vipers (and Cobra if you see one). Kangaroo lizard is a common site the male of the species being more colourful. Both the National bird of Sri Lanka, Sri Lanka Jungle Fowl and the National butterfly of Sri Lanka, Bird Wing can be found here. The bird is more heard than seen. The Butterfly is seen commonly in certain seasons. What Sinharaja has to offer you is immense. You should spend as much time as possible inside the forest to reap the fruits of visiting this heavenly place on earth.","July 13, 2018",0.0,0.0

We went with a nature guide who runs a guesthouse nearby (see other review).  The forest itself was a great experience but the wildlife was totally absent on my trip. I came back very disappointed and feel even more so when I look at the lovely pictures others have put up. I don't know what went wrong. The night before our walk, it rained a lot. The guide said this would lead to better sightings, but we kept walking without seeing any birds or animals. We went as far as the waterfall, then on the way back it started pouring with torrential rain, which was a great experience - it is a rain forest after all so the warm rain soaking you right through to the bones was unique and welcome. However, it made the chances of seeing any wildlife even smaller. We saw some centipedes, a couple of colourful lizards and finally towards the end of the walk after walking through rain for 2 hours, a green pit viper. That's all. Not one bird. That's our luck I suppose. All our other wildlife trips in Sri Lanka proved very lucky, except this one. But we got soaked with rain in a primary rainforest, so I'm not too unhappy. Oh, and the leeches were everywhere, despite salt on the shoes and socks. Obviously salt will get washed away when it rains. So use leech socks.","April 20, 2018",0.0,0.0

Sanjaya was presented as the Forest Reserve guide affiliated with Sinharaja Forest Sanctuary. We were told things are very organized in the area, impossible to hire another guide other than the one affiliated with your lodge. A system that opens the gate to monopolistic pricing strategy we were soon to find out. A walk of 5-7 hours ending at the Singahala mountain with me and my husband, was priced at 20.000 Rs, entrance fee included. In Sri Lanka normal wages are like 1000 to 2000 Rs/day. What followed was an awkward negociation ending in an agreement for a shorter track of 3-4 hours for 6000 Rs. Next day we started off early, he walked a very slow pace on a dirt road with much motorcycle traffic towards a building in the forrest. Arriving there he said he had to buy the entry tickets so we handed him the 6000 Rs but didn't see him actually purchase anything. We took some pictures on what I think are pricing indications for guided tours (pic attached). From there to the waterfall was a more quiet stroll, we encountered many other guides with tourists all heading to the waterfall. So the walk could be done by any 70 year person.  After this first waterfall he asked if we wanted to return to the lodge. I had heared about an other waterfall with little fish that nibble at the corn on your feet. He didn't seem too pleased. We continued steep up the mountain which was very much OK for us. No further information on the surroundings from that point on. On the way back the guide started to limp, a knee injury it seemed. He wanted to take a break so we waited a while. Later on he wanted to and have a drink but we had lunch ordered at the lodge. It came accross as looking for opportunity to ask for more money. Near the end  I asked for the entrance tickets which he could not produce. He said he would get them later that afternoon and bring them to our lodge. We got some tickets but these seemed old and tampered with (pic included). I would still advise to visit the Sinharaja Forest Reserve although we did not have the best experience. Think the Forest Reserve has to put some things in order to avoid malpractice. Tourists are willing to pay for Reserve entrance, money to be used to preserve the Forest Reserve.

Time it properly as the rains can be extremely difficult to explore the terrain. Leech Protection is vital unless it’s a very dry season. I’ve found the Leech Socks for sale at the Sinharaja Entrance Ticket Office (Rs. 350/- per pair) are very good at leech protection.  Time the journey properly and we found the Highway- Matugama-Kalawana Route to be the easiest and the quickest. We reached the entrance under 2.5hrs without a major rush. Bird’s Paradise and Martin’s Lodge are recommendable accommodation options. There are multiple trails inside Sinharaja and except Sinhagala Trail others can be managed in one day quite easily. You’d probably need a full day to do the Sinhagala Trail. Do remain silent inside the forest in order not to disturb the wildlife.  pls. enjoy her beauty and leave her in peace without destroying the most precious thing we have. Don’t break plants or flowers or try to bring them home. Most of these plants won’t grow in your garden. So please enjoy them where they are.The road from Kalawana to Kudawa is largely completed except at a few places so you wouldn’t have trouble getting there in any vehicle. Pitakele Doovili Ella is about 2-3km from the Sinharaja Entrance. However when you are coming from Kalawana, there’s a junction just passing a metal bridge before the Sinharaja Gate. You have to then take the right and the first left uphill concrete paved path. On this road travel for about 1.5-2km until the interlock stones paved stretch of the road and you have to get downhill to the river to view the waterfall.

This forest has been rescued from and attempted mass logging in late 1970's, when a dedicated group of scientist  mounted a scientifically informed campaign.  Since then it has been designated as a Man And Biosphere reserve as well as a world nature heritage site. Today it is the largest intact tract of lowland rainforest in Sri Lanka, which is home to numerous endemic tree, bird and other species. It is considered to be a significant hot spot of global biodiversity and a keystone in evolution. The majestic towering trees, many clear and pure brooks, hundreds of bird species, and the winding paths within this forest are simply impressive.  Guided hikes are included in the modest entrance fee. These guides are employees of the forest dept, and appear to be very well informed.

You can expect to fill your lungs with super positive oxygen and good energy in the green flora and fauna. Best with a small group guided by the biologist or a ecologist. A bird expert can help you spot more than 20 species of birds within a 4-5 hour trek. Do not worry about leeches. If you worry too much, you get easily attacked. Do not recommend wearing leech socks. It make them clip up to upper parts of your body. Always wear slippers and shorts. Cary a small umbrella if you don't like to get wet or carry camera gear. I carry 200-500mm lens, which is heavy and big. So, I carry an umbrella. it is easier than wearing rain coats. Rain coat is ok for kids and hands free travelers. Best feeling is when you get wet in the rain, because that water is so pure and has medicinal value too as they filter down from the green canopy above. Select week days as there is less school children and less noise. Noise is distracting birds and you will not have a good time bird watching. Enter early morning by 7am and try to be inside till around 3-4pm, those are the peak times which you can watch flocks.

You reach a point where you can’t drive anymore so you park and take a tuktuk to the start of the hike. I did the 4 and a half hour trek and I enjoyed every bit of it. You don’t see a ton of wildlife but the trek itself is very refreshing for the soul. In short, if you’re looking for a nice hike that isn’t too far from the south west, this is the best one. Make sure you check out the two waterfalls and go for a swim if you can, it’s super clean and refreshing. I would say that this is at a beginner level so if you’re in good shape you shouldn’t have a problem finishing this trail. They have a 24 km option which I might do the next time I come, that one is supposedly quite difficult as it involves a lot of climbing. Lastly, on the topic of leeches, I wore long pants and tucked my socks in so I didn’t have a problem but I highly recommend that you come prepared because those things are pretty nasty as my guide had a few on his legs.

It is home to a myriad of wonderful birds, plants and animals - but be prepared that you will see just a small amount of what is here. Our guide was very knowledgeable, finding Sri Lanka Frogmouth for us when the rain had begun and all the birds had taken cover, but the visit is a walk out to the research centre then back along the same route - limiting the amount of ground that you cover, unless you take the more challenging path up to the cave.. In November it is usual for the rain to come from late morning for a few hours, and expect it to be heavy, so my advice would be to go first thing in the morning, before the rain so that there are more birds, animals and insects in view. The best place to see birds is in the clearings - there aren't so many of these so take your time when you find one and wait a while at these places hoping for a flock to pass through. It is advisable to take an umbrella. There are also leeches. To limit how much these little nasties get on to you tuck top/shirt into trousers, trouser bottoms into socks, then use leech socks if available - although I and my husband were using waterproof sealskinz socks and these were actually more effect than the leech socks that our guide used. Take alcohol wipes, in case any manage to attach. They tend to march on to potential hosts from the ground so keep laces short, tuck into tongue of boots/shoes if possible. Keep checking clothing for leeches - amazing how fast they move - and they show up more on light coloured clothes.","December 13, 2017",0.0,0.0

Make sure you bring a cigarette (easiest) or take several handfuls of salt as a teaspoons will not do the trick once a leech has latched on. This was my second only guided trip in 45 years of travel (first being enforced years back in PR China) and though I can manage snakes,poisonous spiders and rats, I am not so great with leeches. Out of consideration for the guide, I kept my eyes on the treetops until we reached a tiny store where someone had a ""beedie"". Then another helpful individual informed us that leeches often hbernate in large balls high in the trees and drop onto warm blooded creatures passing by underneath. I have since asked several other experienced walkers in Sri Lanka to be told that this is true. Don't be put off; just be prepared. Another tip, if you are taken to the Buddhist retreat be prepared for the Austrian monk to insult you if you are (a) Christian (b) Australian or (c) polite. He does, however have a recipe for a kind of herbal infusion which is effective against high blood sugar.

It is possible to do the journey by public buses but would have involved changing bus and an extra couple of hours so we decided a car was worth the extra money. The journey took 2.5 hours and 12,000 rps return. Entry to the reserve is 600 rps and I would definitely recommend getting a guide (1000 rps per person) otherwise you will miss all the wildlife. Our guide was really great, picking up snakes and lizards for us and pointing out lots of insects, different trees and bushes etc. We saw green pit vipers, giant millipedes, lizards, huge spiders. He also took us to an amazing waterfall that you can swim in and jump off the rocks into the pool if you want to - way too high for me! We were finished by about 1pm. One thing to note is there are loads of leeches!!  So wear trainers, long trousers and socks to tuck your trousers into. A t shirt is fine though. Our guide also bought salt to rub onto our shoes and ankles as this apparently stops them from leeching on. They are small but pretty gross!

We consider ourselves fortunate to witness the endemic butterflies, birds, animals, insects, ferns, reptiles as well as many crystal clear ponds and flowing streams.  The trees were tall over 120 feet, what you would expect to see in a rainforest.  Walking along the path was an experience of wonderful sights and sounds of birds, animals and flowing waters.  Those were two days we lived with nature.  The forest is undisturbed and well conserved. One has to be mindful of leaches and it is best to wear leach proof socks and spray soap or Dettol to deter them.  The best time for travel is between December to April.

You need to pay entrance and take a guide to get in. So far so good. But once you entered this 'pristine' rain forrest every 5 minutes you need to jump out of the way for a motorbike! The explanation is that locals have the right to drive through this 'pristine' rain forrest.  Here and there there are cables and of course litter. Basically this is a tourist death trap, where you are milked by your local guide, selling you unwanted bottles of water, lunch boxes etc. You finally end up at a river with a waterfall where hundreds of other tourists take a swim and dump their litter. The unesco definitely needs to come and take a look here and make some improvements as indeed this forrest is beautiful but everything but pristine. Note: this trip is not intended for the weak of health the path is long (approximately 16km) and dangerous/slippery at places, especially when it is wet (it is a rain forrest after all) also prepare for bugs and leeches.

By car it should cost no more than 7,000 LKR there and back, and it is best to take a large vehicle due to the poorly constructed roads. Should you wish to have a guided tour (which I would highly recommend), they should not ask for more than 3000-5000 LKR which covers entrance fee, the tuk tuk ride to the beginning of the rainforest and the guided tour itself.  Our guide (forgive me but I have forgotten his name) was absolutely brilliant – charming, knowledgeable and great with a camera. It is advisable to go earlier in the morning if one wishes to see lots of animals. Nevertheless, our guide managed to show us vipers, spiders, monkeys etc. even during the late afternoon.

Tight white or light colour socks would b preferable as u can spot easily the leeches of they get on to u. 3. Take citronella spray or oil from a shop as it helps u to take the leech off. 4. Apply siddalepa on your feet and leg before u do the trekking. And take salt. 5. Leech socks are fine. 6. Try not to think too much about leeches otherwise u will not enjoy the trek.

It is vital to take the highway from Colombo or face traffic which could lengthen the journey to anywhere between 4 to 6  hours. Furthermore, it is extremely important to bring along a pair of 'leech socks' in order to hike the forest with ease. These socks are sold at the souvenir shop at the entrance. Loved every moment in the forest. Such a feeling to breathe in that fresh unpolluted air inside the forest with only the sounds of water falls, birds and the occasional monkeys resonating around the surrounding. The guides are extremely educated on the surrounding and its inhabitants. We came across monkeys, varied types of butterflies, birds, fishes and lizards most of which were endemic to the beautiful island of Sri Lanka. Further down we found a beautiful little zen like area where the water flows gently from the main water fall that is in the area.

We discovered that they don't just live in water and will drop from trees or leaves onto to the ground or you if they sense a chance at a blood meal - so put full covering on legs and top.   If you do get bitten it is harmless just a nibble pain and then you will bleed for a while but stops - you will not die :) (7) We saw snakes, reptiles, monkeys, spiders, all sorts so very worthwhile.

He didn't check with us, if we had enough water, the right clothes and when we came across a snake that be hadn't spotted before he got really worried and has quite a panicky look on his face.

The way was maybe too challenging to enjoy the scenery and you had to watch your every step, make sure you don't get sucked dry by the leeches when you stopped.

The paths are made partially of cement slabs and rocks, and are well market throughout. Some parts are not suitable for disabled people, but good for children. The sight of elephant tracks (and dung) make it exciting for the children. If you use a guide, don’t expect great naturalist or linguistic skills, but they have a trained eye for interesting plants and invertebrates. You will struggle, however, to find a single leech or mosquito. This is the rainy season, and the most experienced guides walked in shorts and flip-flops, which is telling. Swimming is safe. The paths inside the park are crossed daily by hundreds of local people, often in motorbikes, and certainly not accompanied by guides. In addition to all the visitors, this makes it a crowded park, particularly in the paths close to the entrances. The entrance ticket to the park costs now about Rs 600. One should not have to pay more than that for a guide (per adult). This is already a bit higher than the Sri Lankan tourists in small groups pay for a guide. The best strategy is to sit in a restaurant by the park entrance, enjoy a beer or an excellent curry, and negotiate the price with one of the local villagers that are, so-called, certified guides. The first offer you get may be 5 times higher than the park fee, which is obviously a swindle. Take it easy, prices will come down. But, remember that by 17:30 it starts to get dark.

About 2.5 hours so a reasonable trek to the southern entrance outside Deniyaya. The road ends and you are in a very small village where tuk Tuks are there to take you up the bumpy trail to the Forest office where you buy your tickets (560 lkr each).  Tuk tuk was 250 lkr each way.  we were told in the village that the guides all had to be hired in village, our driver seemed sceptical but nonetheless we went ahead with a ""guide"".   On reflection I don't believe he was a true ""guide"" as on the trail we noted other guys with official polo shirts, rucksacks, and binoculars...  Our guide was in tracksuit bottoms with a bottle of 7-up.  My fears were confirmed when his initial quote for the 3 hour walk was 4600 lkr, rather more than the 2000 lkr I was told  to expect.  Some haggling later we were at 2500 for 3 hour trek and set to go.   It started off promisingly ...  Tiny luminous green snake, massive millipede, rhino fly all spotted in a few minutes, then a couple of lizards...   But then things literally dried up and we diverted off to the track to the conservation centre for 10 minutes sit down, Nothing there apart from some faded pictures...  Then after a total of a 1 hour slow walking on a very, very well trodden path (avoiding locals on motorbikes as mentioned in other posts regarding this southern entrance) we arrived at a picturesque, but hardly awe inspiring waterfall, where we sat for another 10mins before a brisk walk back down the same path and back to base.. Avoiding those motorbikes again.  Luckily we saw a serpent eagle high up in a tree on the way back or else it would have been a zero spot rapid trek back - total time start to finish 2 hours 10 and we only made it to first waterfall.  Should have asked for trip to 2nd waterfall instead of stating a time.  Although, apparently, you do have to wade to get to the second. So in summary I would have to agree with earlier posts about this southern entrance and say that it is spoiled by the motorbikes which must scare off the timid wildlife and please make sure you get a proper ""guide"" with binoculars and who has time and inclination to be able to look for and find whatever wildlife does stay close to the main route. To be fair and for reference we hit the trail at 9am and that may well have been too late to see the bulk of the wildlife...  So my advice would be go to the north entrance, go early, get an official guide with binoculars and spend more than 3 hours :-)","August 2, 2016",0.0,0.0

It's not easily accessible as it's at least a couple hours drive from any civilized accommodation but once you get there it's a great activity for a full day. You have to get a tuk tuk from a nearby village to get to the park. There are multiple waterfalls and interesting trees around. The water is pretty nice if you like to swim in rivers or lakes. The trek isn't very demanding and almost anyone can handle it. Since it's a rainforest there's a lot of humidity and camping in the forest could be quite a wet activity. There are various snakes and spiders around so if you are specifically interested in them this is a nice place to find many.

For birdwatching the Northern part seems where most people head, but it's probably more difficult getting there than the Southern entrance. This post is about the Northern side only. Choices of accommodation is limited and expensive in comparison to the rest of Sri Lanka. You really need 2 days minimum or 1 overnight stay close by to make it worthwhile, a day-trip is not realistic in my opinion. Taking a guide is compulsory Rs1000 + Rs 650 pp entrance fee. The road up to the Ticket Office and parking area is tarmac & accessible to any vehicle. At the Ticket Office you pay your fees, sign the foreign visitors book and get your guide. The guides are all very experienced and know their stuff so don't worry. You then have to walk to the actual park entrance about 2 km uphill along the Park Road (pedestrian only) that goes through forest. (Some people get ferried uphill by arranged jeep, but this is back on a completely different track - Martin's Rd - and it's not very pleasant + expensive.) See the map on my photo uploads - the one in Google maps is completely incorrect. Once you reach the Entrance Office, they will sign you in and let you through. The main trail is very broad and fairly flat with resting shelters and toilets along the way. You are not ""trekking"" through the jungle. It's more like an easy stroll really. In March the forest was very dry with not a single leech in sight either. The main trail from the Entrance Office leads to a Rangers Station a few kilometres further on but there are other smaller side trails too. I was very content walking the main trail at a slow pace to spot as many things as we could, finding a feeding flock of birds is brilliant and you can easily spend an hour rooted in one spot trying to pick out different species. I found the fact that none of the guides use binoculars amazing! Note for birders - If you have spare time walk the access road between the Ticket Office and Kudawa Bridge below.

Sinharaja is for those who are serious about bird-watching are prepared to do a fair bit of walking and are equipped with good binoculars and leech socks. Our naturalist guide was very knowledgeable and was able to spot and identify birds quickly. I would recommend an early arrival around 7am because it seems they run out of guides and Jeeps. Having obtained our tickets and found the naturalist guide, we had to wait 20 minutes or so for a Jeep (even at 7am). This took us up the hill on an extremely rough road (15 minutes) and left us with the naturalist guide to walk through the reserve. It would be possible to walk up the hill but it would take a long time to get to the heart of the reserve. After some 2 - 3 hours, the naturalist guide suggested we go to the “village area” in a Jeep where he reckoned we could see a number of birds not previously seen. So we waited 20 minutes or so for another Jeep and started back down the hill. Halfway down, we met the original Jeep coming up and changed vehicle. At the bottom we met our chauffeur/guide who had taken us to the reserve and he explained that if we took the Jeep to the “village”, which it appeared was outside the park area, it would cost extra (some 3500 rupees). He explained that what we had paid for was one Jeep trip up the hill and down again. We declined the Jeep but the chauffeur/guide took us in the car as far as he could and we agreed to walk the rest with the naturalist guide. We never really reconciled whether the naturalist guide was simply trying to get us the best bird-watching experience and see the most interesting birds, or whether he was trying to rip us off by luring us into extra charges. I don’t know what our agent in Sri Lanka expected and had paid for the package that we had but, from the contract we were sent, I had expected that the Jeep and naturalist guide would be at our disposal for the day.

We saw a snake, snails, lizards, monkeys, but we did not see any birds. I wanted to take photographs about some beautiful birds, but they did not come.

I really enjoyed our stay here, it's a tourist location but not touristy. The relatively small number of guests gives it a country house hotel feel as we had conversations with a number of other residents. The accommodation is in T shaped metal buildings, they are large enough for two with good showers, bed and settee. They also have a number of UK sockets, we also had an extension lead. Interestingly we were able to sleep with the windows open as there does not seem to be any flying biting creatures at all. Breakfast and dinner were both good, although there is only a choice of two main courses for the 5 course dinner. Our travel agent said they do not serve alcohol which is not true. The WIFI is a little erratic but it did not prevent me from doing everything I wanted to do online. The high spots are the very relaxed walks with the personable and knowledgeable guides. We did 3 in one day the 6.30 am bird watching 3.3 miles along a road, the rainforest walk around 3 hours over reasonably easy ground and the waterfall walk somewhat steeper. On the latter walk one can paddle in the water and let the fish clear any dead skin of your feet. The walks are free and there is nothing to stop you going on the same one twice. There was an evening walk on offer as well. As others have said leech socks are provided I wore them on the second walk but not on the last one when I had shorts and crocs on. The journey to the hotel is 'interesting' as it's pretty steep and narrow, our driver had no problems but others did especially if it was the first time they had done it.","February 3, 2016",0.0,0.0

Maybe the guides vary, but ours had good English, sharp eyes, and an extensive knowledge of all the flora and fauna. We saw so many snakes that we have never wanted to put our hands or feet down on anything but the path ever again in Sri Lanka  (we love reptiles and insects) and plenty of leeches so, if possible, where longer socks so you could talk your pants in. The guy gave us all to put on her shoes and socks but my daughter and I had short socks and I had waffle fabric shoes so the salt just went into my shoes.  BTW If you do get a leech, the current science recommendation is to just pry it loose with your fingernail. At the second waterfall you can swim and there are also lots of fish. If you have snorkeling equipment, take it! Or maybe just take a mask and snorkel or even goggles. If you do swim to the waterfall, don't just strike out for it. Facing the waterfall, go along the rocks in shallow water to your right and then swim to the back wall of the pool. Then there is not so much current and even a weaker swimmer can get under the waterfall.

Sinharaja is now recognised as a Unesco World Heritage site and an Endemic Bird Area by Birdlife International. The flocking behaviour of birds in Sinharaja is the most intensively studied in the world. Indeed find a flock and you may well see a decent number of Sri Lanka's 33 (currently, will increase soon) birds, including Ceylon Crested Drongo, White-backed Starling, Sri Lankan Scimitar-babbler and Ceylon Rufous Babbler. Sinharaja also has a very good site for Ceylon Scaly Thrush which was split into a separate species after my previous visit. There are also a number of very good guides and rangers who can spot roosting nightbirds including Ceylon Frogmouth and most crucially Serendip Scops-owl, the latter only described to science as recently as 2003 (I think).

How the Sinharaja rain forest acquired its name has many stories with different versions. However none has been proved scientifically, but still Falk lore & legends are always interesting and catch our attention. It gives us a mixed feeling of creep, inquisitiveness and past gloriousness. Sinharaja Forest myths are lost in the mists of legend and lore. Its name, literally meaning lion (sinha ) king (raja ).Both the forest and the Sinhalese people derive their names from the Sinhalese word ""Sinha"" – the Lion, and according to legend, sinhalese race is the result of the union between a princess and a mighty lion who lived in the forest. Perhaps it also refers to the people of the legendary 'lion-race' of Sri Lanka, or to the home of a legendary lion of Sri Lanka. Some legends state that in the Sinharaja forest lived a mighty lion that ruled the area brought dread in to the hearts of the villagers. Another says that the “Sinharaja Adaviya” meaning the Sinharaja forest is said to have been the royal territory belonging to the ancient Kings of Sri Lanka. Sinharajas habitat comprises of four main stratums. They are: Canopy, Sub canopy, Under storey and Ground flora. These play a vital role in keeping together the relationship between flora and fauna, its distribution and sustainability. Trees that grow with a height of 30-45m are considered as canopy. They absorb sunlight freely and grow to be giants. Average diameter reaches up to 5m (16feet).  Sub canopy group to block the sunlight from falling below. They grow up to a height of 25-30m and join hands with each other to create a layer like canopy. Under storey consists of trees with heights up to 20-25m and has a horizontal growth pattern. Take usage of the available space. Ground flora has very little opportunity to absorb sun light so they have the survival technique to grow with minimum supply of sunlight. Mostly ferns and shrubs belong to this category. Other than these major categories there are epiphytes that grow on the trunks of trees, climbers which are vines that grow up and around the trees searching for sun light and parasites that grows on trees and nourished by trees. Different types of fungi also grow in abundance. Nature rivulet emerging from the forest of Sinharaja is a common sight. Over the wooded area with crystal clear water draining into various ways is truly breathtaking. Sinharaja forest plays a vital role in maintaining the continuous supply of water. These rivulets found within the forest, feed the rivers like Kalu Ganga and Gin Ganga. The vegetation within the reserve can be categorized into three main types: the lower slopes and valleys (150 - 600 meters), middle slopes (600 - 1000 meters) and the upper slopes and ridges (above 1,000 meters)The lower slopes and valleys have trees like “hora, bu hora” as the dominant canopy trees. On the middle slopes there are trees like Batu Na, Diya Na and Dun. In the upper slopes and ridges, the tree size decreases. Among the large trees of the canopy, columnar tree boles are an abundant sight. These are supported by plank buttress roots, a common characteristic of large rain forest trees. The total vegetation density of the forest has been estimated to be around 240,000 individuals per hectare. Forest gaps occur randomly and are caused by natural phenomena such as the death of large trees or the uprooting by the wind. In these gaps when the light starts to reach the ground, growth rate of saplings and other vegetation increase vigorously and forms impenetrable thickets. Bio Diversity of Sinharaja is unique and among the richest in the world. Many researches have been carried out and are being done up to date. Even today new species of plants and animals are discovered. Sinharaja has typical tropical lowland rain forest or tropical wet evergreen forest bio diversity. In the Sinharaja, floristic studies revealed the presence of many endemic floras. Sinharaja has many trees with high medicinal value. E.g. Venival, Godapara, Keena, Wanaraja, Iru raja etc are used to cure tetanus, joint breaks and sprains, snake bites. Insect trapper (Badura) and wanaraja are plants that can be observed in Sinharaja, famous for the insect trapping mechanism and medicinal qualities. The reserve is famous as a house of Orchids. They are spread throughout the reserve with their graceful beauty adding a touch of elegance to the reserve. The reserve is famous for endemic birds; it is the ideal place for ornithologists and bird watchers to study about feeding flocks. Almost all bird watchers and bird lovers visit Sinharaja to study about these endemic and migrant birds where very little resources are needed. In Sinharaja during an observation of a bird flock, one can observe about 30-50 birds belonging to different species. Capturing the perfect moment of a flock is truly challenging but rewarding too.  These flocks give life to the forest with their noise and movements.  Feeding flocks of Sinharaja are the most studied group in the world. So what is a flock? A flock can be described as two or more species moving in the same direction. A feeding flock means a one with movements associated with feeding. They can sometimes be mixed flocks. E.g. birds with squirrels.The most frequent species in the flocks were the Orange-billed Babbler and the Great Crested Drongo. Some of the rare and attractive endemic bird species in Sinharaja are Sri Lanka Red-Faced Malkoha, Sri Lanka Magpie, Sri Lanka Spur- Fowl, Sri Lanka Ashy-Headed Laughing Thrush, Sri Lankan White Faced Starling, Green Billed Cockle, Serendib Scope Owl. Sinharaja possess the perfect environment for amphibians; nature rivulets, wet soil, humidity, constant rains make it the ideal place for their habitat.  Many species of tree frogs can be found in Sinharaja and other Lowland rain forests of Sri Lanka and most of them are endemic and rare. Some were recently discovered and still there are many researches done on this field. Some of the rare and endemic frog species recorded only in Sinharaja from the world. Among the reptiles Green Garden Lizard, Common Garden Lizard and endemic Kangaroo Lizards are common. With a little luck Hump Nosed Lizard is the largest in the island and one of the most attractive lizards one will observe in Sinharaja. Three lizard species are of most important to Sinharaja. Two are recorded only in the morning side of the reserve and the world; they are, Eartleny Horn Lizard and Karus Horn Lizard. The Rough Horn Lizard is recorded only in Sinharaja and other wet lowland rain forests. Among the snakes The Green Pit Viper is endemic and Hump-nosed Viper, green vine snake are commonly found in this forest. Blossom krait is one of the few rare snakes recorded in lowland rain forests. Natures flying fairies; the butterflies bring Sinharaja vivid beauty that transfers the mysteriousness of the jungle to a decorative fantasy. Ceylon Bird Wing, Sri Lankan Tree Nymph Sri Lankan Blue Oak-leaf and Ceylon Rose are some endemic and rare attractive butterflies. Blue Mormon, Clipper,, Commander, Tale-jay, Common Mormon, Common Rose are some beautiful and large butterflies commonly found in the reserve. Sometimes Ceylon Rose and Oak-leaf may not appear as much as the others. Sambhur, the Mouse deer and barking deer are commonly found within the reserve. Leopards and fishing cat are very seldom sighted, purple - faced Leaf Monkey and giant squirrels also commonly observed. Red slender Loris, little ring civet cat, common farm civet cat, flying squirrel, are some nocturnal mammals. In Sri Lanka, wilderness areas have long been subject to the activities of man, and Sinharaja is no exception. There are many villages scattered around the reserve. Villagers in these areas produce jaggery. Although the palm is not deliberately planted by the villagers, seedlings which come up naturally tended and looked after. Tapping of trees within the forest is controlled by the Forest Department. Another source of income for the villagers is the manufacture of baskets and other woven products made of “wewal and bamboo”. The villagers also exploit other plant products. The fuel used by the villagers for cooking, making jaggery is firewood gathered from the forest. The villagers also collect and sell products from a number of plants like dried cardamom, a spice sold at a very high price. Resin, from the trunk of “Kekuna” is used as water proofing agent. Numerous plants used in the ""Ayurvedic"" medicine are also collected and sold by the villagers. The stem of “Weniwel” is a fine example. Timber for house construction is also obtained from trees in and around the Reserve. It is advisable that those who visit the forest be sensitive to the need to conserve it. Create awareness to protect Sinharaja and other rain forests. It is our duty and responsibility as nature lovers. Development of buffer zones can contribute a lot in conserving not only Sinharaja but other forest reserves as well. Construction of hotels and constructions of roads over the protected areas will result in irrecoverable damages. This unique green patch has taken Sri Lanka to the top list of bio diversity rich countries and boosts Sri Lankas tourism and eco tourism. People from all over the world visit Sri Lanka to study, research and enjoy these magical spots and has amazed many wild life and eco experts around the globe. Sinharaja, a tropical virgin rain forest is undoubtedly the centre of forest attraction!","November 12, 2015",0.0,0.0

We spent about 4.5 hours there and could not get there earlier than 10:30am (the full drive from Colombo took about  3.5 hours plus a half-hour stop) so we were only able to do the ""short"" loop of about 6km.  We took a tuk-tuk from the main road, arranged by our guide/driver, to a small cafe from whence we hiked to the ticket office and then into the rain forest. This is Sri Lanka's last remaining virgin forest and is a UNESCO world heritage site. Because we arrived in the middle of the day we did not get to see the full range of bird or animal life  because their natural activity is limited in the middle of the day; nonethless we heard their calls, which our naturalist often identified for us (hornbill, monkeys, etc.). One of the reasons we loved this hike was because of our naturalist (you cannot hike unaccompanied in the forest both because the government naturally wants to protect the fragile ecosystem but also likely because there are some poisonous snakes around), Sanjaya. He lives in the local village of about fifty families and has extensive knowledge of both the plants and animals at Sinharaja. He was eager to show us (at our request) many of the snakes--including a green pit viper and a bronze back--and reptiles including a couple of hump-nosed lizards and kangaroo lizards. We also saw large milipedes, a giant squirrel at close range, some large fish and a few other things. It was instantly obvious that Sanjaya knows every leaf, twig, nook and cranny of this forest and likewise knew exactly where to look for each kind of creature we wanted to see.  He also pointed out giant vines, wild cinnamon and some other unusual plants, some used for Ayurvedic medicine. Sanjaya was very conscientious and careful, always keeping an eye on our nine-year-old daughter, holding her hand at more difficult points in the hike, carrying her bag when she got too tired, warning us when we should keep our distance from a snake/riverbank/motorbike, etc. The hike was virtually flat and the only challenge was sometimes navigating major tree roots or uneven terrain. Some other reviews mentioned perilous leeches. We saw two miniscule ones, the size of inchworms, between four of us, but that was it the whole time. It was a dry day when we were there so it may have affected things. The short hike does involve crossing a river in order to get to a beautiful waterfall and swimming hole.

A two and a half hour trip from Mirissa most in darkness to get there at dawn. At the village it was 2280 rupees for us as a couple plus 2000 for the Guide (variously Freddie or Prandi who allegedly had worked there for 5 years and was abysmal-and I am being kind), and then 800rupees for the tuk-tuk to carry you from the village to the restaurant at the edge of the Rainforest itself. In fairness it was a diabolical track but are you going to refuse have travelled for probably hours and hours to get there. You are pressed to order a meal and the indifferent breakfast for 2 was more expensive than we would pay in Spain at our coastal resort for a full English breakfast. On to the rainforest experience and what an experience it was as we constantly had to quit the path in order to avoid being flattened by motorcycles and scooters. You see the track runs between 2 villages and is used for foot and cycle traffic. Then again there were the pedestrians although for the most part they were all smiles and 'good-mornings'  to which we replied in good part. So what did we see-Birds-ZERO, mammals-Zero, 6 Spiders, a small snake that crawled through the leaf litter-a whole 3cm long, a 5cm green tree snake, a chameleon and a kangaroo jumping lizard. And that was it. We have seen more wildlife in our hotel garden in Weligama including a 2m Monitor, a Mongoose, and Indian Cobra (which was duly collected by the snake man), and umpteen lizards. We arrived at the bridge some 3km on thinking we would get to the waterfall! Wrong again, you have to parallel the course of the river and then wade across. I ask you-shouldn't we have been warned. No the guide just wanted to shoot through because of course as soon as he had got rid of us he was then free to inveigle another punter to part with his/her hard earned money. At the bridge I spent some time talking to a local villager who said that the whole thing was nothing but a scam. The local fauna is just not in evidence due to the nature of the current disturbance and that anyone wanting to see the real Sinharaja and its wildlife should enter from the north where the fauna is much more acclimated to human intrusion. I know this seems somewhat contradictory but perhaps he meant that there were no noisy 2 wheelers shrieking by every 5 minutes or so. The pace set by the Guide was anything but conducive to studying nature and you had to keep your head down to avoid slipping and tripping. No Leeches. In conclusion, and as a world traveller of 40 years plus a thoroughly negative experience although possibly less so to the uninitiated and ON A GOOD DAY. Whatever you do avoid this entrance and state this to your Tour Company.","April 17, 2015",0.0,0.0

Although we saw most of the animals we were expecting the 3 hour return trip to the waterfall didn't  live up to expectations. We had expected to be on a trail in the wilderness jungle. Instead we had a pleasant walk alongside the river on a well defined path to the waterfall. The problem was that this path connects 2 villages and is used by motor bikes as a short cut. So instead of peace and quiet we were having to step aside as motor bikes sped past us. So if you fancy a nice guided walk, see some wildlife and a swim by a waterfall then this is good for you but if you're expecting wilderness it is not worth the time out of your holiday.","February 12, 2015",0.0,0.0

Add to that the presence of leeches and poisonous snakes.  If you go, be sure to purchase the cinnamon oil from the fellow selling it at the entrance.  We heard however he may not always be there or some visitors might not realize what he is selling and rush by him.  We took what we were told by our guide is the normal hike but he did not mention that to get to the falls we would have to wade through the stream with water evidently thigh high.

Nevertheless, we had a very interesting visit and saw chameleons, a pit viper, a green snake (can't remember the name), pitcher plants and various birds. We were lucky to spot a group of laughing thrushes just inches from our feet and a bulbul just above our heads.  We also spotted an eagle, but it was not easy to see the birds, so a good pair of binoculars would be handy to take.  We solved the problem of leeches by applying tiger balm to our shoes before we started.  There is a small stall on the way to the reserve with general items and our own guide advised us to buy the balm.

When we arrived he was nowhere to be found, I borrowed a phone and called the driver who said he had no knowledge of our party and he was in another part of the port and he would phone the company and would get back to me which he did a few minutes later. When he phoned he said he did not have room for 4 passengers so I phoned the company and got no answer so we hired another vehicle. About 45 minutes after we were supposed to be met I get a phone call saying that they had a different driver waiting for us but as we were already in Colombo with limited time available so we would continue and asked the company to let the driver know. When I got back I received an email claiming falsely that I had been told by email to go to a different terminal 2 Km away as the driver was not allowed into the passenger disembarkation area and that I would be considered to be a ""no show. I suggested that under the circumstances that a refund was in order and requested that $50 be returned, this suggestion caused another email to be sent and I was told that ""company policy"" did not allow for refunds. Moral, buyer beware. If you are looking for a city tour and are arriving by cruise ship, there are plenty of cars and vans to choose from, we finished up in a 7 seater air conditioned van with a knowledgeable driver who spoke excellent English for $20 an hour, less money less hassle.

It takes 2 hours to get there, we came around 9:00 and the guide was ready for us. We had a best guide (I am really sorry i cant remember the name), he has been doing a guide there for 6 years, he was able to point at the snakes in the bushes, grab them etc. We started at the restaurant, where you can have some drinks or homemade curries. The guide asked us, how long we want to walk and based on this he planned the way. The journey to the waterfall and back was 3 hours of very slow walk. We saw all different types of animals, 3 different snakes, spiders, chameleons, monkeys, varans, multipedes etc. Do not expect too see interesting flowers, it is a jungle and it is more about the fauna. Practical info: Clothes - would recommmend full shoes, high socks, long pants. There are leeches everywhere, so the guide will put you trousers to the socks, wet your shoes and cover them with a salt. If you are coming in the shorts and flip flops, the guide will put a special repelent on your feet and legs to prevent from the leeches. Even if they do this, the leeches can stick on you. Repelents - good to have good insect repelent Food and drinks - there is a very nice restaurant at the beginning, you can order curries before the jungle trail and they will have it ready for you after you end it (prices are higher) Price - we paid 11 000 rupies for the return journey from Unawatuna and 5000 rupies for the entrance and guide (for 2 people). I think we overpaid it but the guide was really worth it What to bring with you - plasters, if the leech bite you (you will bleed a lot), repelent, camera, swimsuit if you wanna swim at the waterfall, towel (if you are swimming :-) Toilet - there is a very very poor toilet at the beginning, many leeches outside.

He took us along well-trodden paths, spotting all sorts of creatures that we would have missed (surely they'd been stuck there for him to find!).  There were obviously other such groups being led around too, it's not as 'wild' as you might like.  We wore walking boots, mainly to ward off leaches (guides skip along in flip-flops!).  All fascinating, and I recommend it. The thing that ISN'T explained well enough is the 'waterfall swim' promised at the end.  They tell you to bring swimming stuff.  At a certain spot along the track we were suddenly told to change, and leave all our clothes etc. there so as to cross this river (very swollen in our case).  No real explanation.  Scary crossing of fast river with very slippery rocks.  Then, once on the other side, there's a path to walk to get to the waterfall - in bare feet - across roots and rocks(no idea of how far we'd be going) - about 15 mins probably.  The waterfall pool IS lovely, but the force of the fall is so great that it's difficult to actually swim. Then stagger back, and cross the river again.

We were clear we needed a guide in case we got lost but more importantly to tell us about the forest and the forest life and to make sure we had a great and safe experience. And we were so lucky - our guide was Sanjaya Ruwan. He was fantastic - paced the walk to suit our requirements, showed us scary things like a viper in a way that we were and felt completely safe, told us about the forest in ways we really appreciated, and took us to waterfalls where we could swim and enjoy the scene. You can go for a full day walk or even stay overnight - next time we would do this. We really recommend the forest and would suggest if you want to go you call Sanjaya directly as in some cases when hotels organise the visit they seem to take the bulk of the payment leaving very little for the guide. Sanjaya is a qualified guide, works for the forest department - his English was good (and we believe he also has some German and Russian) and with his keen eye we got to see things we never would have.

The present rain forests in the world are being an evolution of the earlier rain forests dating back to 150 – 200 million years. There had been three strips of large rain forest lands called Amazon, African and Far Eastern at that time. However these large extents of rain forest areas were later became less in area content and were confined to smaller areas. Then about 140 million years back, during the Paleosoic era, a part of land from the Southern hemisphere called Gondwana land, where present day India and Sri Lanka also were situated, started its slow process of separating from the main land.

In May 2013 I booked two nights in tents in Sinharaja for my family (including two teenage boys). It was to be our Christmas and Boxing Day treat and at over $2000 for two nights, by far the most expensive element of a two week trip.  To put the price into a Sri Lankan context, it cost more per night than renting the luxurious entirety of Taprobane Private Island (five double bedrooms and a private staff). As a family we have done similar 'birding' trips in Africa and South America and safety is paramount when travelling with children. We booked through this company as they seemed to be efficient and provided camps in Yala and other parks too. We knew what sort of thing to expect and not to expect luxury. We were there to see the rainforest and, hopefully contribute to its upkeep as well as the local tourist economy.  We chose to stay in standard tented accommodation as, at the time we booked, the only noted distinction between that and luxury accommodation was the fact that you didn't have a private loo.  At double the price we didn't feel that it was worth it - the website has changed a little since we booked, now offering 3 levels of accommodation. It became clear when we arrived that there was no dedicated vehicle associated with the camp. The company refers to a jeep on their website, we saw no evidence of one.  We had to wait 3/4 hour for a local guy in a pick up truck to turn up to take us into the rainforest (which we had to pay for). I am a fit, active 47 year old, however I twisted my ankle on the steep descent to the camp because there are no steps and we were left to carry our bags. It was wet slippy and dangerous.  We were the only ones staying in the camp. We had confirmed that we wanted a large tent for four (rather than two twos) and this company had confirmed that was available however not one of the small mouldy pod tents fitted that description. The whole atmosphere of the camp was edgy and unsafe. With nobody else there I even felt vulnerable as a woman and that it wouldn't be safe to leave our luggage there during the days. We were promised a guide, however, the (very nice) site manager Mr Kumar informed us that he could take us for a walk that afternoon and he was to be our guide.  He had arrived 3 weeks earlier from Kandy and knew nothing about Sinharaja.  There was no programme of what to visit/ what to see and Mr Kumar asked us what we wanted to do. At that point, we decided to leave.  The most distressing part of the whole experience was actually witnessing the grinding poverty of those who we met on the ground. Not a penny of the vast price we paid filtered to the locals.The thieves in this scenario bask further up the food chain and this is an extremely cynical operation.  Mr Kumar became almost panicky when we decided to go - he was so hungry that he wanted to eat before sorting things out for us and his meal was the left overs of our brief lunch. I spent 20 minutes on the phone to  Mr Janaka, his boss, to confirm that we were not leaving because of anything Mr Kumar had done - because he was scared of what would happen to him.  As we left Mr Kumar pointed out another camp and said that that one was a good one.  Perhaps the other one (on the website) was busy? Perhaps we were unlucky, who knows?  I have corresponded with Sri Lankan Expeditions since returning in the hope of reclaiming some of our money.  I like to give people a chance and I had hoped to be able to say at the end of this sorry tale that we were just unlucky and that this responsible company had reimbursed us some of our costs.  Not a bit of it! I have received two inaccurate, defensive emails and then - nothing. I have no idea whether they provide a good service in other camps elsewhere - but I have no intention of finding out.  AVOID at all costs! Go to Taprobane instead - it's cheaper!","January 14, 2014",0.0,0.0

This was just as well as the only footwear I took for this trip was pair of 30 year old Dunlop wellies, & my flip-flops :-/  I didn't want to take my good boots, & I couldn't find any good walking comfy boots to buy before I left for my holz, hence the wellies.  OK, So my poor old faithful wellies were laughed out of the forest as totally unsuitable, so I went with the flip-flops.  We arrived with sun tours in the posh car but the road to the forest wasn't suitable to go any further, so we had to use the tuk tuk to go the rest of the way. This was quite exciting as the road was not a road as such but a rather a bumpy ol' ride, I prayed that we wouldn't get tossed over the edge, & seeing as the driver was very good my prayers were answered.  We were introduced to Sarath who was to be our guide for the next few hours, he was brilliant as he actually carried my husband's very heavy camera rucksack for the whole of that time!  My husband had unfortunately hurt his leg & couldn't walk very well, but it wasn't a problem as Sarath took us on a nice easy route (there are many different ones).  So if you do have mobility probs you can still do the forest.  It was a nice walk, & we weren't too hot, wet, or sucked to death by leeches.  We saw monkeys, giant spiders, snakes, birds, lizards, water monitors, & a millipede, we weren't disappointed.  Why has no one on TripAdvisor ever mention the 'I'm A Celeb Get Me Outta Here' bridge?   Poor Sarath practically had his hand & arm ripped off as I clung to him for dear life, moaning & whinging ever step across the swinging bridge.  I lived to tell the tale & I'm so proud of me! We bumped in to some  German & French people on our way through the forest & stopped to chat, the leeches had got the french man, so they were there!  Actually we did see one leech but it was dead, so there's more proof of their existence.  We stopped off to rest once we'd gone across the bridge & there was lots of info & specimens to look at, a toilet too.  Unfortunately we didn't get as far as the waterfall as I'm afraid of water (you're expected to go in up to your waist) & my husband's leg was too bad for this.  We did however watch Sarath take a dip in the river, which we could've  done too if we'd been up to it.  Then we turned back & a lovely meal awaited us at Sinharaja View Villas Restaurant, oh how I love that Devilled Chicken!  It wasn't expensive & they served us ice cold Coke, not something I'd usually drink but it's good in hot countries.  They were lovely people & made us very welcome indeed, actually I'd've loved to have stayed there for a few days.  Next time maybe!","October 22, 2013",0.0,0.0

I love rainforests and though Mulu was quintessentially the best for us, we wanted to experience this one. Not wanting to go on 3,000rps trip from lodging with guide who is a bit of a self professed rainforest guru around these parts, we made our own way so we could turn back any time we needed to. We heard it is rough, leach infested and slippery. We made our own way there by bus from Deniyaya - about 10km until the road gets so rough it has to be covered on foot. The tuk tuk  from the bus can take you so far but it lurched violently about huge mud filled potholes until the road narrowed to a path and we got off. We declined the offer of guides and walked on arriving at the ticket hut with no-one in it and the side door locked. We walked on thinking we would pay the entry fee at the information centre 1 or 2 kms along the river trail. 200m along the way, we were accosted by two men on a motor bike who demanded we return to the empty ticket hut and pay our dues. We said no-one was there and we were happy to pay but why did we have to turn back. They insisted and looked threatening. We had breached some protocol or other and with leech attached, returned to the hut now open with a stroppy woman demanding we pay  and the Guide with two customers in tow yelling from behind that I had broken the law and the police would be after me as I entered the park without paying. I told him I'd gladly oblige if someone had been in attendance. I challenged the woman who when pressed said she had gone to the toilet. I went to pay the entry fee and then was told to pay for a guide but I wanted to go only as far as the information centre and not the 4 hour treck to the waterfall. This is Sri Lanka and they do things their way global commons  Unesco rainforest reserves or not!  Other places like Sigirya we have the option of a guide and I was not expecting it to be forced on me here. Like some museums.

The forest bed was slippery from the overnight rain & we fell down a couple of times (with no injuries) due to our muddy feet. Surprisingly there were very few leeches in this area. We came to a couple of virgin waterfalls which were out of this world. It was really refreshing to see something like this in the middle of no where.

Took a local bus from Hikkaduwa to Aluthgama to Matugama to Kalawana to Kuduawa village. Kuduwa village is at the nortern section of the forest. The journey took me around 6 hours and I had to change buses 4 times but it was a great journey. Then I took a nice long (30 minutes) trip on a diesel filled jeep to go up 2 km to Martin's lodge and then began the action. I am an avid traveller and very fond of the jungles. Having gone to a number of them around this region, I found the jungles of Singharaja to be similar to those in Periyar National Park in Kerala, India. However, these are raw jungles which shall command your respect. The trees are around 50mts tall. I must have seen around 40 different species of birds. On day 1 I walked down to the reserve's office, took a guide and walked with him into the jungles. The walk starts at around 0830 hrs and continues till around 1300 hrs. You can tip the guide about 200Rs. The jungles are very thick and so the visibility is not more than a few feet at many occasions. Small streams flow around and the jungles are chirping with birds and monkeys (the monkeys, purple faced, aren't comfortable coming close to the people). There tend to be leeches but I carried a pocket knife, kept checking my boots and must have removed around 15, though 2 managed to get me (for around 2 minutes each). I think the leech socks arent really that required. The guide wears flip flops! Carry binoculars if you want to see the birds (which you should). Carry water, though the spring water in the taps is perfect, forget the bottled stuff. Ensure you don't visit the jungles during the rainy season. It pours in this place in the summers! I took a nice long walk into the village on the second day. Saw lots of birds (albeit slightly common) and saw the gentle village life. Drink a cup of tea at the main square and buy some palm jaggery locally made. The people, as in other parts, are lovely. Especially if you stay at Martin's lodge. Enjoy","April 24, 2013",0.0,0.0

For example we saw chameleons, monkeys, a giant centipede, a big waspnest, a little green snake... First we thougt our guide was quite laid-back, but he was more alert than he looked and spotted a lot of animals. He told us about the vegetation and helped me also to remove the leaches from my legs. We had to cross a river and ended the tour by a nice waterfall. It was a shame we didn't know that, otherwise we had brought some swimmingclothes and towels. After having lunch, we had to take the same path back.

Look away now if you don;t like people whinging about costs ..... As some reviews have said here, sinharaja i a great spot for jungle walks and an opportunity to visit unspoilt forest. The entry fee, plus the cost of a mandatory guide meant that I didn't get to see Sinharaja nor did I get to see any of the national parks of sri lanka for the same reason.  Why do tourists have to fork out $80 for a guide and car to visit national parks whilst locals pay just Rs30?? I wish that foreign tourists would boycott the national parks of SL in protest at the stupid money-grabbing pricing. ha, fat chance of that happening hey!?","February 1, 2012",0.0,0.0

Our park guide was very good - knew his birds and worked very hard looking for the specialties like Sri Lankan Frogmouth and Seredip Scops Owl. We had 2 days in the park and loved it. The sheer variety of wildlife and plant life is fantastic and Sinharaja is unique in many ways. To watch the mixed feeding flocks of birds pass through makes the trip worthwhile. Yes, there are leeches, but the leech socks available from he park work well. All part of the adventure!","January 2, 2012",0.0,0.0

HOWEVER: USER BEWARE. There are tons of leeches. You can either go in flip flops and that way you'll see them or wear your socks, which they can go through. I wore socks and shoes, because i'm not used to walking on forested trails in flip flops. I got 8 leeches and my socks and shoes were FULL of blood. And the bites continue bleeding for hours and hours afterwards. It was really kind of gross, but also kind of cool in a weird way. So if you're really squeamish about creepy crawlies, perhaps not the best activity for you.","November 18, 2011",0.0,0.0

The forest itself can be entered from multiple places - we took the norhtern entrance so situation may be little different in other places. Be aware that in addition to the entrance fee you have to pay for a mandatory guide (you cannot enter by yourself). The guide is one for a group and it is not as expensive as it may seem - we paid less than two thousand rupees for the entrance for two persons, everything included. The quality of your visit is highly influenced by the quality of your guide - be sure to check that he AT LEAST speaks in your language well. While we were lucky and ended up with an experienced guide that told us a lot of interesting information and knew local plants and animals well, others were not - we met a Swiss group who had a much less usefull young boy who mostly smiled and did not talk much. The trip consist of a roughly three hour walk through a well traveled path and then of a short walk through a small path taking you into the heart of the forest. The length is very variable depending on your speed and on your curiosity. You will mostly see flora - lot's of trees, flowers, orchids, shrubs, lianas and other green things. Don't expect too much fauna - while the forest is densely inhabitated, the animals are shy and mostly run away from the tourist paths. We saw mostly snakes, lizards, birds, butterflies, millipedes, squirrels, spiders and catterpillars (and also a behinds of a bunch of running monkeys). Don't expect any of the ""more interesting""animals like monkeys, leopards and tarantulas because they are hidden in the middle of the park and even the guides see them rarely. Last tip: come prepared. Long trousers are a MUST as well as long socks and firm footwear. The small paths are filled with leeches and while they are not as bad as it sounds, it's better to avoid them. (They are small worms, not even one inch long, they are living on ground on wet areas and stick to your shoes and then crawl up. They can crawl throuh small holes in shoes, socks and trousers. They stick to your skin - it does not hurt and you won't even notice and you can just pull them off - they will leave a small bite. They are not dangerous in any way though, so do not be paranoid :)","September 16, 2011",0.0,0.0

Nothing has been altered to attract more tourists. Not even road signs. The experience was truly breathtaking & unique. A Trek through a virgin rainforest without the fear of being attacked by wild animals. There’re many areas in Sinharaja that no human being has set foot on. Nobody ventures that deep into the rainforest. The tree growth got thicker & thicker as we went in. These are the moments that defy all the other experiences in our lives. No human contact, no mobile coverage, no nearby hospitals, but only the sound of the insects & the deep darkness of the forest in a sunny afternoon. Old sinhala legends claim that the forest was royal territory belonging to ancient kings & in some early colonial records, the rainforest is referred to as the “Rajasinghe Forest” We stopped only for a little rest at times, since we had lots of ground to cover. But the amount of time dedicated for certain beauties of the nature was priceless. The variety of the vegetation was exquisite. The further we ventured into the forest, the distance between two trees got closer. There’re some parts of the forest where we couldn’t see more than 20 feet ahead. Sinharaja is filled with birds, butterflies & snakes. I was fortunate enough to witness several of their kind. If you enjoy the natural bio-diversity, this is the best place to be in Sri Lanka to study about them. there's a research center inside the forest as well. There're no wild animals except for a couple of wild elephants who're rarely seen.","January 5, 2011",0.0,0.0

I can not give you any technical details about the place, (but i see that the person who wrote the previews review did a great job) but i can tell you what its like for an outsider to visit this place. We drove to Sinharaja  early morning, after driving through some beautiful hills full of tea plantations, we arrived at the entrance. The entrance fee to the forest is around 600Rupees per person  and we had our video camera with us so we had to pay an extra fee for it, but trust me, its totally worth it.  it all came down to around 10 euros for the both of us plus the cost of the guide. Let me start by saying that the best time to visit this place is from January to April, when its dry season so there is no rain. The first time we went to Sinharaja it was May 2008, and it was rainy season so there was the huge problem of Leeches, which we had heavily underestimated and we just went there in our shorts and sandals. From the moment we went in to the forest,  every ten minutes we would be wiping off Leeches from our legs and cleaning the blood, you have to know that when leeches start sucking your blood you dont feel a thing, when they stop thats when the blood starts to flow and you realize that you have been bitten.  its really scary but fortunately u dont catch anything from them. u just bleed for a few minutes thats all. This time we went it was dry season so there werent so many leeches, but we went prepared anyways, rubber boots and track pants so there were a couple of desperate leeches who were looking for a way to get in the boots. But anyways, always go prepared. The guides that accompany you are really great.  they speak english and they will tell you everything you want to know and the names of every single animal and insect, and even the names of every single tree. We saw so many beautiful butterflies that were so huge that at first we thought they were birds. We also saw lots of beautiful birds, many of these you find only in Srilanka. and many different species of Lizards, some very rare Animals as well, like the Frog Mouth Owl which was so amazing to see. lots of snakes, water snakes and if you are lucky, you may see some wild cats. If you are a Nature lover, or if you love hiking or u just love watching those documentries about rainforests and always wanted to visit one, well this is the place for you.
