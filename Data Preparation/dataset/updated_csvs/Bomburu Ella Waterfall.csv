It’s a different experience than visiting Haggala garden or worlds end. To reach the destination, use google map. After a few Km passing Haggala gardens you need to turn right & sign board with direction are there. Do not start climbing from the first entry as its little difficult. Just pass the main entrée and drive another few hundred meters.  Ask for the path that going along with small canal. I went with my two kids 5 & 8 years & they enjoy wel. We went on a sunny day I am not sure how it will be on rainy day. You need to pay 20 as entry ticket. It will take 40 to 60 mins to reach to the waterfall. Take water with you, but there are many small shops who sale tea & local short eats. You are not allowed to bath in the water fall & If you badly need a bath get it from somewhere far from water fall as water from waterfall directly pump for drinking water.","August 9, 2019",0.0,0.0

The walk is great and the little falls along the way to the large waterfall are stunning. Really quiet, not crammed with tourists and 50LKR each which goes towards conservation in the area. There are little stalls to get fruit and tea along the bottom, but no restaurants which is nice as it’s not built up.","January 27, 2019",0.0,0.0

With a 2 year old who was alternatively being carried and walking, it took us around two hours. But the breathtaking views and the cool weather prevents you from feeling any tiredness at all. Once you reach the top, the waterfall is magnificent. You can rest, have a picnic and take a bathe if you wish. On the way back, we chose a different path and came across some beautiful farmlands that were a treat to the eyes.

It's that please make this place as unavailable as it already is. This place is pristine and untouched. Not many drivers will accept to make the detour since it's remote and unknown. I've seen too many beautiful sights that were ruined by tourism and this wasn't one of them. The trail was beautiful and the waterfalls just as nice. You will probably meet people along the way that offer you food and drinks. We had the pleasure to sit with a wonderful lady who made us coconut rotis and served us masala chai.

It was our last day in Nuwara Eliya so we thought why not, let's do it! It was the best decision ever! The driver told us that this location is not approved by the tourism authorities or something like that so it took us some time and extra cash to convince him to take us. The climb itself to reach the waterfall is amazing and fun. I wouldn't call it a HIKE but maybe a mini hike for those who don't regularly do this. Some might find it tricky to get there but you'll reach the waterfall eventually. I uploaded 3 photos just to give you a hint of what to expect. I wouldn't recommend going there on a rainy day. Oh, and the water stream has leeches which freaked us out when we stepped inside and they started to stick and suck the blood from our feet BUT apparently they're harmless.
