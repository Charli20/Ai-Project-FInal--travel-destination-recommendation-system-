We picked the wrong day as the sea was very calm - choose a day when the sea is rough and you will have a proper show 2. The winding path goes uphill twice in stages. Wear comfortable trainer type shoes as the man made jagged rock paths are hard work. I mistakenly wore flip flops and I suffered and spoilt my experience as I was worried about breaking them. 3. Be aware that along the paths the smell is not good as many locals home have fish drying in the sun. 4. Make sure you are fit and healthy. You will struggle otherwise to go up the rock paths. 5. The cost is very very cheap - 500 rupees. However difficult to say how that money is reinvested to make a better experience (improve paths and make them safe and enclosed from local homes).,"March 13, 2024",0.0,0.0

We saw people throwing rubbish completely unrestrained in the square. It stank and all the way to the ticket booth was full of rubbish. The people were not at all like the nice Sri Lankans we know. And they demanded Rs 500 for a ticket for foreigners at the entrance. Rs 50 for natives. An experience that made us very sad.

But make sure to check before you go: during some months there will be hardly any water spray coming up through the blow-hole. We were lucky and got to see its full splendour. Locals operate several (paid) vehicle parks - you must park there and then walk the rest of the way. It would've been good to have some signs giving information about the walk: because, from the car park, we had to walk around 200m or so, most of which involved stairs and/or rocky terrain. We were not aware of this and one member of our group who had difficulty climbing stairs had to stop and turn back halfway there. The walkway winds through a fishing village and on either side of the path there are stalls selling dried fish products. There is a viewing area secured with metal bars for safety.

The water from the waves goes into the rock and as diameter becomes small gains more pressure and comes up through the hole in the stone making seawater to go up in the air giving a sound and a spray of water. Height of the water going up in the air depends on the volume and the speed of the waves. Therefore from July onward, the waves are high and the spray is high too.

Those who travel downsouth, the blowhole is located at Kudawella (around Dickwella) which is around 32km from the Matara -Godagama expressway exit. From the main Tangalle road, route to the blowhole is a bit tricky. You can always seek assistance from the locals to locate it. There are many private parking areas around. You need to park and walk up and down for around 600 - 700 meters. While the hike, there are locals & residents who sell fried fishes, dried fishes and pickles. We grabbed some guava pickle which helped us to much during the 10 minutes walk. You come to a point to buy tickets (Rs. 20/- for locals and Rs. 250/- for foreigners) and then again continue the walk. The blowhole is covered with a safety railing. It shoots up a gust upto nearly 70 - 80 feet. Quite an interesting thing to watch. TIP: Bring water as you become thirsty after the walk. Make sure you wear a cap / hat and a bit of sun cream to be shady under the scorching sun - though there's a lot of shade while walking, the area where the blowhole is doesn't have shade and you just need to stand and wait until it shoot up water.","December 27, 2017",0.0,0.0

When the caverns are filled to capacity, the ensuing pressure causes the water to escape through a small hole to form a giant fountain. caused when sea water rushes through a submerged cavern and is pushed upwards. The sea water flows underneath the shore, and then comes out of this hole due to pressure. The water fountain created by the geological feature shoots up every couple of minutes, depending on the nature of the sea, with the spray often reaching as high. & it's without a doubt a beautiful freak of nature. Due to the unique positioning of many rocks, water gets accumulated in a tank like rock pool & with the next wave of water, this entire tank of water gets pressurized & gets pushed above through a small opening on top of the tank creating the blow hole. hummanaya is Located in Mawella, a small town in Dickwella (8km from Dikwella) , the blowhole is completely natural where sea spray due to the high water pressure sprays through a blowhole up to sometimes 10 to 50 feet high. This usually happens during the monsoon season and draws in quite a crowd. The local Municipal council manages the spot and the attending employee is very knowledgeable to read the waves and indicate when one is about to occur and weather its going to be a large one or small...a must visit on your way down south. The road leading up to the Blow Hole is in a bad shape since we had to travel through a shanty area. But this was well worth it once we saw the Hummanaya with its loud hissing sound. The only criticism being the initial approach thru some people backyards..its like walking thru a slum..some sort of clearance needs to be done at that stage but once you get up its nice and pristine.","November 20, 2017",0.0,0.0

However, upon getting there we were told parking would cost. We sent away our tuktuk hoping to get another after the visit. The entrance fee was 250Rs per person which is a lot considering you get to watch a rock formation that supposedly shoots water in the air. Save yourself that money and throw a bucketful of water in the air. Have someone taking a photo. That'll be about the experience you get here. We waited for 30 min with no action except a local guy asking for selfies with us. That was fun. Why they charge for an attraction like this (only worth visiting during specific time) is beyond me. Would be an okay place if it was free. Not worth it.","September 24, 2016",0.0,0.0

Well the blow hole is most active when the seas are at their strongest time. That would be the peak of the south west monsoon period. I asked some residents that we got friendly and we were told that July to August would be the best time to see the blowhole activity and according to my friends who's been here before the water sprouts every minute or so and supposed to be a good sight. When I went in May it was a lull period.  25 rupees is the entrance for locals and 250 for foreigners. I had to wait for 15 mins till it sprouted for the first time and it happened at interests of around 15 mins. The surrounding area is quite beautiful though. The blow hole it self is in high ground and you get a amazing view of the surrounding areas. We took our phantom drones and got some good videos. Now going to hummanaya in the active season brings it drawbacks as well. Firstly Since the seas are rough you wouldn't be able to enjoy the beaches in the south coast. Secondly since it's the off season for tourist in the south west it will be bit more boring to stay in the area. I would only stop by  if I was going to Yala or some part of the east coast and I took the southern highway and exited through Matara. Since I am a frequent traveler I think I might get the chance to see it in its peak and will write a review on how it looks during its peak.,"May 9, 2016",0.0,0.0

I had a feeling it wouldn't be that dramatic as the sea was not very rough, but thought it worth a try.  When I reached the village nearby, it was disappointingly touristy, with stalls selling all sorts of tat.  After a short walk I came to the cliff, where a large cleft is surrounded by new thick silvery railings, which I hadn't expected in a country not known for its Health&Safety laws!  I liked the attractive multicoloured rocks, and waited a few moments until the attendant said the waterspout was coming.  It just about managed the ""hoo"" noise, but the water only spurted up about 2 metres, extremely disappointing, though not surprising.  The attendant begged me to stay, promising something better, so I waited about 20 minutes, and saw 3 more weak efforts, the highest being about 3 metres.  Apparently it can shoot up to 20 metres or more in the right conditions, so it would be worth trying in the height of the monsoon season when the sea would be very rough..

The blowhole itself is a natural wonder created in the middle of this cliff. There is a gap through which seawater comes gushing up with a loud hoooooooo sound. At that precise moment it gives the impression of a tall fountain. The water pressure builds up more or less every 15 minutes and sometimes the stunning spray can rise as high as 100 feet. Seeing this blow hole is a really heady experience.","August 18, 2011",0.0,0.0
