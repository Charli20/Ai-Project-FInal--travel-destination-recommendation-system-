It’s got a chill vibe, perfect for catching up with friends or spending some relaxed time with your parents. One of the best parts is free car parking, which is a rare bonus in the city. The area has a few food stalls offering tasty and affordable eats from snacks to full meals, it’s a decent place to grab something without breaking the bank. You can find places with decent outdoor seating where you can just hang out and enjoy the vibe, especially in the evenings. That said, it’s not the best place for families with young kids, as there’s not much to do in terms of entertainment or activities. It’s more of a spot for chilling, not exploring or shopping extensively. Overall, it’s a great casual spot to hang out without spending too much and the calm surroundings and historic architecture add to the charm.","April 9, 2025",0.0,0.0

Negative points: This arcade was designed strictly form over function -  you have to walk a very long distance to the toilets, which are not part of the main building so if it is raining, you will get properly soaked.

Two old government owned buildings fully renovated and gave a new appearance as a perfect business and hangout place in the heart of Colombo city. It was opened year before. Arcade Independence Square is a shopping complex with a mini cinema (I was never had the cinema experience yet). It has a large area for just sit and relax and I recommend it for some business meetings too. You cannot do any activities inside the premises. In the Arcade Independence Square premises, Photography is allowed. There are many wedding couples who are taking pictures and the modernize location is really suiting for those kind of needs. There are many shops but the price is quite high as Sri Lankan economy. There are many food outlets and the quality of food is really good. The restrooms (washrooms) are located in the building which is bit far from main buildings and that is the only bad thing I found out. The parking area is really really big and at any time you can find a parking slot. Finally, Arcade Independence Square is a quality place to spend some time.

I finally got the chance to check the place out since I was in the vicinity of it. The only thing worth checking out here is the architecture, which is quite something, with the fancy wooden floorboards, the fountains and the likes. However, there's nothing else worth checking out here. Actually, much as I hate to say it, I think Majestic City is better than the Arcade Independence Square, since, at least, at MC, the things being sold in shops aren't exorbitantly priced! Therefore, if you're interested in shopping, this ISN'T the place for you. If you're interested in just chilling out, catching up with friends, this IS the place for you.","September 29, 2014",0.0,0.0

The shops were not yet well patronised. The theatre facilities sounded impressive. The restaurants were aplenty. The Asylum restaurant and the many artefacts in corridors lent its own charm to this unique attraction.  Parking could be a deterrent and an irritation. Yu could take a walk in the adjoining walking tracks and relax browsing through the arcade.","September 22, 2014",0.0,0.0

Beautifully decorated and outfitted. Its the brain child of Gothabya the Minister for development to attract tourists to Sri Lanka. There are also a number of restaurants housed in this building. No Tuk Tuks are allowed, so they are trying to make this an exclusive area.  Cabs are welcome though and is only a 10 min ride from the major hotels along Galle Road. Dont miss visiting.  I bought a beautiful silk top for a fraction of the price I would pay in Australia at Aashkii. They also have scarves handbags and dresses.  Enjoy!.","August 8, 2014",0.0,0.0
