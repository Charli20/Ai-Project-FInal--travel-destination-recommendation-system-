I went out at 6.30 (6 should be even better I think) and saw lot's of birds and a lot of water monitor lizards (some big ones) and to top it all off I saw an eagle (Brahminy Kite actually) swooping down and catch a fish couple of meters in front of me on my last 5 minutes... I was completely alone the whole time, very relaxing...When I was done at 9.45 I just saw two other kayaks entering the water. I enjoyed it so much I returned at 4pm to have another go at it... Lot's of birds returning, saw some monkeys in the trees (grey langurs) jumping over my head from tree to tree, and when it became more dark I also saw some bats... Downside at this time, bit more people out. Not that many though, saw like 9 others kayaks... If you decide to do this, make sure to inform at Mallika Guesthouse... Very friendly people and they only ask 750 lkr and tell you to take your time and enjoy, most others charge 1000 to 1500 lkr and some even say you have to pay extra if you exceed a 2 hour time limit (which I did with a big margin both times).

It’s hard to rate this experience - on the one hand we saw so many animals (cormorants, darters, 4 kinds of heron, 2 kinds of bittern, water monitors- one of them tucking into a spot of bird for breakfast!), and some of them were just 2 meters away - a wonderful experience, especially in the mangrove tunnels at the start. On the other hand, the far end of the lagoon (which is where you’re told to go, as that is where the monitors are), is right next to the A2, with all the noise and especially the litter that that engenders. Especially the garbage is heartbreaking. Plastic bottles and bags can be seen everywhere in the far lagoon. We saw one heron that appeared to have its beak stuck shut with a plastic ring, that it probably picked up by accident. 5 stars for the animal encounters, 1 star for the trash situation.","January 12, 2018",0.0,0.0
