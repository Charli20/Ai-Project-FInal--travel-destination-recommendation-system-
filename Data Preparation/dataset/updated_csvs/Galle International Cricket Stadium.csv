This was saved from ruin post the Tsunami by Shane Warne who organized a cricket game raising over $1m. Warnie is a legend here. There is a media box located at one end of the ground as well as the Players rooms. At square leg, you will find the Pavillion. Word has it that this is the place to be when watching a game. A beautiful stadium located next to the Fort, watch a game from there, with a quaint old-fashioned scoreboard. I can't wait to watch the next game there, Bangladesh soon, and see it on tv.

The ground only holds around 8000 people but there was probably another 2000 people watching for free from the ramparts. The downside is that we watched possibly the last Test match that will be played at that ground.
