Starting at the same point as the popular World's End trail in Horton Plains National Park, the Kirigalpoththa Trail diverges to the right, offering an adventure for those seeking a more challenging and less-traveled path. Distance: 14 km round trip Elevation Gain: 250 meters Terrain: The trail passes through plains, bog, cloud forest, and rock, providing a diverse and captivating landscape. The path is not as well marked or visible as some of the other trails in the area. Be prepared with food, water, and first aid. However, there are plenty of very clean water sources along the way where you can refill your bottles. Please note that single-use plastics are not permitted on the trail. Ensure you arrive at the starting point no later than 10:30 AM; otherwise, you may not be permitted to enter the trail. The trail offers sightings of Sambar deer, with the possibility of spotting Wildcats, Leopards, Boars, and a variety of birds. Due to the cloud forest, a clear view from the top is rare, but the joy of this hike is the adventure of getting there. The trail passes across wetlands, grassland, and forest, providing a rich tapestry of biodiversity.","April 23, 2024",0.0,0.0

Lovely weather, amazing views with a sprinkling of adventure. Things to note: It starts at the same place as the horton plains trail. You just need to take the path towards the right instead of the horton plains one towards the left. The path is not as well marked or visible as the horton plains one. Hence, download the trail on Google maps before you start. Unless you are an experienced hiker who is used to navigating on your own it is better to travel with a guide or an experienced hiker. (We traveled with a friend who is a well known mountain climber). In certain places you do come across large areas of muddy ground (It had rained the day before our hike) and we had to deviate from the trail in several places. (For context, the sole of one my sneakers came off when I was trying to take my foot off from on one such mud pool). Take food, water and first aid. But there are plenty of very clean water sources which we used to refill our bottles. You will not be allowed to take single - use plastics. But I noticed the authorities were more lenient on the Kirigapotta hikers (than horton plains ones) on enforcing this rule. What to wear: The weather is mild and there are no leeches or other insects. But covered clothing is recommended if you want to avoid getting scratches from tree branches. Time taken: We started at 9.30 am and returned at 5 pm which included lots of snack/ photo breaks and spending one hour at the top. Start at early as possible so you can return before dark. If I remember correctly the forest office will not let you start after 11 am. Difficulty level: It's 14 kms round trip. There is no clear path. But it's mostly flat land. You will have to climb only in the last 1 -2 kms and there is steep ledge right towards the summit. In certain places you have to cut across thick forest cover and cross a few small streams. We are not regular hikers nor are we regular gym - goers. It was mildly tiring but doable. (All the aches and pains came only on the day after;)  For comparison I would say, I found climbing 5000 plus Adam's Peak much more strenuous.","February 6, 2023",0.0,0.0

We were told it would take three and half hours to get to the top, but we made it in two hours and fifteen minutes. We did not take a break except for a very quick pause for a drink of water. We were lucky it was clear on the top to be able to absorb in all the scenic beauty surrounding us and enjoy our well-deserved snacks. It had rained on the previous night(s) and the path was pretty muddy. We were happy we had a local guide (required by law as well) to find the path in knee-deep reeds for the first half an hour. Then we passed through wet pasture trying not to fall into mud puddles. Then there was light climbing at first through wet muggy woods and finally some rocky ground. Then it was all uphill. It was a good climb, but I would not say it is impossible to do for anyone with some level of fitness. If you are not the regular-exercise-type of person, plan to take a lot of breaks before hitting the summit. It is worth all the trouble to get there. Make sure to take plenty of water, a change of shirt. You will be soaking-wet with your own sweat and would not be comfortable when a cold breeze blows by. Yes, a windbreaker or any long-sleeved shirt is also recommended. There are no leeches, so you only have to watch out for not-so-firm ground and slippery rocks and/or wet slopes. If you like mountains, this is a good one to climb in Sri-lanka.","February 3, 2022",0.0,0.0

It's a 14km round walk and hike. You need some strength to accomplish this hike.  Though it is a very nice and scenic hike a lot of people turn back in the middle of their trail.

And if you're not a fit person you will certainly have a tough time completing it..... We went as a group of 13 and half of them were unfit, therefore it took way more than 6 hours to complete. At the entrance we were warned to stay as group throughout the journey. Most parts of the trial were filled with mud and out of 13 almost everyone slipped at least once during the hike. Within the first 15 minutes we spotted a wild dog which was running around the plains. Sambar deer were all over the place. And we were lucky enough to spot the elusive purple faced leaf monkey just outside the entrance. Occasionally you might come across leopard footprints especially on sandy track. After completing the hike I had mixed feelings whether was it worth the risk & time because the views from the top of Ella Rock and World's End were much better and the hikes were easy comparing to this.......","May 4, 2018",0.0,0.0

This one is less popular than the ella rock but imo it is nicer as it has a more rugged feel to it.You pass a beautiful refreshing stream where you can rest and unwind.wildlife wise there were alot of birds but not much else although we saw foot prints of a wild boar,deer and elephant(unlucky?).","July 9, 2016",0.0,0.0

It is best if one can be at the entrance ( park gate) at 06.00am ,when the office open for issuing tickets. From park entrance to the trail head its about 3.5 KM .If you don't have your own transportation one has to hire a vehicle or a TUK TUK (Trishaw) which is the cheapest and best I suppose from your hotel or Ohiya railway station. It took me 4hrs to complete my trekking 7Km up and down total of 14 km. Difficulty  level is I would say moderate/Easy except the last stretch up the rock. The last couple of meters to the top I negotiated with all my fours since it is very narrow. Once you are on top you can see the beauty of the surrounding mountains and villages.

So clear, cold and fresh! the best view is the ledge just before the summit. the actual peak is such an anti-climax after that, but the path drops away to cliffs on both sides which is quite thrilling! we did it in 5:21 hours because we got a late start. Else we would have stayed at the top longer. We got caught in mist and rain on the way back, which was also an adventure in itself!

Visibility is quite low and We couldn't see more than 10m ahead. We started the trek at about 6am. Did not hire a guide. Just followed the trail. At the time we didn't quite understand why we were walking through the fog and mist. It beings with a steep climb. The trail circles through the park. At the fork in the road, our guide back at the Grand Hotel, Nuwara Eliya suggested we turn to the left. This brings you through the forest. Its a gradual uphill climb. Trees on either side so not much to see around. At about 8 am we got to the Mini World's end. By this time the Sun was up and the skies clear. Breathtaking view of the surrounding mountains and lakes. We stopped here for about 15 minutes for pictures. The next stop was the world's end. There's a climb higher up which is off the trail. Great place for pictures at the cliff. The view makes walking through the cold mist worth it! The rest of the trek from World's end was through the plains. Picturesque gradual slopes and grass covered plains. The mist is unpredictable and disappears as suddenly as it appears. There is a deviation off the trail to see Baker's Falls. Its a steep climb with a mixture of concrete stairs and tree roots as stepping stones. Stopped at the falls for about 20 minutes. There is an alternative route from here which is along the river. We didn't go back to the point we deviated off the trail to see the falls. Walking through the plains we figured we would have missed these magnificent views had we walked straight at the fork as the fog/mist would have swallowed the landscape. Back at the starting point at 10:30 am. The terrain changes from flat and sandy to steep and rocky quite randomly. Would suggest wearing comfortable and strong shoes. It does get quite cold in the morning. But was warm when we were done. The park does not allow any plastic (excluding water bottles) inside. So pack all food in paper bags or carry fruit. The fog was back when we left the park at 11am. It's essential to get the timings and the route correct to ensure you get to the view points for a view and not just fog!

We were dressed in hiking outfits and were carrying back packs which was almost 15 to 20 Kg. The parks elevation is around 6900 ft and our destination was 7,838 ft above sea level. The hike was approximately around 1,000 ft. The distance is 7 to 8 Km one-way!. Many ascends and descends on the way to the summit. Within the first Km of our journey we unexpectedly came across the Sri Lankan Sambar Deer just 20 ft away from us. The Small Herd consisted about 4 female deer. Once they had spotted us one of the deer made a warning sound and fled towards the covers without permitting us an opportunity to capture their beauty in a photograph. Further towards the mountain around two km from the starting point there is a small stream. This is the junction which separates the path into two. One leads to the Kirigalpoththa Summit and the other leads to Bogowanthalawa about 4967 ft above sea level. From that point on wards the hike is very challenging and has the most breath taking views. At some points we were amazed by the view we even forgot to take photographs. :(. After passing few plains we were almost lost due to a trail which was misleading us. Getting back to the track took us around one hour. Exhausted we continued our ascend through the correct path. We reached the summit at around 1.00 PM and Stayed there for 1 1/2 hours. With the greatest regret we started our descend promising to our self that we will return to relive the adventure once again. We reached the Horton Plains Nature park at around 5.15 PM. This trail is the best trail that i have being so far. All hikers should make sure not to carry heavy back packs so that you could enjoy your hike. Be a careful observer so that you could get a glimpse of the enchanted wildlife in this terrain.","August 24, 2013",0.0,0.0
