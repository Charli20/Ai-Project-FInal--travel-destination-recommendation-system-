No photos allowed inside the factory.The girl gave good explanation but at times it was difficult to hear what she said. Only the fanning was working when the tea leaves separated debris thus dusts on the floor and staff cleaning machines. Only worth buying Pedro tea as nowhere else sells it ! 95 % for export and only 5 % probably in the shop . It’s the tea brits drink under different names!","August 19, 2025",0.0,0.0

The visitor centre opens at 8 am. We had an excellent tour at 8.30am with Kaushi. The cutting machines and sorting machines were still working. Sadly no photos are allowed inside the factory which is such a shame. The tour took about 20 mins and was really informative. Then we were given a cup of tea on the balcony overlooking the plantation. We also paid another 1000 rupees for the plucking tour. This was very disappointing and not worth the money. Kaushi gave us bags to wear and took us out to the tea plantation. She explained how the pluckers work, selecting one bud and two leaves and then said we had 20 minutes to pick tea ourselves. We decided against that, instead walking to photograph some of the tea pluckers. Of course they wanted to be reimbursed for having their photos taken, so have plenty of small notes and wear sturdy shoes!","July 4, 2025",0.0,0.0

Pedro Tea Factory is an absolute rip-off! They charge 1000 rupees just for a basic factory visit – no complimentary tea, no plantation walk, nothing extra. That price is outrageous considering other tea factories in the area offer much better service and a more immersive experience for half the price or even free. On top of that, the staff were shockingly rude and unwelcoming. They clearly don’t care about tourists or customer service. It felt like we were an inconvenience to them. There are plenty of other tea factories in Nuwara Eliya that are far more worth your time and money. Don’t waste either of those at Pedro. Highly disappointing.","April 17, 2025",0.0,0.0

And it turned out be the best tea factory tour we've had so far! It was a precise and concise tour of 20 mts where they take you through each division of the factory while explaining the tea making process from end to end. And it was also the most informative of all the tea factory tours we've had so far. The lady who did the tour did an excellent job. She was very knowledgeable and answered many questions. We went there around 10.30 am and immediately joined a tour that was just about to start. After the tour you get a nice cup of tea. (I think there are tours every half an hour.) If you arrive while a tour is ongoing they will serve you tea first which you can enjoy in their tea lounge while enjoying the lovely view. We paid LKR 500 each and I think it was the same for locals and foreigners. No photos or videos are allowed inside the factory. [If I am nitpicking, the aprons they provide visitors to wear during the tour can do with a makeover.] We Also learnt that the name of the Estate is pronounced as ""Peedro"" (not ""Pedro"")  same as how the British colonists called ""Piduruthalaga"" the highest mountained ""Mount Pedro"", pronounced as ""Mount Peedro"". The factory is quite close to Nuwara Eliya town. Road conditions are good. It's on the side of the Udupussellawa road and there is ample parking inside the property. They also have a collection of single estate tea for sale. If you are interested in touring a tea factory and learning about the tea making process I would highly recommend this tour.","December 31, 2024",0.0,0.0

We took a Tuk-tuk from the hotel and the driver waited for us while we did the tour (approx 45 minutes in total including time to drink and buy tea). Very informative tour with a chance to see production from start to end with a good tour guide who was keen to answer questions. Great selection of tea to buy with a good explanation of what you are buying. We brought lots back.

The factory tour takes about 20 minutes and costs 500 LKR per person.  Most of the machinery in the factory was sitting idle, but our guide said that the processing was done at night due to the different humidity and drying qualities.  A number of reviewers have said how informative their tour was, but that wasn't the case with ours. Our tour guide was quite unengaged. The tour felt rushed, she parroted a few facts quickly and quietly in each room of the factory, and was very difficult to hear or understand. I don't think anyone on our tour came away with much more knowledge on tea production than they went in with. You weren't permitted to take photos in rooms with grading equipment. The reception area of the tours was modern, with a balcony overlooking a small tea planting.

We were told that the only two activities we could do where the two (more expensive at 1100 Rs pp) “experiences” of Tea tasting or Tea picking; we opted for the tea tasting. We said we understood that the factory was closed for tours but asked if it would be possible to pop our heads round to see the inside of the factory? The woman said yes. So we sat down for our tea tasting, and after 10 minutes a tray of tea was plonked in front of us, a different woman pointed and said some teas were strong and others weren’t, and then departed(!) There was no explanation about the variations of tea on the tray, how they are grown, or what they were even! Nothing. Nada. We were just left to our tray of random teas. It was an absolute joke. We tried to find someone to ask questions but got minimal information and no actual explanation on the process. We then said asked if we could have a quick look round the door at the factory, and the woman in charge said “yes that’s fine, that’ll be Rs.350 each” i.e. the cost of the tour which we had initially asked for and were told that we couldn’t do!! I queried why we were told merely 15 minutes earlier that we couldn’t do the tour of the tea factory, at which point the woman basically lied to us and claimed she had included it as an option!! She was basically scoffing at us as she spoke implying that all 3 of us had misunderstood. The Sri Lankan driver who had driven us there and was waiting and had heard the whole thing was as shocked as we were at the audacity of this woman. (And won’t be recommending anyone go there again).

The guide's accent was a bit hard to understand at the best of times (not her fault as English is her second language), but she told two members of our tour group (who English was also not their first language for) that taking photos was not allowed. They clearly did not hear her/understand what was being said, and instead of gently making sure they understood, she yelled at them ""do you even speak English?!"".

Tickets comes with a free cup of tea which is free to enjoy before or after the tour. Boutique's clean and well maintained ambiance was so relaxing and offer a perfect view of the greeny tea estate. There was a fair collection of Ceylon tea to be purchased. However, lesser verities. Didn’t see a large collection of flavoured or infused teas. Reason may be this place only sells the pure tea straight from their factory without any infusions or additions. Only pure tea as it is. “Lover’s Leap”, the Boutique got this name in reference to a nearby waterfall with the same name. Supposedly the name was given after an ancient prince and his lover leapt into death from the particular waterfall. Tour was fairly short since the factory is small (just about 10-15 minutes).

Expecting her to at least tell us what kind of tea we would be served (to this moment we do not know) or asking us whether we had any questions was apparently too much to ask. We would have at least partially understood this kind of attitude had the factory been busy,but we only came across three other guests in the facilities who had already been taken care of. Definitely not worth 250 rupees. We ended up finding out a lot more about tea production from blogs written by tourists who visited other factories,which I find very sad. Honestly I fail to understand the added value of taking the tour. You can simply stroll through the countless tea fields above the factory (with better views) and later enjoy a nice cup of tea at a restaurant while reading about tea production on wikipedia.

The building structure is unique and as explained by my Friend Nadun Madushan, the Assistant Manager, it is built in the style of an Chocolate Factory. In order to maintain a high standard of quality, tea manufacturing is done only during the night when the weather is colder. Therefore, the action is very low during the day time. But don't be worried there are plenty of staff who are well trained to take you on a guided tour on how tea is manufactured. Due to security reasons the management doesn't allow anyone to take photographs inside the premises. Their tea boutique is also a very cozy place to visit and have a nice cup of tea and purchase whatever the flavor you wish to have.

But there was no machine on to show the rolling, the fermentation, or the cutting etc. After seeing the sorting, we saw the packaged product ready for auction, then  it was back to the shop for a cup of their tea but no explanation of what we were drinking etc. So a pretty short and basic tour of the factory with a commentary that hard to hear at the best of times, but was inaudible when the sorting machine was on.

Maybe not as grand or as big as some of the other factories, but our experience was excellent. Some days the factory is not in full production and this is due to the weather. When it is full and raining the tea leafs are not growing and therefore are not being picked. It was in half operation when we were there, and the lady who escorted us around for almost an hour was excellent. She advised she was the daughter of parents who had also worked at this factory for many years. She had been there for more than 8 years working also, and had climbed the ladder to a tour guide supervisor. There is a 250lkr  entry fee and that covers the tour and a cup of tea at the end. The lady clearly explained in very good English the full process while taking us through the different drying, rolling, and sorting rooms of the factory. She welcomed our many questions. A worker at the factory or in the field does an 8 hour shift and gets paid 850lkrs for that shift. All workers at this factory live in company provided housing, so while the pay is very low in comparison to most western countries, the workers we spoke to are very happy to have steady work and a roof over their heads.

The factory is full of the most original machinery much of which is still in operation today, so if you are a lover of this sort of thing, you would definitely enjoy a visit. I was surprised at how quickly tea leaves are turned into tea, within 24 hours and that the aluminium lined bags they pack the tea into at the end of the process can keep the tea for upto 2 years. The estate announces that it is an ethical company with some opportunity for the workers to be involved and would appear to offer more medical care and education than some others do.

This tour, which took around 2 hours touches on most of the those topics. Having been warmly received in a very modern facility, we were each given a gown to wear and ushered off in a small group tour of the facility. This starts with learning about the picking process and the pickers, moves to the drying and a discussion about what makes each type or grade of tea, to the rolling, sorting and packing. Our tour guide was a 4 th generation lady who was excellent and handled even the toughest question with an interesting answer. We liked her a lot as it was obvious what she was doing mattered to her.

After the ladies pluck the young tea leaves (the men do other heavier work, apparently), they are delivered to the factory. The machines they use to dry, roll, grind, and grade the tea are more than 80 years old. Quite a miracle. You get full access to all areas of production - but no photos inside. Pedro says it's an ethical company - they don't use chemicals, give all 1300 employees housing and have funds for medical benefits and schooling for the children of the staff. We bought a mixed box of six teas there for 1700 rupee which you can only get at the plantation. The rest is sent to Colombo for auction.
