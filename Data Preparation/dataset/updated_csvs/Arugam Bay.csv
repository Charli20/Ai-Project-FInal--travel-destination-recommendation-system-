However I was there not even in peak season and the amount of people in the water was just ridiculous, something like 70 guys at any moment… There were at least 3-4 guys on every wave, crashes every 15 min and locals mindlessly dropping in and screaming at everyone. I don’t really care about localism that bad and sort of understand it but this was just them ruining the experience for everyone that wasn’t paying them for “clases”. One local guy tried to fight me in the water after claiming I purposely was aiming to run over him with the board, keep in mind there were at least 4 others around him (I didn’t even touch or scratched him when “running him over”).

Even though I knew it was not the peak season in the east of the country,I never expected it to be so quiet. I think it was a combination of being off season and Covid, that had the place looking like a ghost town.  There were very few restaurants and bars open while we were there and the streets were deserted after 8pm. It didnt help that there were power cuts also happening and lots of places had no electricity, which made it eerie walking home in the darkness. In saying all that, we stayed in the Spice trail which was a great choice and the people were very friendly. They also arranged a safari trip to Kumana park, which is only a 45 min journey away and we saw lots of animals, with very little other people around. The beach is a real working beach with lots of fishing boats along the shore constantly going in and out with their catches. So dont expect a beach with lovely stretches of sand with plenty of sun loungers. Its not that type of beach. I would certainly like to visit again when its peak season, to really see this place at its best and then make a better judgement.","April 7, 2022",0.0,0.0

It truly is a surfer’s paradise, with a main point in Arugam Bay itself and various others within 15-20 minutes by Tuk Tuk. We spent most of our time at Whiskey Point as that was where the swell was best — we visited in early June. The beach is also spacious at that point and offers a lot of room to throw a towel down and swim/surf. Not much else though so would not recommend to stay near there. Arugam Bay is definitely where it’s at as there are restaurants/cafes and a few bars. Some points to make: This destination is about surfing, yoga and chilling. There’s waves for all kinds of riders and many day trips on offer - safari, jungle, etc. It’s crucial to go during the right season though. I imagine most restaurants and places are closed otherwise, which would be a shame as you’d not get to explore this lovely place for what it is - a dream for many travelers! There’s not much of a beachfront; it’s filled with boats and so you probably won’t spend much time laying on the beach in A Bay. This didn’t bother us as we were busy surfing and then catching a break in the room mid day. But I can see some people putting up a fuss over this so figured it’s worth a mention. If you want to sunbathe a lot, stay somewhere with a pool. The mornings and evenings are lovey but it does get pretty hot & sweaty in the afternoon. Do yourself a favor and make sure you get a room with A/C. Nothing like being able to chill out in a cool room after a busy morning out on the beach or riding around. The area is predominantly Muslim so there are a lot of limitations on alcohol availability. You can’t get beer or hard alcohol at that many places - maybe 3 to 4 spots along the main strip. Only one bottle shop with actual hard liquor (down a road at the end of Arugam Bay where there is a holiday inn sign) and one with beer (Meena’s) to buy your own. I’d suggest packing a bottle if you wanna enjoy drinks in your room or whatever where you’re staying. Def places to grab cocktails though so no sweat if you just want a rum and coke here and there. This is something I wish I knew in advance - def would’ve liked to have my own supply for my room and by the pool in the afternoon or evening! That being said, Arugam Bay is cheap and the cocktails will only cost you like $3-$5 at the bars that have them so you can drink to your heart’s desire even on a budget. Hideaway Resort’s Bar has great cocktails. Spice Trail bar has wine and bubbles (by the bottle) - both are next to each other. Last thing: we split our stay between two places .. Bay Vista, with a beach view and balcony .. and Spice Trail, which had a pool. This was such a good combo. We loved sitting on our balcony and enjoying the beach views for a few days. But it was equally enjoyable to go for a refreshing dip in the pool when we moved resorts. Both in the best location as well. All in all, we had an awesome trip with loads of surfing & lots of down time to chill and read. It’s a very mellow and chilled out place so definitely go expecting that kinda vibe. Happy surfing 🏄 Also, photo attached for transport service we used. Very comfortable and efficient for journey to Arugam from Colombo. Sanju is a great guy!","June 13, 2019",0.0,0.0

Surf was good for intermediates like us and I personally found the locals in the surf friendly (just don’t jump on their wave-common surf sense). Board hire from Raphs was great, staff give good break tips. There are real coffee shops!!! and lots of restaurants to pick from. Locals will ask if you need a tuktuk, to eat at their restaurant, come surfing with their tour or even just say hello. . Remember, things are pretty slow for these guys atm. We were just polite and said hello, no thank you,no thank you, and walked on. We never felt pushed into anything tho. Tips-there are some nice places to stay at, some with character too! Prices are somewhat negotiable atm, so you could rock up and walk around or if not, I’d recommend somewhere on the beach, then you can use their deck chairs for free. We just brought a smoothie each day at the restaurant near the main break and used their chairs. That worked also. Surfing? Booties could be handy, as there is a few metres of coral on the walk out at the main break but we didn’t have any and all good.","May 27, 2019",0.0,0.0

We found the town very commercial, very catered for tourists - which is fine. There are some lovely restaurants with great local food dishes and some really nice (basic) rooms. Many facilities here are overpriced because of this being a tourist hotspot, but that is to be expected. Tuk Tuk drivers can be very full on - and annoying - when they don’t take ‘no’ for an answer and they overcharge horrendously. Most places are in walking distance so don’t give in to the pressure unless you need to go out of town. It’s cheaper to hire a bike or moped for those journeys. What is truly awful, however, is I was groped on the main part of the beach by some young local lads. They came over, looking like they want to shake hands and welcome us. One shook my hand and then grabbed my chest, before laughing and walking away. It was disgusting, I was shocked and distressed and didn’t know what to do. They were old enough to know better and at the end of the day, they just freely sexually assaulted someone in broad daylight! I was already feeling uncomfortable as the men tend to leer and watch tourist women very closely - and I’m not meaning when they’re in bikinis or swimwear. Just generally. So this is a warning to girls and women - please take care, avoid being out alone and especially walking on the beach or when it’s dark. It really isn’t a pleasant experience and is treated as a joke by the men doing this.","May 14, 2019",0.0,0.0

Surfwise expect a slightly above average wave with 100-300 drunk idiots in the lineup on main point with 0 etiquette from dusk till dawn. All the other spots within 30 minutes are mobbed as well. Some like Peanut Farm and Whiskey Point even have lessons block everyone from surfing in whose not taking a lesson. The worst problem is greed from the local populace. I switched rooms to the Spice Trail and paid only to have them up bill me another $40 a night over what we originally agreed due (and paid) to a ""misunderstanding"". We we're offered free wine and charged for it. I was offered a 10% discount and only given a $10 discount on an almost $200 room, and was originally told one check out time and told another the day I had to leave. The Banana surf shop in Arugam Bay gave us a broken board where the repair job came off in the water and then tried to charge me for the cost of a new board. We eventually negotiated our payment down to $110 but it was still very aggravating and was made worse by the fact that the owner actually was threatening my wife. This low level of business ethics is to be expected in Arugam Bay. Much of these businesses only operate from April-October and the locals all come out en masse to try to ring every penny they can out of the tourists. While some of this is to be expected it becomes harassment when you're walking down the street with multiple Tuk Tuk drivers following you and yelling constantly. Of course the sidewalk collapsed as well and my ankle was severely hurt (maybe broken). On a plus side the food here is great. Lots of variety. Main beach is pretty if somewhat unsurfable. And there's cool spots to surf/visit if you go at least 45 minutes outside Arugam Bay. The wildlife safaris though a bit ghetto will allow you see great wildlife. If you come over here I'd recommend staying in Panama or some place at least 30 minutes outside of Arugam Bay then maybe visiting at night for a meal by Tuk Tuk. It will save you a lot of hassles.","July 6, 2018",0.0,0.0

The beach is littered with nice little bars and restaurants. There are loads of places to eat, drink and stay in Arugam Bay. Try Ranga’s beach hut at the far end to stay, Matahari Secret Garden for a romantic drink, and Bambino’s for a quick but super tasty bite to eat.

Also at these places if you behaved like most people do at A-bay you would quickly get put in your place by locals who realise that surfing etiquette is in place for a reason to keep everyone safe. It is great to see surfing learners having fun and picking up a great new sport. However maybe some of the surf schools should provide more time on etiquette so everyone can get there share of waves (there are plenty!) Instead of having 1) heroes who show off and snake everyone to get the best takeoff zone and then; 2) frustrated everyone else's including learners who then want to drop in/fall off (falling off is fine if you have right of way!!). I just saw too many injuries, banged up boards and dangerous scenarios to even consider surfing there again. It was f@#*king chaos.

Locals are quite friendly. The beach: Whether it's swimming in areas crowded by the local tourists, jumping in the waves in more private beaches, surfing or learning to surf, there's something for everyone somewhere along the coast. Beginner surfers are advised to take a 15 minute tuk-tuk ride from the main strip area to a spot called 'Whisky Point.' While we were told by some that this recommendation is also based on giving more business to tuk-tuk drivers, 'Whisky Point' is indeed quite a good spot for beginner surfers. Waves are still fairly strong, but not too dangerous; also, the area has a sand bottom as opposed to a rock bottom. Best to get there for around 7 a.m. as it could get crowded later in the day. The prices to rent surf boards and boogie boards are quite reasonable and you can probably negotiate prices if you feel like you're given an unreasonable price (especially if you're a foreign tourist). There's plenty of surf shops and prices of the one we went to (Hang Ten or something like that, with a guy named Raji) was quite good and the customer service was great. In the coast along the main strip area, if you just want to spend time in the shade, you can just purchase a beverage (overpriced!) from the multiple huts along the beach and hang out in the shade. The food: Your experience with the food scene depends on the places you go to. We went to a place called Water Edge a couple of times and the food and service was quite good. You could find cheaper places to eat, but the food at this place was quite tasty. Try the seafood platter which is about Rs.1500/= and is one of the more expensive items on the menu. Most restaurants also have vegetarian options; make sure to specify what kind of vegetarian you are, because some add egg to the food even if you say you're vegetarian.","April 23, 2018",0.0,0.0

The beach itself is not bad but at this time of the year (the season starts in March according to the locals) is absolutely deserted. This might sound quite nice at first but the sea here is extremely tough. Considering myself a decent swimmer and bodysurfer, I gave it some good tries but this ever-raging ocean is no fun and very unforgiving. There are a few things to see around here, but as soon as you get out of the tourist bubble you’ll merely find yourself in very poor quarters inhabited by the locals — the effects of the tsunami are still very much present here. For us this meant having a slight feeling of guilt for staying there. The food being served here earns 5 stars, always fresh, always extremely tasty and authentic. It’s a bit harder to buy or get alcohol than other places and the prices differ a lot, definitely watch out for that. Probably just the wrong time to be here.","January 29, 2018",0.0,0.0

Commencing from Kandy, taking the A4 motorway, -through 18hair pin bends up to Mahiyangana and from there, to Bibile-Monaragala-Siyambalanduwa- and through the Lahugala national park border, reached Pothuwil town. The entire journey from Kandy to Pothuwil took about 5 ½ hours.  First, I went to Comari which was 14km away from Pothuwil town and 17km from Arugambay. On my way back to Arugambay I visited the “Whisky point” which is another surfing point within the bay. Arugam -bay is a quite a large bay, curved from the coast line of the Indian Ocean where the main tourist area as well as the key surf point is commonly called Arugam bay. This location is predominantly a fishing village where fishing boats are parked along the beach behind most of the hotels, inns and shallays alongside the beach side. It is this area along the arugmbay road, that you can find most of the hotels, inns, eating joints, road side restaurants and various activities which make the entire arugam  bay road alive when darkness falls. It is the off season for this beautiful bay. Why we call it the “off season” is because, from the beginning of this month the rolling waves most suitable for surfing start diminishing . The sea becomes calm where those people who love sun and sand and a dip in the sea, the environment is ideal. The hustle bustle in the tourist area will come to a low end but for those who likes a bit of a peaceful environment and not much interested in surfing its ideal. May be the small waves forming in the whisky point would be suitable for learners of surfing . The mornings are quite warm and the temperature goes over 30 degrees Celsius but the afternoon hours are cloudy and even you can experience slight rain. The sea is calm and ideal for a dip in the water for guys who love sun and sand. Most of the beaches in the bay are quite clean and nice. As the room rents during this season comes down drastically, guys who wish to have a quiet holiday at budget rates ,this season would be a good selection but not for surfing. Lets talk about Comari and Whiskey point. Comari is a quiet place where there are few lodging places for tourists. As it is only 14km from the Arugambay, one who hires motor bike or get a tuk tuk it would be cheaper to stay in Comari and vist Arugmbay on daily basis to have fun. If not, it is not difficult to find a place to lodge in Arugambay itself during this period as you get only few tourists and surfers there. For a person who is interested about other attractions, the famous bird sanctuary “Kumana” national  park is only 28 km from Pothuwil town. If you hire a Safari jeep, it may cost you between 10 to 15 USD to proceed to “Kumana” and come back to Arugambayin the evening.  The Lahugala national park is also in close proximity to Pothuwil town where it would be the same rate or less to travel in the morning and return in the evening. Ofcourse, I really enjoyed my stay in Comari and Arugam-bay during this off season which paved the  way for a budget stay for me.","October 26, 2017",0.0,0.0

Take antiseptic with you amd be prepared to propeely clean out the wond it will hurt but it wont get infected. Or alternatively use a lime like in Barley!

So to help the women out that are in desperate need, arugam bay in the centre has a supermarket, called food (something) can't recall but they stock tampons. Of course for an extortionate price (980 Rupee) but, if in need this will be your life saver haha. Hope fully this helps! ...It's in the centre across from a hostel, next to an Aussie swimwear store.

Bay for a week of surfing. We're about a week early before the season officially starts but we're getting good waves already. The benefit of being outside of season is it is much quiter than it will be in a few weeks. We wish we were here a month ago! There is a good vibe about the place as restaurants and guest houses are just opening up. This also gives visitors greater bargaining power for cheaper room rates, tuk rides and food. Be aware that this place gets mental busy during Sri Lankan piblic holidays. We were here during Vesak (buddhas birthday) and hundreds of Sri Lankan families turned up to the beach for 2 days straight. Nice to see them having a good time but it was hard to move about on the beach, restaurants were selling out of food, no alcohol was sold for 2 days and the place was trashed with litter afterwards. Overall A Bay has a good vibe but I wouldn't come here if I wasn't a surfer. It's not a nice beach to lay and relax on and there's a lot of ripping off of tourists going on.","May 12, 2017",0.0,0.0

This wide clean beach, with golden sand, is still unspoilt, virgin and utopian.  We strolled along the beach late in the evening and early morning watching the sunset and the sunrise from the eastern coast.  Photographs attached.  We could not swim though during this visit as the sea was still rough at this time of the year. The swim time at the beach is from about June until September/October when the sea is calm.  However, surfers as well as tourists come here in great numbers during that season from all over the world.  I am told that one has to book early to get reasonable accommodation. Arugam Bay is basically a fishing village.  The fishing boats that return in the morning with their catch was a sight I enjoyed and photographed. There are many small to medium hotels here with mid-range restaurants along the road running parallel to the beach and along the beachfront itself. Arugam-bay’s beauty was not accessible until the end of the war in 2009 as the area was under terrorist control.  After the end of the war both local and foreign tourists flock here to bask in the beauty of this beach. Since we were there only for one night we could not explore the surrounding areas.  It is my intention to return during the June – September season for an extended stay with a few visits to the surrounding temples and the Kumana National Park only 10km from here.","April 14, 2017",0.0,0.0

The weather was ok (some rain but expected) but what we really didn't like was that there was so much litter at the beach, we wonder if that's also the case during on season. Also the beach doesn't offer any bars and restaurants which are all located on the street. Another problem was that many restaurants and bars are closed during off season. I maybe suspect that Arugam Bay is a nice beach during on season but during off season there are other beaches better suitable to relax (for example Hikkaduwa and Merissa).","November 17, 2016",0.0,0.0

Only thing is you must select the correct season to visit if you are really interested in Surfing. Although, throughout the year you have reasonably enough waves here, during the season you will find everything perfect including the weather conditions for Surfing. Early months and Last Two months of the each year are normally considered as off-season but accommodations and foods become very cheap during these months. You can find a small beach front room (without A/C) for about Rs. 1,000. If you are not a budget traveler, don't worry, you have well established hotels with star ratings offering 50%-60% discounts during this period. Rain will be the main enemy of any traveler during this period and normally they expects thunderstorms every evening specially in April. The beach also becomes bit unclear due to the rain in off season. Beach may become fairly crowded during weekends, with locals specially in April as it is a school vacation month in Sri Lanka. After July or in some years late June, foreigners start filling the rooms and restaurants in all the corners of this area. When it becomes the winter season to Australia/New Zeelands, quite a lot of Ausis can be found in the streets. The busiest period really starts by August, which is considered as the best time to Surf. You will get the best waves for Surfing during this period and it will last until mid or may be end of October. If you were lucky enough to be there during these months, you can find plenty of Surfers in the beach and if you are new to Surfing, don't worry, you can catch a trainer with all equipment at a reasonable prices. I was told that one hour session would cost only Rs. 2,000 including a trainer and Surfing Board. Almost all the restaurants and hotels have international menu and Thai, Italian and Chinese foods are well famous in this area. You can have a very small taste of local foods and culture in this area specially during the peak season. Anyway, trust me you will not have to be in hungry, as you have a wide range of foods available from Pizza to Fried Rice. Arugam Bay is about 200 km away from Capital and if you are a backpacker you have enough transport options. If you have all your Surfing Boards and other big bags, you will have to hire a vehicle which may be bit expensive. Ampara is the nearest main city but you can find several small town thereafter like Akkaraipattu and Pothuwil. From Colombo there is a bus going to Arugam Bay every night sharp at 9.00 pm. It will reach Its destination by next morning and stop one time for tea. This is a a luxury bus with AC and you will be charged Rs. 1,200 one way. On your way back also bus will leave Arugam Bay by 9.00 pm and reach to Colombo by next morning. After visiting many of the beaches in Sri Lanka, I cannot say that Arugam Bay is the best beach in Sri Lanka but it can be considered as the best destination for Surfers. If you have enough time don't miss this attraction, go there and fill another seat in a crowded restaurant.","October 18, 2016",0.0,0.0

So definitely clean your cuts out everyday until fully healed! The town itself was pretty busy and akin to other westernised Asian countries, bars blaring out loud music till all hours of the morning on the weekends. We had a car so stayed a few miles out of town for most of the trip in Papermoon which was very nice and also staying on the point at Upalis was an awesome experience! Also there are some great restaurants in Arugam Hideaway and thaththas roti shop were by far the highlights! The local wildlife is incredible drive a km out of town at sunrise and sunset and you will see dozens of elephants crocodiles and amazing bird life! Lagoon Safari is a must!

A nice long beach, surfing and surf lessons, but swimming was also possible as long as you're OK getting through the waves. However a lot of the eating places seemed to be over-stretched, with slow service, poor food, and high prices for what you get. The atmosphere in general was more ""international backpacker"" rather than particularly Sri Lankan.

Safaris are also arranged but you will get to see plenty of elephants during tuktuk rides for free. And crocodiles too if you go to panama.

Also, the cabanas have a small frontyard where our hosts put up a hammock especially for us. Definitely try to catch your room there! What we also really liked here was siam view, (they have delicious food) and hideaway (great superfood drinks during daytime, nice cocktails and drinks during nighttime). At hideaway is also the best hairdresser you will ever meet here and they have a market on sundays. Only one thing clouded our short stay in arugam bay, which was dizzys surf school. At first the guys were really nice and friendly,offering us surf lessons for good conditions, incl. Transport and surfboard. We took two lessons in total, where both surf teachers showed up.to the first, but only one turned up to the second lesson. Then we went there 3 times to pay the lessons but dizzy was not available. Still, a few days after he sent two guys to our cabana to collect the money from us. But not the fixed amount, but more than double the price we agreed on first time! Also while discussing, one of the guys treated us absurdly disrespectful, telling us that he does not want to hear our ""bla bla"" and that he has got something better to do than listening to complaining customers.","August 4, 2015",0.0,0.0

Other breaks in the area include Whiskey Point and Pottuvil Point to the north, and Elephant Rock, Peanut Farm and Okanda to the south.

The camp is a nice setup with bean bags, hammocks and nice wall are, and they also have a collection of surf movies to watch at night. Food is made by Gallage and I always loved his stuffed calamari served with rice. Overall, the camp experience is totally worth the money you pay for!","March 21, 2015",0.0,0.0

Such an amazing country and so many great experiences. The biggest let down was Arugam Bay. As an experienced 27 yr old surfer I was looking forward to this part of our travels the most.  I have surfed in many parts of the world and rented boards from all over with no issue. Ocean Surf is said to have the best name to rent boards but from my encounter I did not experience this. I rented an old fish board for $9 for the day. Before renting went over the board and was happy all issues were pointed out. After a great few waves at Whisky point I returned the board in the late afternoon. Upon returning the board me and the owner quickly went over it but he was more interested in talking about the surf I had (diversion?) and with this was my mistake, not going over the board in as much detail as in the morning. I walked out the shop and started to make my way down the street. I was chased by the owner producing this ""miracle"" damage on the board.The damage was a large ding that had cracked the fibreglass (the type of damage anyone would know that they had done and something that slaps you in the face its that obvious). After surrounding me with a number of his mates and a lot of back and forth I was forced to pay about $72 to fix this damage. These stories are all to common in Arugam Bay and unfortunately it was my turn after a perfect run. Avoid OCEAN SURF rentals! Arugam Bay it's self is a bit try hard with the majority of locals there for the beach lifestyle and to try and pick up the fe male tourists. The service is terrible in most of the places and it was not uncommon to wait over an hour for a order to arrive. The only exception was staying at the Hideaway. Great accom, friendly service and the food was amazing. The Hideaway is the only place to stay in my opinion and after talking with many other tourists at the time they agreed and switched to the hideaway.","September 23, 2014",0.0,0.0

I've travelled all over Asia this being one of my last stops and I was disgusted at the greed that has taken the locals here. Just coming from Bali, Indonesia - the most touristy surf destination in Asia - i was shocked at how much the restaurants and guest houses and even tuk tuk drivers attempt to charge tourists in Arugam Bay. We're talking at least 4-5 dollars for the simplest of meals up to 12 for a decent one, when in Bali i could get absolutely fantastic meals for 2-3 dollars at most. Beers in Bali are cheaper even though they have a tax. When I was in Colombo beers were half the price they are in Arugam Bay, and food was a third of the price. Accommodation and transport is also overpriced. I've also heard from fellow travellers that they've been ripped off in certain board rental shops. Not impressed, if I was gonna spend that much money I would have stayed in Bali another month. The crowd on the main point is also pretty big and not many people seem to understand the etiquette of surfing, bad vibes all round really.","September 22, 2014",0.0,0.0

Seems to be Hasan's business strategy to charge people extrem high prices for board repair in case of damage to a rented board. I was charged 3000 for a 1 cm scratch and my friend 7000 for a small cut as well. When we tried to negociate he became very agressive saying that if we dont pay now we should repair it on our own and if the board wasnt ready the next morning he would charge an extra day board rental. He did not even want to give the passport back in the end. There are many otherboard shops so dont rent your board at this location! You are never sure not to damage a rented board and hasan will try to make you pay even for superficial scratches.

We go for the surfing and laid back lifestyle, we always enjoy ourselves and stay at the Danish Villa.  There are some things that continue to disturb me about this sleepy surfing town.  One main thing is that single girls are not safe here by themselves despite a military and heavy police presence which seems to dominate more each year we come.  The tuk tuk drivers are lame and will offer you drugs despite most of them being part of the muslim faith and they dominate the taxi services and stop other cheap options and information about those options.  We again were scammed by taxi drivers coming from the airport to Colombo and endured a terrifying overland trip to A bay with very bad driving and no seats belts.  When leaving we had a trusted local man buy us bus tickets and get us a tuk tuk for 3 people for $11 to Akkaraipattu bus stand, nearly an hour north of A bay on a quiet and enjoyable road and caught a first class air conditioned overnight coach with room for surfboards to Colombo, it gets in about 5 am and there is little traffic in Colombo then, which is good as it is a hectic place - you wont see any advertising about this bus service.  When we were in Sri Lanka we hired a scooter from a guy up near Why Not restaurant and for $10 a day and then it got heaps cheaper each day we had it and it was fun scootering around and checking out locals towns and sights nearby, be careful about riding later in the afternoon though as the wild elephants are around.

I didn't mind this and was happy to swim and look forward to eating out later....I wish I hadn't. I found the service generally slow and indifferent and the food sadly below par for Sri Lanka ( it had been excellent in Kandy). Many of the restaurants do not have liqour licences and you wont be even able to get a cold beer. If its a full moon it becomes a bank holiday and you will not be served alcohol ANYWHERE. If you are a surfer you will love this place. If you want to eat , relax and socialise look elsewhere.

Arugam Bay is one of the TOP 10 surf points in the world. It is also a sandy beach of stunning natural beauty. Arugam Bay's proximity to Lahugala National Park & Yala East National Park makes it a unique surfing beach. The bay lies between two headlands & is excellent for surfing. Arguam bay is located 320 km from Colombo. Some 60km due east from Monaragala, Arugam Bay is a tiny fishing village 3km south of the small fishing village of Pottuvil which is at the remote southern end of the Eastern coast & on the edge of Yala East National Park. The wide, sweeping sandy beach in front of the fishing village is an attraction for swimming all year-round. The beach is usually deserted, except at the southwest corner. In the South west corner, fishing boats & thatch huts indicates the  tiny fishing village of Ulla, just to the south of the guest house area. Also this is also the safest area for swimming with a water temperature of 24-28 centigrade year-round, where you don't need a wet suit to swim or surf in this waters. As far as the techniques of surfing is concerned, 'The Point' in Arugam Bay is regarded as one of the  top world surf destinations. It is a well lined up right hand point break, generating a clean peeling glassy wave that barrels a surfer, a 400 meter ride right through to the inside of the wave. Additionally there are four or five high quality breaks within a radius of 30 minutes. Pottuvil point in the northern end of Arugambay is often deserted. However this area is  popular with more experienced surfers.  Crocodile Rock , 3kms south of Arugam Bay is a long, deserted beach from where wild elephants can quite often be seen. Pottuvil lagoon is a haven for numerous bird species. Arugam Bay's picturesque lagoon divides Ulla village from Pottuvil lagoon, north of town. The bridge is an excellent vantage point to see the sunset, & at night you can watch prawn fishermen throwing, gathering & emptying their nets.","June 10, 2013",0.0,0.0

It took much of the day to reach there, as the roads were B roads, badly maintained, full of snaking twists and turns.The saving grace was the breathtaking scenery: we passed waterfalls, rice paddies, and sleepy vilages and towns until we reached Moneragala, the nearest large town to Pottuvil and the Bay. We had a late lunch at the Rest House there. From here on, it was the war zone, The road was deserted, except for the odd bus and trucks carrying produce. Checkpoints, manned by army mostly , dotted the road.We had to stop and show our IDs inumerable times. From Siyabalanduwa onwards the checkpoints were manned by the Special Task Force, STF, the paramilitary special ops force that policed the East Coast.Tension was in the air. The checkpoint personnel were monosyllabic, surly at times, with red-rimmed eyes, pointing to sleepless nights and a lot of stress.Although the LTTE had not mounted a big operation in the East coast that year, there were small incursions al the time. I drunk it all in-the tension went hand in hand with the dark green foliage of the dense forests on either side of this road. If we got blown up on this road, it was all worth it-died on the road to Arugam Bay, chasing a wave, what an epitah, I thought. When we passed Siyambaladuwa, the vegetation began to change.It was no longer wet zone tropical but dry zone, with its spiky foliage, a more yellowish colour, smaller leaves, and sparser.And the heat began to ratchet up.There were landscapes of green rice paddy fields stretching to the horizon on both sides of the road now. Occasionally there were small tractors trundling on the road. More checkpoints. Then we reached Lahugala Forest Reserve, which was by the road, from which one was supposed to see Elephant herds snacking on the lush grass of the tank bed there. We stopped, and there were a couple of Grey Ghosts there. Their trunks swayed as they tore up the grass.It was our first sight of the magic of the jungles here, and well worth the 8-hour drive. It was getting towards dusk, and we had get off this road before the light went. The road now was really bad, pot holed and very small, untouched since the 1950s , it seemed. On both sides were dry paddies and salterns, streching to the horizons. The road didnt allow for a speed in excess of 10 mph:it seemed quicker to walk, but we would probably get shot by the STF, who were probably patrolling out somewhere out there. The final checkpoint was reached, when we got to Pottuvil, the dusty, one road, one horse - million tractor little town which would be immortalised in our minds as Potters. We stopped for a while in Potters, drinking in the sights while slaking our tea habit in a tea boutique. A town of bycycles and tractors, and rusty, beaten up up vans and STF soldiers carrying T-56 automatics. We had stocked up with fresh veggies and food in Moneragala, as wher we were headed to had a cook.There was only one hotel/guest house  in the Bay, the Stardust hich was owned by a Danish couple who had been here ages.But they charged major bucks for rooms.I and two friends, a couple, were going to stay in the run down guest house owned by a family friend. The others, another couple an their teenage son would stay in the Stardust. There was a glorious sunset dying as we crossed the bridge into the Bay.The winds blowing from the sea promised something, maybe crab curries and grilled prawns. The Stardust was immediately identifiable, set back on the left in its neat sandy grounds, a sold white building, with some small cabanas out facing the sea. We were in the Hideaway, a ramshackle old building, hidden away in a mass of Bourganvillea and some scattered coconut trees. It was run by a very dodgy caretaker, who met us smoking a cheroot, dressed in a sarong, and very suspicious of these dusty, sweaty oiks from Colombo, with a white girl in tow. After some preliminary sparring, he agreed to let us stay in the rooms upstairs.There were cabanas, but they were falling down, rat and mosquito infested, he said. The owner of the Hideaway was involved in a court case trying to get rid of the caretaker, who had a reputation of using the place for prostitution and drugs. Arugam bay always had great rep for the best grass in Sri Lanka: I wanted to do some inhaling while I was there, i was all part of the package. Problem-there was no cook:we would have to do our own dinner. Of all of us, I had the most experience of cooking, my friends were in the fry-ups, toast and cereal brigade.I got them slicing and dicing, and we had brought some chicken, which I managed to get into a semblance of a curry. The other layabouts did a salad, and we tucked in after a shower in our rickety rooms, which had  fans and mossie nets. No crabs and prawns tonight, but we were too tired to care, and after dinner we headed of to the Stardust down the road, the night starlit and still. After several ice cold beers,and lots of chat , making plans for the days ahead we called it and staggered back, nearly dissappearing into some of the potholes on the road. I collapsed on my bed, arranging the mossie net as well as I could and left for noddieland. I was woken up suddenly by what seemed to be the apocalypse breaking over the bay.It was World War Three:the bulding was shaking, there were flares lighting up the outside, and I could see tracer fire acing into the night,The noise was horrendous.Convinced I was going to die imminently, I ran next door to where my friends were, and leaped into their room. They were under the bed. I joined them. ""What the hell is going on?"", my pal's English girlfriend yelled, as another mortar seemed to alight in the garden, shaking the paper thin walls. ""I think the Tigers are coming, J-, and I want you to surrender to them, seeing you are a tourist you'll;;be okay and as we are together they wont kill us"" said my pal ,her boyfriend.Always thinking ahead my buddy R-. I really wished I had eaten a crab curry and got hold of some Bay weed tonight:atl east I would have gone out with great memories. I thought of my mum back in Colombo, an all the things I hadnt done yet, the women I hadnt dated yet, the music I hadnt heard, the cars, I hadnt driven, the countries I hadnt been to,a long long Bucket list. Then, as suddenly as it had begun, the fireworks stopped. We crawled out, shaken and well stirred, and looked out at he darkness.The Hideaway had no power anyway, so  it was dark everywhere.No sign of life, no signs of Tigers walking up the path, nothing. The stillness of the night returned, and even the cicadas began to chirp cautiously.It was around 3 am. We opened some scotch to celebrate being alive, and went back to bed. The next morning, we asked the first SF guy we saw what had happened. He laughed, albeit rather hysterically, I thought. ""Oh, that?Nothing to worry about, we were just getting rid of our old ammo stocks before the New year"" he said walking away quickly. Dumbfounded, we looked at each other and chalked it up to more of inimitable Sri Lankan humour. The next few days were idyllic:we pickniked in a green dale beyond which we saw a hoard of copulating turtles, their shells glistening in the sun, saw ancient temples on beaches,saw Elephants and Buffalos together on th roadside, and visited Kudumbigala rock monastery, where the silence of millennia ruled the heights and meditation caves, the haunt of Bear and Leopard. We body surfed in some forgotten cove where the fish nibbled at our toes , and visited deserted, empty beaches running for miles., visited the hushed grandeur of Radella tank, where forest giants stalked the bund. I got my crab curry but no hash, which I got on another trip. Over it all lay the feeling of a frontier, a place forgotten by time and the hordes  of the  20th century. I have been to Arugam bay many times since then,  caught the surf one full moon night,but the world has changed:Gone are the checkpoints, the palpable taste of danger and tension in the air,Gone too are most of the Elephants. But Kudumbigala monastery remains the same, human history nothing but a blip in its millennial count, its caves a silent reminder of eternity. The Hideaway is now a thriving resort, famous for its food, and the Stardust is still there,, although the Danish Manager was swept away in the  grea Tsunami of 2003. There are a host of small hotels and guesthouses, and the surfing is now on global to-do lists by all surfers.The jungles are still there, now dwindling sadly.The 21st century has come to the Bay. But the feeling of a frontier is still there,although our experience was quite special.Perhaps you have to be Sri Lankan to realise we saw a frontier just before it began to change. When what we got couldnt be charged to a credit card or to a wad of dollars. To paraphrase  the Roman Pliny we ""watched the cold star Saturn, and saw honey come out of the air at the rising of the Dog-star just before the dawn.""

And when the landlady saw us with our luggage ready to leave, after all this, she was only able to ask us to go and pay the bill, without any excuse. So as a conclusion it was a bad experience.","April 17, 2013",0.0,0.0

We knew it was out of season but thought that was based purely on the weather. The weather looked ok so we paid a visit. The sea and beach were both unpleasant, just a bit dirty to be honest, and as it was out of season most places were shut so it seemed like a ghost town. It felt like there was some sort of unrest going on. It gave us an uneasy feeling. As I say if you're planning to visit check it's in season and try to gather info from a like minded traveller or T.Ad. Before making the long journey as we did. We only stayed a night and traveled 14hrs over two days to be hugely disappointed. Also the Lonely Planet warns against travel to this area for single women. We were traveling as a couple (male and female) and my girlfriend felt really uncomfortable. This area seems to be a Muslim area and without generalising about all Muslim men my girlfriend felt she was being stared at a great deal. And she was dressed conservatively not like a a teenager with a thong bikini! We have travelled many places so this opinion is based on other experiances we have had over years with some strong Muslim connections. Maybe this problem was what the Lonely Plant were touching on but were being politically correct so didn't spell it out. This experiance wasn't totally in your face but it was there all the same. It's the most uncomfortable place we've been to in Sri Lanka and was very unlike the usual local/tourist relationships. This is how we saw it anyway. I'm sure others would see things differently. Carefully consider your visit here. I wish I had.","February 10, 2013",0.0,0.0

During the first trip we stayed at the Danish villa in 2010 and this time in 2012 we are (writing this whilst in Arugambay) at the Siam View.  Both locations are great places to stay.  The area has developed in the last 2 years and has many coffee shops, shopping and eating places.  The surfing shops seem to be attracting tourists in large numbers.  The beach is great and safe for the kids.  We missed the sunrise due to the clouds but everyone had an early morning beach stroll while the fishermen were busy at sea getting their daily catch to the shore. However, I want to warn the local (sri lankan) ladies that might get tempted visiting shops in here where they seem to encourage only the foriegners.  Unfortunatlye, 4 of us ladies  and 4 kids in the 9-15 age range went in to the shop named ""Forcus"" which is across from the Siam Vew and was browsing what they had to offer in the 3 or 4 different types of shops they own.  When we walked in to the third one that was a clothes shop, the store owner walked up to us and in the best English possible said ""do not go in there, these prices are for foreigners"" in a very derogatory manner. When the ladies questioned, he became very angry and was very rude and said he can do what ever he wants since it is his store.  He was very loud and all the bystanders were in shock.  Ofcourse we then went our way and when were coming back to the hotel, he crossed the road over to start arguing with us again. Besides this incident, so far it has been a great vacation and I hope that this shop owner (and others with this mentality) realise the importance of us locals whom they depend  on during off season and when occupancy rates are low.","September 2, 2012",0.0,0.0

Great beach for surfing with a giant sand bar separating the surfing beach and mainland, giving a great swimming area for children inbetween. This is great for families who want to surf but need someone for younger children to swim. The surfing waves did get busy late afternoon but it was quiet early in the morning. It is easy to rent surf boards or body boards (around rps 500 for 24 hours) and tuk tuk are a plenty to visit some of the other places to surf. On the negative side we had a bad experience with groups of young men fighting (very violently!) on the beach near the point one afternoon. It went on for quite awhile, and people with young children were unable to leave the beach without passing through what was happening (we were able to swim away with our children across the lagoon). Eventually, the army (who have a permanent presence on this beach) called for reinforcements and things calmed down, leaving shocked (and crying foreigners) on the beach. We thought it was all over but the next morning at 8am two groups of young men were arguing again but it resolved itself quickly. Locals we spoke to played the whole incident down saying it was just the youngsters getting out of hand and it was nothing but it was a frightening experience for us and we did wonder if this was why the army and tourist police are permanently based on the beach. Maybe this was a one off and we were unlucky to be there as we had seen no other trouble for the 5 days we had been there before, but were glad to leave the tensions behind when we moved on.","July 30, 2012",0.0,0.0

The main season for Augam Bay is from May to November when the predominant wind is offshore for at least the first half of the day. Arugam Bay is situated about 350 Km away to the east coast of Sri Lanka from the Katunayeka Bandaranayeka International Airport. There are two three different ways to travel there. One easy road is from Airport to Colombo and then to Rathnapura. From Rathanapura to Kolabageara and through Udawalawa Dam to Thanamalwilla then turn towards Wallawaya after Turn towards Monaragala and then Siyabalanduwa now proceeds to Potuwill. The other road is through Rathnapura and Ella, Wallawaya to Manaragala. This is very scenic road and there are lots of eye catching views to stop. Also the  other remaining ways are From airport to Awissawella, Hatton, Nuwara Eliya through to Monaragala and then Arugam Bay. This road also has lot of breath taking views to see but rather mountainous road so it is harder to drive. If you are travelling in night leave the 2nd and 3rd ways use the 1st road.

On a travellers budget, of course. Although saying that I did stay in some high end hotels and I still would put 'Hideaway' up there!)  We had an air conditioned room, which was perfect. The staff were so very friendly (not overly so though - afterall, I am English! ;-)). The food was excellent! It is run by a Sri Lankan lady who appears to know exactly what the good things in life are. Somewhere chilled to relax, clean and with great service. I am a real foodie, so that fresh food was a real hit for me. She also gave us some excellent tips. -Safari - we saw a leopard - I was over the moon! This however can be really hit and miss. I drew on quite a lot of reviews before I went travelling so wanted to provide something vaguely useful too. If I were to do this trip again I would probably miss out Negombo and spend a bit more time in the Hill Country. I enjoy a good view and a nice beach and this holiday had exactly that. In a bid to manage your expectations however be ware that Sri Lanka is not easy to travel around. The best way is to hire a driver. But you do need to haggle.

SL seems to be a bit rip-off these days, compared with our last trip here in 2004, with silly prices for food and accommodation, especially in the south, south-east and near the ""safari"" zones.  But Arugam bay restored our faith. It's one of the last refuges of backpackers in the country (along with crazy hikkaduwa) and we had a real relaxing time here mixed with some exciting cycling journeys along the coast towards Panama village. We stayed at Beach Hut, always busy even out of season, we learned. Cheap rooms and genuinely great food. The main beach area is not the tropical beauty of, say, Thailand or malaysia, but that's more or less the case for all of sri lanka where the waves are generally enormous (ok if you're a surfer) and the beaches steep, not to mention strewn with plastic rubbish. Arugam beach was also a fishing beach which, apart from the inevitable scattered rubbish, made it all the more interesting. Nearby trips can be made to Pottuvil town and, further north, Pottuvil point, a popular surfer hangout in season but almost completely empty when we visited. Be careful swimming here due to currents from the lagoon (even if it looks very picturesque). Also Panama village, south of arugam, is possible by bicycle or tuktuk where the journey itself is great, rather than the village which is ok for some food and drinks. An English guy has bought up the land encompassing the point so the current peace may or may not change in future. at the moment there is only a restaurant and a few basic huts at the point itself but I guess this is a busy place in surfing season. The caretaker, sidike, is a wealth of local info and good company for a chat. it's a lonely job he has!

Of my four-week round travel in Sri Lanka with my two young children, this place - it's beautiful aesthetics, loving attention to detail, superior food and incredibly kind and helpful owner Sharon and her staff; all culminating in creating the most enjoyable and relaxed, tranquil and peaceful atmosphere - stayed with us and would most certainly be the one to come back to. The bed and breakfast centers around the owner's old family holiday home, set back from the beach across the main road. The property consists of the main house and 6 or 7 bungalow-style units amidst a luscious, palm-tree adorned and color-kissed garden. The downstairs veranda style set-up of the main house functions as the reception, restaurant and open-air living-room - complete with old cupboards full of books, big rattan chairs and stone benches atopped with bright-colored cushions inviting you time and again to sink in and relax - all in one. Upstairs, enjoying a wide and beautiful balcony are a few rooms for rent. The bungalows come in various sizes. We stayed in one of the newer ones, which was a spacious (humongous bed and bathroom), minimalistic, clean - simply gorgeous unit. Arugam Bay is a small village on Sri Lanka's south-eastern coast, which has become a (family)-surfer's heaven. The main street is lined with one bed&breakfast  - some bigger hotels starting to sprout about, which hopefully will not do too much harm to the very chilled and relaxed, not yet too overcrowded feel of Arugam Bay - cafe, imbiss, restaurant, bar, surfer-boutique and corner-shop next to the other, which makes for perfect beach-holiday strolling and hanging-out: picking up your breakfast before descending on to the gorgeous main beach, which has a few great (mid-)day hang-out spots; sorting yourself with any snacks or beach-wear utensils anytime; enjoying one brilliant dinner after the other during your stay - unless of course Hideaway just keeps tempting you back in - probably the most stressful decision-making aspect during our stay!!! I can only whole-heartedly recommend a stay in Arugam Bay and here at Hideaway!!! ENJOY!!!","September 12, 2011",0.0,0.0

We stayed at Hideaway, an old Dutch colonial house with big wooden verandahs, quaint old features and art work.  The owner has recently returned from living abroad and is lovingly restoring this old family holiday home and the cabanas in the lovely garden.  Some negative reviews I've noticed obviously relate to the former caretaker's management- the owner is refurbishing the rooms and establishing a quiet, cool atmosphere for laid back guests. We certainly had the personal touch and enjoyed great jazz and world music and delicious fusion cooking to order.  [ not cheap but of the highest standard].  I found the upstairs rooms with open fretwork walls, cool but prone to mozzies and, with no sound proofing, not a honeymoon venue! Next time - and we certainly plan to return to our helpful, charming hosts - we will try the cabanas which are being refurbished now.

We were there in February, so it was out of season and the place was very quiet. We stayed the first night at the Beach Hut, which is a lovely hotel if you can get a decent room. However, we had a tiny room in the back, away from the beach, which was Rs.800, but was miserable, as it was infested with bed bugs or something else that bites. I probably only slept a total of an hour the entire night. The food there was great and it has a great atmosphere, though. We were lied to the day we arrived and told we would only have that room for the first night, then would be moved to a nicer one on the beach, which a more honest member of staff informed us the next day, was actually impossible, as they were fully booked. So, we packed up and headed elsewhere. We picked the Surf Resort (formerly Hillton), which was lovely. We had a spacious cabana just off the beach with beautiful views for just Rs.1000 (£5.65) per night. I'm sure rates increase during the surfing season. The food at the Surf Resort was good. We also tried the Siam View Hotel, which was okay for Thai food, and the Stardust Beach Hotel, which was a delicious, but quite pricey meal.

Arugam Bay is famous for surfing. Even though I don't know how to surf, I found this place fasinating because it's got very nice beach and it's such a little village so different from those Singhalese culture dominant towns and sightseeing places on the tourist track. It's a very very very laid-back place, even by Sri Lankan standards, and can be quiet (except for the times when the loud speakers from the mosques calling for prayers) and veyr relaxing.  I didn't surf, but it was good fun just watching the surfers and the fun-loving locals playing with the water. We stayed at Hideaway Guesthouse. It's really a hideaway place - very big and green garden, a cozy and laid-back style lounge at the reception. All very atmaspheric. First night we stayed in one of the non-AC rooms (Rs 4k; dbl) above the reception. The room is simple and comfortable, but a lot of mosquitos - everytime I checked there were 10-15 on the mosquito net (outside). another drawback of these rooms are the top of walls are not ""sealed"", so you can easily hear other people's talking in the next room, or the music from downstairs, or the early morning mosque loud speakers. The corridor outside these rooms have very comfortable couch and cusions, love this part very much. The next night we opted for AC rooms (Rs 7k; dbl) on the 2nd floor of the little house closer to the road. There was very little traffic in Arugam Bay, so it wasn't a problem at all, and no loud speaker could be heard from here. The room was sytlishly decorated and was very very comfortable (and romantic). The A4 road going down to Arugam Bay has just finished upgrading to a nice road in August, so I'm pretty sure Arugam Bay will be back to the tourist map with huge popularity for Sri Lankans and foreigners alike.

It is a bit more expensive than other hotels ($42 night for my room) but it is spotlessly clean, has AC, and the staff is very helpful. The Thai restaurant in town is great and so was the Green Room for Sri Lankan curries. Take a tuk-tuk out of town to surf some less crowded waves or get up very early.  The main peak can be a mob scene at most times.  It is a great wave though.  Bring your own board if possible.

All good fun if the stairs hadn't been fitted wrong with all of the treads sloping downwards at at angle beyond exciting, particularly with a pregnant wife. No real complaints but a bit more effort in preparing the room room, at least emptying the ashtrays would have been welcome. What we really didn't like was the beach. It is a working fishing beach which sounds quite cool but the reality is working beaches are not clean and fishermen are not wealthy so there is never any sensation of being in a desert island paradise, in fact it was all a little bit squalid. What does make it worth a visit though is the journey, particularly from AB into the hills, this made the stop over worth the trip rather than, as is often the case in Sri Lanka, the other way around.
