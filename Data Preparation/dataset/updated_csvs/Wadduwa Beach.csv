It’s extremely dirty (water, sand, foreshore and backstreets), lacking in any sort of beach amenities (two local restaurants along the entire strip), has no discernible attractive features (just a long, straight beach - no reef, no islands, no headlands, no... nothing!), and extremely uninviting from a swimming/surfing point of view (dirty, as mentioned above, muddled surf, and significant rip currents - dangerously so for any but the more experienced). Do yourself a favour and travel a bit further down the coast to Galle and beyond to have a decent beach holiday in Sri Lanka. In closing, I have to offer my deepest sympathy to Sri Lankans following the Easter Sunday bombings, and all the other horrors we’ve experienced in the following days.

I think it was just the time of year we stayed, but the beach was very dirty with lots of trash brought in by the tide. The locals told us the beach is cleaner later in the year. That aside the beach has very few amenities, we walked for about 20 minutes only finding 2 restaraunts on the beach. There are no sun beds on the beach, only in the tourist resorts. It is a very pretty beach if you find a spot without trash, and it's very peaceful as there were no tourists on the beach in our visit. We only met locals on the beach. You can watch the local fisherman at work on the beach which is fun. Galle road is about 5 minutes walk from the beach and has some restaraunts and shops but nothing exciting near the beach.
