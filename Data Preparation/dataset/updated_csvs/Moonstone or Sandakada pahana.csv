At first glance, it’s a beautifully carved semicircle at the entrance of a temple — but once you understand its meaning, it becomes truly powerful. Each ring of the Moonstone represents a stage in the Buddhist cycle of life: birth, aging, death, and rebirth. It’s a symbolic reminder that every step toward the temple is a step toward spiritual enlightenment. What makes it even more special is that Moonstones are unique to Sri Lanka — you won’t find them anywhere else in the world. The craftsmanship is incredible, and even after centuries, the carvings are still so detailed and elegant. Tip: Take a moment to stand before it and just observe. Learning about its meaning beforehand makes the experience even more meaningful.","June 25, 2025",0.0,0.0

The moonstones in the monasteries where the forest-dwelling monks lived maintained the blank semi-circular shape. The moonstones of Anuradhapura Era, the outer edge is designed with a ring of flames and below that is a ring filled with 4 types of animals – The elephant, the horse, the lion, and the bull chasing each other. Some moonstones show these beasts in their own semi-circular band. The next is a semi-circle of a creeper with a wavy stem with foliage. Next is a line of swans with a twig of flower and a leaf on their mouth. Next is again a floral pattern and at the center is lotus with petals all around the semi-circle on the moonstone. That the outer ring of fire represents the never-ending life and the pains of passion associated with it. The four animals represent the four noble truths (“Chathurarya Sathya”) which are birth, old age, disease, and death. The leafy creeper next to it is a reminder of desires which creates little fruits but only foliage Next is a motif of swans. It is said that the swan is capable of separating out milk from a mixture of water and milk. He who understands (conquer) four noble truths can easily filter the good from the bad like the swan filters out milk.
