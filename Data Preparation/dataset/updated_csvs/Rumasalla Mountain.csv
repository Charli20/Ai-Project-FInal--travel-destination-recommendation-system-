The famous story of Rumassala related to Ramayana which is a mythical encounter between Rama and Ravana. When Rama’s brother-Lakshman was near-fatally injured in battle, it needed to bring some herbals from the Himalayas. Hanuman the monkey god has undertaken the task, but he forgot the name of the herbs. Hanuman broke a part of one mountain (Holy Sanjeevi) where herbs occurred and rest of the mountain was thrown away after getting the herbs. This fallen part was the origin of Rumassala. The colonial name of Rumassala is Buno Vista implies “pleasant view”. Rumassala hill, forest and sea are declared as a wildlife sanctuary.  Bonavista coral reef is also a part of it. Sir Arthur C. Clarke, who lived at Unawatuna once he moved to Sri Lanka, stated Rumassala is strangely not included within earth’s magnetic field. As a result , he explained that geo-stationary satellites lacking power end up milling round and round, high above this place. It is a heaven for herbs. Researchers have found 150 different species of herbs on Rumassala Hill. These species are unique in that area. In past ships come to Galle harbor used southern end of Rumassala, known as watering point, to stock up with fresh water. The value of Rumassala was high since past due to fresh water even during ancient silk route. The Galle harbor was developed due to Rumassala as ships came to fill fresh water. You can take Bonavista road from Galle-Matara road , just in front of Holcim cement factory to reach Rumassala. The jungle beach, Rumassala south beach and Japanese peace pagoda are main attractions of Rumassala. It is good to visit on a weekday as weekends might be overcrowd the area.","December 4, 2020",0.0,0.0

The Dutch fort lends you a picturesque landscape to the eyes. A great place to watch the sea at play with the contours of the beach running along as far as the eye can see and then you see the Rumasalla Kanda. It is very fascinating indeed. In the sea to land rise evolution, one invariably find the sea with the beach and the land rising slowly up with the vegetation coming along. There is always a definite angle and slope to it. But here at Galle you find the Rumassala Kanda piece of land jutting out like a dolphin nose and one can see that it is out of place in this geography along the coast with its unique rocky topology. This lends great credence to the folklore that it is the piece  that fell of the mountain  which Lord Hanuman was carrying with him while flying over Lanka, bearing the Sanjeevani herb meant to cure Lord Lakshman.

Botanical specialists cannot explain the biodiversity here as it is different to other parts of Sri Lanka. Read the legends before the visit before really doing here. Indians set on fire King Rawana once in a year related to the legend of taking Seeth from India by Rawana with the help of Hanuman. It is not far from Galle. Just at the climb to the hill you will notice that the mountain is located in just flat area without other mountains located in the area. The road is a bit steep as you start climbing the mountain in certain places. There is parking available nearby. The Peace pagoda is found nearby and it itself is nice. You get a beautiful views from here. There is also a Japaneese temple in Rumasala Mountain and it is kind of very special place. You will feel tranquility once you are there. You can enjoy a much pleasing walk from Unawatuna.  Obey the signboards leading to the Jungle Beach or to the Japanese Peace Pagoda also.   It´s worth going by foot. There is a track in the end of Unawatuna beach! The temple has great view and beautiful images of Buddah! It is a lovely place, it has got a tranquil settings around and you have such a amazing view of the Indian ocean.  The temple gives great views in a tranquil setting. The nearby Coco beach is also a good place to chill out. You will find a lovely Hanuman statue also there, just few meters to jungle beach, small and nice beach in a peaceful environment. In the legend, Hanuman brought a piece of Himalaya as he forgot the exact medicine for Sitha’s disease. When taking the needed herbs, the rest were let off and it is how this mountain is created. Truly, the fauna you get there are not native to Sri Lanka. The best time to visit is around 5 - 6 p.m. and also you can enjoy the beautiful sunset as a bonus and also get a terrific view of Galle.","July 9, 2018",0.0,0.0

It’s easy to miss the turn off the main road from the Galle side as it’s not signposted . It’s right above Jungle beach. A tuktuk will take you there but where’s the challenge in that? The last km and a half are on a side road that for the last 500 m is a bit strenuous as it’s uphill with little shade and no breeze. There are beautiful views across the bay to Galle Fort. The temple is small but has a nice Buddha shrine and lead light windows. The stupa has a balcony all round, with three gold Buddha. Please remember it is disrespectful to take a selfie with Buddha. You need to remove shoes and are asked to maintain silence - no phones! There is also a monument to tsunami victims The walk down to Unawatuna beach  is along a road and thru a jungle track. It’s easy to get lost on the jungle track as again no signs and several forks in what is more of a slippery goat track. Locals do send you in directions that are NOT to the beach.

Especially the mountain is said to be carried by Lord Hanuman (Monkey served for King Rama during the battle between King Rama from India and King Ravana from Srilanka) from the Himalayas, with essential herbs which saved the life of Lord Lakshman (Rama’s brother). It has a statue of Hanuman and prayers are offered twice a day by the localities. At the other end of the mountain you can find lovely hidden sandy beach with lot of sea quarrels and colourful fish for snorkelling. Please beware of Sea Urchins which feeding primarily on algae are common in this shallow water are also known as sea hedgehogs, and if you accidentally step on sea urchins, which, if you wonder, is a very unpleasant experience. Removing it is possible if it's not embedded too deeply so don’t forget to take a needle and vinegar in your bag in case, as sea urchin spikes have microscopic ""arrows"" in the opposite direction and if you hit one really good you'll have several spiked embedded and they are not easy to take out just like that, I've seen people who pick at the embedded spikes with needles and it gets really messy. Because much of the iron shore here is full of sea urchin, wearing good water shoes (thick soles) is one of the best ways to prevent this very painful situation. The best remedy is actually (sp?)urich acid (yep, pee pee) and although some think it's ""gross"", soaking the affected part in your own ""medicine"" can bring immediate relief, as the acid will go in through the pores and being to dissolve the spikes. Vinegar also works, but not as fast or as well as nature's remedy, which is conveniently available where ever you are in remote area.  Lastly, all I have to add is that I HIGHLY recommend the thick soled booties or water shoes, and watch your step, they aren't common in sandy areas, but that doesn't mean they are not there, so watch for black balls with quills that are much like those of a porcupine.","March 28, 2017",0.0,0.0

Roomassala or Buona Vista as its known in English is a mountain situated on the southern coast line of Sri Lanka. This mountain is a geographical irregularity on the otherwise flat coastal areas. There are many stories and legends surrounding this mountain that gives it a mysterious image. When your visiting Galle you must find some time to visit this amazing place to experience the uniqueness it offers. I will share with you some legends that surround this mysterious mountain. one legend that is famous is the legend of how it got created as described in the Ramayana, the Indian Hindu Epic by Valmiki. According to Ramayana when Ravan of Lanka abducted Sita the wife of Rama and bought her to Seetha-Eliya in Nuwara-Eliya, Rama with his brother Lakshman and the Monkey God Hanuman invaded Sri Lanka to free her. During that war causalities to Rama’s forces were huge and Rama and Lakshman also got injured. To cure Rama and Lakshman and to restore them to their former status a herb was needed by the physicians. But that herb only grew in the mountains of Himalayas. Hanuman volunteered to go to the Himalayan Mountains and bring the herb. But when he got to the mountain he forgot the name of the herb, so what he did was to grab the whole side of mountain that the herb grew and bring to Sri Lanka. After the physicians got the herb they needed Hanuman threw that part of the mountain away and it feel on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. That piece of Himalayan Mountain is what we know today as Roomassala. I know its a Bizarre story but it makes the journey to Roomassala all the more exciting. It is said that most of the flora and fauna found of roomassala is endemic to this mountain and that those cannot be found any where else around the island. this also is kind of proof that this mountain is not where it belongs. there are also stories about this area having a different magnetic qualities than other places in the world. And that satellites cannot be placed directly above this mountain in space. Even Sir Aurthur C. Clerk has admitted these properties. All these stories and legends whether they are true or false makes a visit to this mountain a memorable experience. - See more at: http://lassanasrilanka.com/roomassala/#sthash.kRkY8SzX.dpuf","September 6, 2014",0.0,0.0

It is not very steep but could be a tiring climb if you go during midday where the sun is so hot. However, I should say that this is the reason that we went to Galle this time. The jungle that is referred to as Rumassala has a lot of trees, herbs, plants and flowers which cannot be seen in other parts of Sri Lanka. Even the sea here is quite different and bright and nice. This particular piece of land juts out of the usual land mass of the country in an awkward manner. It is these special features that attracts the attention of most of the travellers. This place has a temple as well. You can go down to the beach through the jungle and it is one of the most interesting walks that I have ever had in my life. The legend that is about this place is as follows: It is stated that Rama wanted some medicine from the Himalayas in India and named the specific herb he needs and asked Hanuma - the monkey king to bring it for him. However, when he went there he had forgotten and because of that he had picked a piece of the mountain and brought it to Rama. After the relevant plant was used Hanuma has thrown the piece of the mountain according to the legend. Whether one believes the legend or not, there is an interesting thing to be noted. The plant varieties in Rumassala cannot be found anywhere else in Sri Lanka. But there are similar to the ones that can be found in Himalayas according to the naturalists and the environmentalists. Hence, I would suggest that you read about this place before going there so that you can enjoy its mysteries. P.s: We got down to the beach from one route and lost our way (we did not know that we lost our way) and then came up to the road from another route. It was very interesting though :)","February 28, 2013",0.0,0.0
