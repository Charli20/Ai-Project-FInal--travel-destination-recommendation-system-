It makes you re-think the uniqueness of the Romans, although most of Ritigala is 8th century, so a little later than the best of the Roman empire in Europe. Their skill in building and the beautiful little details - the feet carved in the stone marking where to stand on the urinal, for instance - reveal a deep and rich Buddhist culture which was fed by the beauty and rhythms of nature all around.

That’s why they close the entrance at 4pm. Final 3km is on a gravel road but easily drivable by any type of vehicle. Ancient ruins and pathways will give you a feeling of a relic hunter.

Sort of off beaten track (it’s getting more popular nowadays). Inside Ritigala, there was very few people. Thoroughly enjoyed clam atomosoher in this beautiful ruins. There is a guide at the entrance, which was 10USD. I didn’t take it at the beginning and walked into the forest. However, there is no explanation apart from names only in Sinhala. After 10 mins, I saw another group having a guide, who I overheard explained things very well. So, I decided to go all way back to the entrance to get a guide. The verdict was mixed feelings. Apparently, only one guide there can speak English well enough to explain things and to have a conversation (answering questions), who was the one I saw. The one I got was just like a broken tape recorder. Only mentioning names of places, like ‘kitchen’, ‘toilet’. He even passed a spot where I saw another guide was giving some explanation to his group. I made him stop and insisted to get some explanations even though most of the time, he just kept saying ‘ok, ok’.  In the end, it became sort of ok, but definitely not worth 10USD. He seemed to sense that I wasn’t really happy, then took me to some areas where a sign said ‘do not entre’. He showed me some ruins inside the forest off the main route. This part was very good. On the top of the route, I met the other ‘good’ guide again. He even asked me what I thought about my guide. When I said no good, he gave me a empathetic nod. (Basically he knows) When I paid, I didn’t have small rupees equivalent to10USD. So I had to round up and ended up paying him even tips, which he wouldn’t definitely be deserved.

This was my third visit to this fascinating mystical ruins.  These Ruins, open to the public, is within the ‘Strict Natural Reserve’ that encompasses the larger Ritigala Mountain.  We purchased our tickets at the entrance.  The cost of a ticket is Rs 20 for locals (including residents) and Rs 500 for foreigners. The tour began with our tour leader visiting the Department of Archaeology site office to seek the services of a guide from the Department.  Starting from the Department offices we walked the first 100 metres of difficult terrain climbing up to “Banda Pokuna” (Built Pond).  The guide sat us down here and gave an introduction to the ruins and indicated on a map of the places we were to visit.  The ruins had been a monastery of a sect of Buddhist monks practicing extreme austerity wearing only robes made out of rags. Theirs was a life of meditation, seeking the ultimate truth, coming down from their caves only to accept food brought by visitors.  There had been a great deal of support for these monks from the ancient kings who built up this monastery for their use. This reservoir had been built in the 4th century bc and has a circumference of around 370 metres.  The inner surface is made up of steps using cleanly cut uniform stones (of about neatly cut 1000 x 30 x 15mm).  The top of the bund too is paved with similarly cut stones.  It is thought that the reservoir had been used by devotees who visited the temple. To get to the ruins we walked along the bund and across the stream that flows into this man made reservoir.  The walk across the stream is somewhat difficult as there are no built up steps.  However after we crossed the river and walked uphill we came to a neatly laid path, about 1.5 metre wide,  constructed using cleanly cut interlocking four sided rectangular stone slabs lined with kerbs on either side demonstrating excellent craftsmanship.  Even though our visit was around noon (between 1000 and 1300 hrs), the light along the path was soft and diffused from the overhanging branches of large trees.  The air itself was quite cool and comfortable.  The meandering stone paved path leads you to the many ruins scattered over an area of about 120 acres. Three circular platforms (roundabouts) called ‘Gimanhala’ built at locations along the way had been to provide rest to devotees while walking along the hilly pathway.  The guide took us off the main path to the ruins of a hospital (Janthagara) for monks with a sunken bath complete with grinding stones for preparing herbal medicines and a hearth that had been used to boil water and preparation of herbal concoctions.  We saw the ruins of a number of twin buildings with raised platforms enclosed within a courtyard, built atop a large boulder or rock foundation, joined with a stone bridge (Padhanagara).  One of these twin buildings is larger than the other and believed to have had a roof while the other was open.  There are also walking paths for meditation as well as the ruins of a library.  Bridges with stone slabs provide for crossing water streams.  Photos are attached with limited explanation.  Photos nor a description such as this can never do justice to what you see, feel and experience at the location. The guide showed us some stone slabs that had been drilled at a spacing of about 15 cm apart.  He explained that this had been the method used to split the rock.  The holes had been filled with a chemical or stuffed with material that would expand within the holes to split the rock.  The stones then were smoothed out using chisels or similar tools. Unlike at other Buddhist places of worship, there are no Buddha statues nor any decorations in any of the buildings demonstrating the beliefs and austerity of the monks who inhabited this monastery.  The only item with decorations was a urinal, perhaps demonstrating the aversion to decoration. The guide recounted a number of interesting legends related to these mountains.  This description is already too elaborate for me to recite these legends.  The visitor is encouraged to read about these at various internet forums as these depict the history and beliefs of the local people. It is a somewhat tiring walk.  Wear a pair of shoes with a good grip.  If you feel you are not up to go through the whole distance of about 3 km, you can stop in the shady undergrowth and sit on one of many stone structures.  Even if you see part of the forest and the ruins it is well worth your while!","December 25, 2017",0.0,0.0

It's difficult to get to heaven in the heat but well worth it. Leaves you wondering how they did it all those years ago. Very quiet and not touristy.

Ritigala is a strict forest reserve and is known for its mountain range known as ""Ritigala Kanda"". Ritigala Kanda is the highest mountain in the Northern Region of Sri Lanka accounting for 766 m (2,513 feet) above sea level. Even though the reserve and the mountain is situated in the dry zone of Sri Lanka, the weather conditions at the peak of the mountain, and the vegetation of the mountain is completely different what you would see with the other peaks of the area. If one is interested in visiting the reserve then permission needs to be obtained from the Department of Wild Life in Sri Lanka. The legends say that the plants found in the peak of Ritigala Mountain range differ due to the fact that it is a part of mountain carried by Hanuman from Himayala during the battle of Ravana and Rama had dropped whilst flying over  the Ritigala range. In addition this legend the mountain range is well known for its Forest Monastery that dates back to 437 - 367 BC located in the Eastern side of the mountain range. Today the Monastery is in ruins, it is said that the monks who lived within the monastery did not mingle much with humans, and spent time building their spiritual life, with spending most of the time in meditation. Unlike most of the temples and monastery's in Sri Lanka, the monastery in Ritigala does not have any decorations or anything that depict beauty or happiness. The only point where something of beauty was seen was on the ground piece of a urinal,  and this is also to depict that the monks have let of all materialist things in life, by trampling them. The climb to the end of the monastery would take approximately 1 hours just to clime. But for someone who likes to snoop around well you have to be ready with plenty of time and water to drink. In addition to these Ritigala was known for the traditional martial arts form known as ""Angam Poroa"" which originated from the region, and legend says the the ""Yodha"" (Gian Worriors) a set of people how had super strength beyond a normal human being who served the kings who ruled the country spent time practicing the form of martial arts. It is further said, the one of the Yodha named ""Ritigala Jayasena"" who served King Dutugamunu, offended another giant warrior named Gotaimbara in a state of drunkenness. Finally they agree to a bare-hand dual. It is said that during the dual Gotaimbara decapitated Jayaseana with a single kick. Seeing the predicament deity offers to revive Jayasena before the corps go cold, and in the haste as they were unable to find the head of cuts off the head of bear, and fixes it to the body. Since there was much chaos, the head was fixed backwards. Even though Jayasena did get reviewed, people became horrified with the form now he was in and became ill every time someone came across Jayasena, and later he was known as ""Mahasona"".

Although some say the name “Ritigala” is derived from the ancient name “Arittha Pabbata” or “dreadful mountain” as mentioned in the Mahavamsa, the guide from the archaeological society who took us on a guided tour said that the name was given after a group of Enlightened Buddhist monks too residence there.  The Ritigala sanctuary is a very peaceful & lovely place to visit for those who wish to experience a bit of serene architectural splendour.  The trek up to the meditation grounds/hospital grounds of the ancient Buddhist Sinhalese era takes about 1 hour & a half. You’d meet an enormous bathing pond which is now empty but back in the day it used to have held about 20,000 Gallons of water in it or more. The pathways are rugged but the trees growing beside it offer the welcome shade to the weary traveller and there are many places where you can stop to rest & perhaps meditate if you wish. In the meditation grounds, there are many places where monks had done walking meditation & other forms of meditative practices. An absolute gem of a place to visit for history lovers & just a very meagre entrance fee for locals & foreign tourists.","November 4, 2016",0.0,0.0

Much of the ruins are simply the foundations, columns, and pathways that led around this once massive monastery, but for those people who have an imagination, love nature, and want to get off the beaten path this place is perfect.

It is generally open from 7:30-18h with no fee, but they can ask for donations at times.

The most amazing thing about Ritigala is how they have used rock to build this whole monastery where around 2000 enlightened beings used to live. The ruins you see is the whole complex which includes a complete path to access the monastery, stone bridges, ancient toilets, ponds, meditating area's, a library, walking meditation area's and a hospital. It's dates back to 1st century BC (some argue 5000 years ago during the Ravana kingdom). Another weird thing about this place is how this lush green area exists in the middle of a flat dry land (North Central Sri Lanka is very dry and no mountains). Also the climate at the summit is in sharp contrast to the climate at the foot; it is cooler in comparison to hot and dry climate of the region. The legend states Lord Hanuman of supernatural powers, traveled over Ritigala, and, by accident, dropped a chunk off a mountain of the Himalaya range he was carrying from India to Sri Lanka for its medicinal herbs. Lord Rama's brother, Prince Lakshmana was mortally wounded in battle and only a rare herb in the Himalaya could save his life. The pocket of vegetation of healing herbs and plants at the strange mini-plateau at the summit of Ritigala, which is distinct from the dry-zone flora of the lower slopes and surrounding plains at Ritigala, could thus be accounted for. It also states 'Yakkas' who apparently built this with their superhuman powers and they used special herbs to dissolve the stone in to liquid to build structures. Still archaeologists can't figure out how they managed to make such structures using only stone considering the limited technology they had. Whatever is true or not, this place is a must visit place if you are around Anuradhapura, Sigiriya. Very easy to travel and you will need about max 3-4 hours to cover the whole place. Go with an open mind and do your research. You will love it.","February 4, 2016",0.0,0.0

If you sit there for some time you will see rare birds which come there to drink water. When you will get to the top of the path after seeing a few ruins you will see the sign of a restricted reserve area. Big rare langurs live there. They are called ""bear monkeys"".

We took a bus bound for Anuradhapura and got off at the Ritigala Junction.  From there we took a tuk-tuk.  This felt like a rip-off as the driver ended up charging us 1300 rs.  I could tell we were paying a good rate as he was smiling for the whole trip.  Anyhow once you start up the trail to the ruins you will forget about any tuk-tuk negotiations.  At the site we were told there was an entrance fee of (I want to say) 1300 rs. each, which we balked at.  We were then asked to make a donation of 500 rs. each which seemed more reasonable. There was no one else on the trails and we had plenty of time to explore the various ruins.  There were small offshoots at some of the trails where there were some significant additional ruins.  Make sure you've got an hour or two to explore everything.  Highly recommended if you are down with photography.","November 3, 2014",0.0,0.0

All we saw was the guy at the entrance, 4 dogs and another couple. There’s a main track that you can follow up and down and see a few site, but the fun begins when you look around, in the forest, and try to look for ruins. Look in the jungle for the faint tracks leading to sites or the “big stone sticks”, hinting that something cool is around. On our way down we realize there was so much to discover outside the beaten track. Everytime I went deeper in the forest I found another cool thing, remains of a praying site, mysterious grottos, name it. Sites aren’t as impressive as the other touristic ruins, but the fact that you’re discovering them yourselves and that you’re all alone really adds to the experience.

It's not. As we had already used half a day in a Sigiriya visit, my partner and I decided to take a trip to nearby Ritigala during our final day in the Habarana area.  Our driver took us as far as he dared and we then clambered aboard the the tuk tuk that had followed us from Habarana (on reflection, we should have just got the tuk tuk from there).   After a short ride along a bumpy dirt track, we arrived at a few scruffy buildings and were ushered inside one to sign the visitor book and also pay the 'donation' fee of 500Rs each.   can't complain about the 500Rs as that is pretty much pocket change to most westerners.  From there we were offered a tour guide to which we declined as we preferred just to explore ourselves. The ruins are not impressive at all - they don't seem particularly ancient.  If you've been anywhere there are some impressive ruins  - e.g. Pompeii, Athens or Latin America, you might even walk past the Ritigala ruins assuming that the real ruins are further on.  Well, they aren't.   When you reach a point where there's a square with some old building foundations, the rest of the path is blocked off - apparently it's because of the risk from dangerous wildlife (snakes, scorpions etc)..   I'd actually have been quite interested in seeing some of those but safety first, I suppose. On the positive side, it's a reasonably pleasant walk in the forest with all the Sri Lanka forest noises that you'd expect - we didn't see much in the way of wildlife -  a few interesting bright red bugs and a couple of monkeys in the trees but it's more of a walk in the park than a walk on the wild side. Truthfully, I'd skip Ritigala unless you have a lot of time to kill and have run out of other things to do. + Fairly secluded/not very busy + free/donation + pleasant forest walk - ruins distinctly unimpressive - top is blocked off","May 5, 2014",0.0,0.0

Near the vehicle park there is a office where one has to give the details of the travelling people. The climb is about 500m. Not very difficult fully worth the effort. Take some water or soft drink but do not litter.At the Ayurveda hospital site I noticed a ""Grease Trap"" you find in modern hotel installations to separate oil from water before sending out. This was at the drain path of the ""Oil Bath"" of the hospital. Certainly the WOW factor is there.","October 14, 2013",0.0,0.0

There were only four other tourists there and the hour or so walk through the jungle to view the ruins was exceptional.

There are miles of ancient stone paths and steps though the forest, some of which have been restored. There are ruined refectories and enigmatic 'roundabouts' (apparently for walking meditation). The trees and wildlife are beautiful and there is the sound of waterfalls all around you. It's quite cool, but like many sites in Sri Lanka involves many hundred rock steps and a bit of a scramble at times. The atmosphere is out of this world. It is not visited all that much, which adds to its charm. It's on a rough track from the main road (our driver booked a jeep). When we got to the ticket office, still several kilometres from the entrance, a huge tree had fallen across the road and nothing had been done about it (it falls between the Forestry Department and another), so we paid a local lad to take us down the track on his motorbike! Clouds of butterflies rose up as we went along the track and I heard load roaring and crashing noises from the forest (wild elephants). There was birdsong everywhere.","January 18, 2013",0.0,0.0

It was very much a success. The park is an old monastery with surprisingly well conserved ruins. Tourists have obviously not truly spotted this place (yet!) and the artefacts are not covered in glas etc. but appears to be as they were left by the monks a few thousand years ago. At the entrance about 2 km from the actual park there is a visitor centre which is quickly overseen. We did not see any official staff but were met by 3-4 men with a jeep who adviced us that an ordinary car could not make it the last 2km to the park as the road was damaged. Instead they proposed to take us by jeep and give us a tour for 4000 rupees. We took it for a scam (of which there are many in Sri Lanka) but when we decided to walk the last bit one of them insisted on following us at least to park. To make a long story short the truth was that the road WAS impassable by ordinary car and the elephant danger was in fact very real. The elephant stories were later validated by pictures and other locals. As elephants are present all year nobody should try to walk, but in dry seasons (we visited in January) any car can do the trip. We ended up asking the ""guide"" to follow with us the entire trip which was a good decision as - his poor English aside - was very knowlegable about the site and show us stuff we would never have found by ourselves. The trip includes a approx 4km hike up a mountain side (medium intensity) and lasts about 2-3hours. There is an entrance fee of 1500 rupees pr person (be aware that the staff might try to persuade you to a lower price which they will then keep to them selves - if possible pay full and ask for a receipt). After the trip the guide was so nice as to invite us for lunch with his family. Best experience so far! He lives in a small house on the corner right in front of the visitor centre. If you pass by and want a guide be sure to ask him.","January 16, 2013",0.0,0.0

The site itself is like nothing else I've found in Sri Lanka. No statues, stupas, living quarters, or any of the other things you find in religious sites elsewhere. On arrival, someone will take your money, or Cultural Triangle ticket, and warn you about bears in the forest. Then you are directed up a dirt / mud track which brings you to one end of the tank that served as a water source. From there you need to pick your way along a narrow path through the trees for about 100 yards before reaching a set of steps. This is not a disabled-friendly place. The monastary itself consists of a series of clearings connected by granite tracks. The clearings contain ruins but no one really seems to know what most of them were for.
