There’s a bit of a climb, but the views at the stops are beautiful and you may even spot monkeys along the way. The temple itself is a short visit, but very interesting — built into the rock with impressive statues. We hired a guide who did explain some details about the statues, but there was a language barrier (limited English) and it felt like a memorized tourist script, so it was only partly informative. I’d still recommend the visit, but next time I’d skip the guide and do a quick read beforehand (even ChatGPT) for the same value.","December 16, 2025",0.0,0.0

This isn't just a temple; it is an art gallery carved into rock. The complex consists of five main caves, each filled with stunning Buddha statues and ceiling paintings that date back centuries. The colors and details, preserved inside the cool caves, are incredible to see in person. Tips for Future Visitors: Buy Tickets at the Bottom: This is the #1 mistake travelers make! The ticket counter is at the bottom of the hill (near the Golden Temple statue). If you climb the stairs without a ticket, you will have to go all the way back down. The Climb: It is roughly 360 steps (about 15-20 minutes). It is not extremely difficult, but it can be hot. Take your time and enjoy the view of Sigiriya Rock in the distance from the top terrace. Dress Code: You must cover shoulders and knees. I always recommend my guests bring a sarong or scarf to wrap around before entering the courtyard. Watch the Monkeys: The path is full of toque macaque monkeys. They are fun to watch, but do not feed them or carry plastic bags with food, as they can be cheeky. Whether you are interested in history, art or Buddhism, Dambulla is unmissable. I recommend visiting in the late afternoon (around 4:00 PM) when the light is golden and the heat has gone down. A truly spiritual experience.","December 12, 2025",0.0,0.0

THE SECRET SHORTCUT TO THE TOP by Travel Lunatics,5,Family,"PRO TIP: SAVE YOUR LEGS! THE SECRET SHORTCUT TO THE TOP Avoid the main, long, steep staircase entirely! Most visitors waste huge amounts of energy on the primary path, but there's a detour that cuts off almost 70% of the climbing effort. After buying your ticket near the Archaeological Museum, ask a local or tuk-tuk driver to point you toward the ""easier road"" or the ""security hut"" near the giant seated Golden Buddha statue. There is a cement-inclined road that dramatically cuts the ascent. Use this path to get straight to the upper complex entrance. Dambulla is more than a destination; it’s a portal into history. While the large Golden Temple complex at the base is impressive, the real magic—and the part that deserves the attention—is up the ancient rock. The effort to reach the top is profound, and what truly took my breath away was the atmosphere and the art inside the five main caves: Devaraja Viharaya, Maharaja Viharaya, Maha Alut Viharaya, Paschima Viharaya, and Devana Alut Viharaya. The Standout Experience: You climb the rock in Sri Lanka's intense heat, and when you finally remove your shoes and step under the cave overhang, the temperature drops instantly. You transition from the harsh sun to a dim, cool, incense-scented silence. Inside the five main caves, the sense of scale is overwhelming. The ceilings aren't flat, plastered canvases—they are the natural, curved rock face, painted over with an astonishing, unbroken fresco covering over 2,100 square meters. It feels less like a series of caves and more like being inside the mind of the Buddha itself, where every surface, curve, and crack tells a story. What Makes It Unique (Look for These Insider Details!): • Cave 2 (Maharaja Viharaya): This is the largest cave and holds the most secrets: • The First Flag & Great Battle: Look for the mural depicting the great battle between King Elara and King Dutugamunu. Look very closely for the flag King Dutugamunu is carrying—it is believed to be one of the earliest representations of the Sri Lankan flag! Its location is roughly parallel to the water pot. • The Gunman Proof: In the spectacular Maraparajaya mural (Temptation of Mara), look for the highly unusual detail of a man holding a gun in the far right corner. This detail is key proof that the murals belong to the 17th-19th century Kandyan era, as guns were introduced then. This mural is one of only two known to exist in the entire country with this detail! • Royal Statues: Near the second entrance, find the statue of King Valagamba (the temple’s founder), and note the restricted corner where the statue of King Nissankamalla (the 12th-century restorer) is situated. • Rare Buddha Posture: Look for the standing Buddha painted orange with crossed hands—a rare position depicting universal kindness. • Cave 4 (Paschima Viharaya): Look for the small stupa here, named Somawathi Stupa, which scholars believe once contained the jewelry of King Valagamba’s Queen Somawathi. Notice the line of separation on the plaster: the lower part is the original, and the upper part was replaced after the stupa was sadly robbed in centuries past. • Cave 5 (Devana Alut Viharaya): At the very far right end of the back wall, search for the unique black mural of the god Vishwakaruna Divya puthra, who is responsible for arts and music. Quick Tip for Visitors: • Timing: Go as early as possible (opens at 7 AM) to beat the heat and the tour bus crowds. • The View: Don't rush past the top terrace! On a clear day, the panoramic view gives you a perfect perspective of the flat plains stretching out, with the famous Sigiriya Rock Fortress visible in the distance—it's a great payoff after the climb.","November 7, 2025",0.0,0.0

From having flowers shoved in your face and demanding money, to having to pay to place your shoes on a rack, completely unnecessary.

Unfortunately, there is no additional information about the place (like labels), and you need to have a guide to understand the context. We had to hire local guide (as we were told we can’t enter with our own) and this was not a nice experience. He rushed us through the caves in 10 minutes, talking incredibly fast, just wishing to finish as soon as possible. While we were walking in the caves after “our tour” we saw some decent guides showing and explaining all kind of symbols to other lucky visitors. Therefore we still don’t know if we were so unlucky with the local guide or we could bring some guide with proper license from outside. If you look down the hill there are lots of plastic bottles and trash. Considering the ticket price, it could be cleaned.

I really like visiting this temple. This is UNESCO world heritage site number 561. There is a bit of a steep hill to climb to get to the entrance, so if you are handicapped, you may not be able to do it. I just wanted to mention this because we had a person who walks with a cane and she could not do it. There is an entrance fee of Rs 2,000 for each foreigner (non Sri Lankan citizen) to enter, they will give you a ticket after you pay (see picture). My wife is a Sri Lankan citizen and there was no fee for her. I’m actually Sri Lankan, but if you look like you don’t live here, they will ask for proof that you live here. Don’t cause problems, just pay the Rs 2,000 or approximately USD $6, it’s worth it. Like all Buddhist temples in Sri Lanka, you must remove your shoes before entering. This place can get crowded, so if you do not want to wait in line to leave your shoes with the people who will watch them for you or if you have some expensive shoes and you are worried about leaving them, then carry a simple shopping bag with you and place your shoes inside the bag before entering, you can carry the bag inside with no problems. Also, you cannot wear shorts and a tank top, you must have covered shoulders and your knees covered. If you attempt to go inside without these areas covered they will give you something that you must wear to cover up. These are handed from person to person, so if you are concerned about germs, then wear appropriate clothing before you go. The day we visited it started raining when we were about to leave and we got soaking wet because there is a bit of a walk down the hill to the car. I recommend you take an umbrella with you if it looks like it may rain. I have no complaints about this place and look forward to visiting again.","January 4, 2024",0.0,0.0

We did it the same day as Sigiriya Rock so after a 1200 step climb in Sigiriya, it was a 600 step climb up Dambulla. If you are in the area longer then doing it on two different days, would be better. If not, do it on the same day and do not miss seeing the caves. There are five main caves that you can see. You can take photographs inside the caves too but do not use flash photography inside to preserve the frescos and the serene atmosphere inside the caves. My tour guide seemed to indicate that there were no rules against flash photography (he may be mistaken) but I did not use any flash photography inside. The frescos are painted on the walls and the ceilings and are absolutely awesome to see in the dim light in the caves. Give yourself about 2 hours to see the place. There are places while climbing the steps where you can pause, take some pics and give your legs a little rest before proceeding up. There is a place to leave your footwear, a little away from the caves. There is also a small entrance fee to enter the caves. Also they do close the caves for 15-20 minutes in the morning - I think at 10 am for worship of the Buddha statues inside the caves. So be aware of that. We saw 2 caves and then had to wait outside till they reopened to see the other 3 caves. Sigiriya Rock and Dambulla Caves both are absolutely awesome and must not be missed if you are visiting the area.","July 29, 2023",0.0,0.0

Once you are up there the views are epic, if you go late afternoon (around 4.30pm for me) there are not too many people around so easier to see the caves properly.

Take a note of the ornately painted cave ceilings too. Depending on when you visit, the monks do occasionally shut the caves for prayer, but no problem it's only for about 15 minutes. Tip - if you're driving or being driven, enter by the rear steps on the access road a little further into town, as this way you pass the ticket office.

Dambulla is the largest and best-preserved cave temple complex in Sri Lanka. The rock towers 160 m over the surrounding plains. There are more than 80 documented caves in the surrounding area. Major attractions are spread over five caves, which contain statues and paintings. These paintings and statues are related to Gautama Buddha and his life. There are a total of 153 Buddha statues, three statues of Sri Lankan kings and four statues of gods and goddesses. The latter include Vishnu and the Ganesha. The murals cover an area of 2,100 square metres (23,000 sq ft). Depictions on the walls of the caves include the temptation by the demon Mara, and Buddha's first sermon. The Dambulla cave monastery is still functional and remains the best-preserved ancient edifice in Sri Lanka.

Dambulla rock is an ideal place to look around. Better visit in early morning or late evening. And better avoid in public holidays and weekends as it gets crowded.

There are more than 80 caves in the area with the 5 caves most worth viewing. The first king turned the caves into a temple complex and many kings added to it later until the 11th century. It is still a functioning temple complex till this day. The spectacular murals on the ceilings were of sheer magnificence. They depicted Buddha’s life and sermons. The guide pointed out the large statue of the reclining Buddha on his deathbed judging by the way the feet was displayed. Stupas, a hundred small Buddha statues, some gods and goddesses and kings statues were on display. One of the five caves was under repair, and we managed to take a quick look of it. The second cave was the largest and most impressive. They say you must never turn your back to the Buddha when taking a photo. I felt intense spiritual power in these ancient caves and decided against taking any pictures out of respect. There was a small basin with water dripping down from the ceiling that the guide said would never dry up and have healing powers. Once out of the temple caves we realised how the temple was cut out of a massive overhanging rock. We went under a huge Bodhi tree and made a wish. It was just too bad we could not find time to see the ancient Bodhi tree at Anuradhapura. A very moving spiritual experience indeed.","October 6, 2019",0.0,0.0

This temple was built in the 1st century BC, by King Valagamba. Mahawansa (old book) says about invasion of seven Tamils from South India in Vlagamba’s reign, (103 BC). The king was unable to fight against them so he fled. Driven out of Anuradhapura by Tamil and remained in exile for 14 years. He came to Dambulla and took refuge in the cave for 14 years. In the meantime he collected an army and went back to Anuradhapura and regained the throne and his second reign was (89-77BC). After regaining the power the king wanted to show his gratitude to the temple. He converted this cave into an interior carved beautiful Buddhist temple. Before the valagamba’s arrival, this cave was donated to the Buddhist monks as dwelling place by king Saddhatissa (137-119 BC).Under the drip ledge of the main cave there is a Brahmi letter inscription. Many other King added to it later and by the 11th century, the caves had become a major religious place. King Nissankamalla gilded the caves and added about 70 Buddha statues in 1190 AD. During the 18th century, belong to kandyan period. This complex of the cave at Dambilla is one of the most impressive Buddhist temples in the world with its great number of Buddha statues and more than 20,000 feet paintings.Todat Dambulla is a world heritage site declared by UNESCO in 1991. thank you, Prasad.","August 14, 2019",0.0,0.0

The trick is to make sure you buy your ticket to enter the caves at the bottom of the steps, as it is not obvious this is the process. To enter most Buddhist Temples you need to dress modestly, no exposed shoulders and knees covered - they do rent items to cover you at the temple entrance. You also need to pay to have your shoes minded whilst you are in the temple and the person you pay is very reluctant to give change so make sure you have the exact amount of 25 rupees. The cost to enter the cave is 1500 rupees. There are five caves and they are stocked with many Buddhas in all manner of positions - if you are yet to visit Myanmar, Thailand, or other such Buddhist countries you will be amazed, but to be honest the South East Asian countries have many of these caves and do it all a lot better.

From here you will have to first climb a bit, then get down, take the tickets and climb back again. Easiest option is go from the back side, pick the tickets from the booking office and get down at the next gate. From there the climb is lesser. Also there arent steps to climb from here. So slightly easier. You may be able to spot ""Giant squirrel"" if you are lucky. There are loads of monkeys near the cave and they snatch food. So be careful. The caves are good and maintained well. I met lot of crowd there.It can be done if you have time. But would recommend to visit in the morning hours.","March 1, 2019",0.0,0.0

One has steps the other a steep slope. We didn’t fancy the steps so went the other way, which I believe takes a bit longer. It was a bit of a trek, but fine, definitely worth it to see the cave temple. It’s amazing how tranquil they are considering the crowds. There are 5 caves in all. The first one is tiny so some patience (and queuing) is needed. The second one is huge and the third is pretty big too. When you’ve seen those three you’ve seen the best of it and the other caves are just more of the same. Remember to cover your shoulders and knees. Take a pair of socks because you can’t wear shoes inside. They will look after your shoes outside the entrance for 50Sr a pair. Otherwise take a bag and carry them around. Also, most importantly don’t pose for pictures with your back to Budda, it’s a big no no. The path to the left on the way down leads you to the Golden Temple Of Dambulla, with its giant Budda, which is worth seeing just by itself.

Sure, the setting is a novelty with the temples set inside five decorated caves and there are an incredible number of Buddha statues but, fundamentally, there is little to set the place apart. We had anticipated a series of caverns but the caves are actually 5 individual units. Inside each the lighting is subdued and, as a result, the whole atmosphere is gloomy and uninspiring. We have visited many, many temples in the likes of Thailand, Myanmar and Cambodia, generally without charge, and seen some stunning interiors. Sadly this place didn’t live up to those standards. On a practical level, the ticket office is located a considerable distance from the road which makes for a significant walk (for those arriving independently) before you even begin the climb up the hill. Enter at the Golden Temple, follow the sign for the Cave Temple and just keep going until, eventually, you get to the ticket office.

If you have not been to many other places that are similar it is definitely a must visit. Otherwise, I'd recommend it if you have time and interest in this type of attraction but I would not rearrange my schedule to fit it in. The caves themselves are not very large and are quite warm inside. The walls and ceilings are painted and beautiful to look at - more so then the Buddhas in my opinion. The lighting is ROUGH for photography unless you have specialized equipment. The caves are dark with spotlights in various areas. This makes the location less of an Instagram-worthy location if that's your thing but most people should enjoy the sights just fine. I'd recommend going first thing in the morning to avoid crowds and to avoid the heat. The caves were already hot at 8 am so I can't imagine what it gets like later in the day. Also be prepared to climb stairs to get there. About 365 of them. Its steep and while I thought it was worth the cardio workout - someone who is out of shape or who has impaired mobility may not be able to make it. Tips: - don't forget to wear long pants and tops with shoulders covered. Men included. or bring a sarong to wrap around if you have shorts on. - This is a Buddhist temple so you need to leave your shoes near the entrance (there is a safe location to do so) and walk around barefoot. You will be walking on stone/concrete. - With the climb up and plenty of time spent in each cave we did the whole thing in 1.5 hours. - There is plenty of parking and clean bathrooms at the bottom of the stairs for public use.","January 16, 2019",0.0,0.0

If that's your thing too, this could be an interesting stop. The cave paintings, especially on the ceilings, are fascinating to observe, especially where imperfections in the roof of the caves warp the murals into dreamlike waves of iconography. That said, it's not a big place, and the caves are warm and stale enough that you won't exactly set up shop for a meditative experience. Some of the charm is also watered down by the fact that it is set up with fairly harsh lighting that nonetheless doesn't help a photographer trying to capture a good image of the place. So if you want a feast for the eyes that will have to stay with your eyes only, it's not the worst way to spend a morning. The stairs are no joke, though.

Very interesting place and worth a visit (and worth climbing all the steps). A few pointers: It’s worth having a guide with you. We were on a private tour of the country with a driver/guide and he was able to explain the history of the caves and the significance of the paintings in each one. It would have been quite difficult to have the same appreciation if you just went up and looked around by yourself. It’s a fully functioning religious site, of huge significance to the Sri Lankan people. There are periods of worship throughout the day when visitors need to wait outside. Both ladies and gentlemen need to wear clothes which cover the elbows and their knees. Transgressors were turned away without exception (and left at the mercy of the very enterprising sarong salesman on the steps outside!) Our guide intervened when a Japanese tourist was about to commit the massively disrespectful offence of photographing his companion with her back to an image of Buddha.

I am fairly fit, and it took me and our group about 40 minutes to get to the caves, with a few rest bite stops. Please remember to wear clothes which are longer than knee length as you will not be able to enter. They only seem to charge foreigners (approximately £7), to enter the main cave complex, which I don't think is fair,  as either everyone should pay something, or it should be free for all. Either way, the caves are impressive, with several ancient paintings and statues, created over several centuries by devotees to Lord Buddha.

As with all Buddhist temples, you have to check your shoes and take off your hat. The interior of the caves are filled with many different version of Buddha statues. The walls have ancient paintings. One of my favorite Buddha statues was in the first cave that you reach. Behind it, peaking out to greet you was a smaller statue of the last king of the second kingdom.

The caves are at a slight altitude so I would recommend wearing something comfortable for a 20-30 minute hike up some steep steps. Also there were many monkeys near the steps so I would recommend not taking anything edible like fruits etc openly since it could attract the monkeys. Also remember that there is an entrance fee of ~1500 LKR so don't forget to buy these tickets before climbing the steps Once you climb the steps and reach the top, the view is absolutely beautiful! There is a place to store your footwear near the cave complex just besides the entrance. The caves themselves are very beautiful and I would recommend that you take your best night/low light photography equipment you have. The paintings on the top of the caves are very colorful and detailed and you would definitely want to take a few shots of these pictures. The statues of the Buddha's in various poses are a real sight to see. The cave complex itself is very well maintained and shouldn't take you more than 50-60 minutes to complete. TIP: if you plan to visit the Temple complex during the evening I would highly recommend a torch light and some mosquito repellent. It can get very dark once the sun sets and there were many mosquitos on the way down mainly because of the surrounding forests. This place is definitely worth a visit with family and friends.","December 18, 2018",0.0,0.0
