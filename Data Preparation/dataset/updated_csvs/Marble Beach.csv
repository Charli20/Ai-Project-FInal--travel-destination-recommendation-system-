The scenery is breathtaking – a small bay with crystal-clear turquoise waters and smooth white pebbles that give the beach its “marble” name. Surrounded by mountains filled with pine trees and olive groves, it feels like a hidden gem in nature. The facilities are excellent: there is plenty of parking space, including spots for disabled visitors, and the sunbeds with their woven umbrellas are very comfortable. The atmosphere is relaxing with great music in the background and delicious cocktails to enjoy by the sea. A special mention goes to Chrysa, the wonderful and welcoming owner, who makes every guest feel at home and is always ready to help. Her hospitality adds so much warmth to the whole experience. If you’re visiting Thassos, Marble Beach is an absolute must – a perfect mix of natural beauty, comfort, and great vibes","August 18, 2025",0.0,0.0

It's nothing like it is in the photos. First off they didn't even bother making a road and it's a muddy, sand road all the way till the parking area. My car got extremely dirty and muddy driving through it. Secondly, the most important part of Marble Beach, the Marble Beach. It's always densely occupied and it's impossible to swim in, not because the sea is rough but because of the sheer amount of people there. Thirdly, the water is so disgusting and muddy and it's not suitable for swimming. Fourthly, even after paying for the tickets you can't even cross into majority of the beach as it's for ""Authorized Personnel Only"". How can they divide up a public property that belongs to the citizens like it belongs to them? It's extremely unethical and just overall a waste of time and money. I came all the way from Colombo travelling almost 250km just to find a beach where I can't even swim in. As a local I find this unacceptable and extremely disappointing and I very highly suggest you do not ever visit this beach at all whether you're a local citizen or a tourist.","December 28, 2024",0.0,0.0

Crystal clear and calm sea, the most transparent we have seen near Trincomalee. Recommendation to go to Air Force Resort. You pay 500 rupees each, and you have a part of the beach where there are 5/6 big straw umbrellas. The beach as well as the sea are delimited by reviews and you can not go further. There's only one kiosk where you can drink. To eat instead you have to bring lunch because there is only one restaurant but it is by Reservation. It is advisable to go there in the morning not too late because at least it is quieter and you can take a seat since the area is limited. I do not recommend going to the public beach because it is super crowded with local people.","July 20, 2024",0.0,0.0

I encountered many aqua-colored luminescent jelly fish floating in the water, but not the painful stinging kind so no worries. They were sooo beautiful. There were large cabanas and trees on the beach for shade and for stashing gear. If you come by motorbike or tuk tuk, don't leave anything unsecured with your vehicle because you will probably lose it to a monkey. The morning was especially nice as there were just a few people swimming. By mid afternoon, throngs of wild (but good natured) teenage boys descended onto the beach. This is a public space with lifeguards who will blow their whistle if they deem you too far from shore. Bummer because the sea is very shallow for a long, long way. I was there in March and at that time approximately 65% of the beach was cordoned off by the police/military. Reason unknown, but the restricted area consisted of a long crescent of premium beach including the coral reef. At that time it was not possible to go snorkeling. The photo that accompanies this listing shows the whole beach, including what is now restricted.

Lush scrub jungle reaches from the edge of the sand up the adjacent hill.

The lunch is basic but ok and not expensive at all. We had sandwiches. The beach has showers, toilets where you can change, a bar and umbrellas with sunbeds. It is usually very quiet. You can find very nice seashells and look for small fishes & crabs in the rocks or build a nice sand castle of course!","July 11, 2018",0.0,0.0

The beach bar was also clean and efficient and open to us.  Try the date smoothie and the mango smoothie; they were amazing.

I was pleasantly surprised how clean the beach despite it is the off season with high winds and rough sea. All credit should go to the Sri Lanka Air Force personnel who maintain this place. The beach is divided into two sections one for the day trippers  (fee charged) and he other half for exclusive use of resort residents. The bay overlook Trincomalee harbor and the Chalets overlook the sea. We were in the Banyan chalet, a rustic but with basic necessities  like Cable TV, fridge etc. In the background is a forested hill which I believe has good scenic lookouts though we were unable to climb due to seasonal rains. The Veranda of the chalet offers an uninterrupted view of the harbour the Islands. The far end of the  resort section of the beach is littered  with rocks, pebbles of varying size which get covered during high tide where one can spend hours observing marine life. The resort is an idyllic place to spend the day beginning with  the majestic sunrise and  the sea birds darting into water for prey in he evening. Apart from Whale watching, visits to interesting places in Trincomalee one can also visit the serene Welgam Vehera, a temple located about 15 mins drive from the resort. This temple built 2000 years ago was  almost vandalized by the LTTE terrorists. Food prepared by the the resort personnel was tasty and they make it a point to ask what we like for the next meal at every meal. We had very good Crab and Prawn Curry together with fresh vegetables. Fruits were in abundance and served with every meal.  The staff was extremely friendly to say the least. The only downside of our visit was the few mosquitoes bothering us perhaps due to puddles remaining after the rains. There was also slight offensive smell in the chalet on day one, which perhaps due to the cleaning liquids used. There are two main roads leading to this resort, the A6 and A12. On the A6 after Habarana town one could most often see wild elephants on either side of the main road enjoying the lush green grass especially in late afternoons. A12 road from Anuradhapura the ancient city to Trincomalee offer fantastic drive through the middle of two large reservoir Mahadivulwewa and MahaKanadarawa where kayaking is possible, and with a history dating back to 300AD. A large Crocodile was seen  sunbathing in one of the smaller village tank driving on A 12. Both these picturesque main routes, A 6 and A 12 have been renovated and rehabilitated beyond expectations after terrorism ended in May 2009.","February 19, 2015",0.0,0.0

It takes a 20 minute drive from Trico and you pay Rs 120 for people and car parking. It is run by the army but don't ask me why. We arrived 5 pm and there were many school children, including Muslim girls swimming in their full black regalia. The beach is in an inlet so is safe for swimming (there are areas marked with flags to make sure you did not stray). There are not that many good safe areas in Trico so you take it or leave it. It is only about 100m long with rocks either side so hardly expansive but good for supervised groups. PS Europeans have a bad reputation for unhealthy interest in children so males on their own should be careful of their 'looking' behaviour.

If you are a bunch of guys looking to go to the beach for the day, then you will love this place. The beach is clean, acceptable water conditions for a swim and even for snorkeling. The problems lie if there are women in the group and they tend to expose a little more skin than you would typically see in such a location. My sister was not even on the beach, and there was a military guy who was secretly filming her or taking pictures with his cell phone camera. You basically have a bunch of military men running a resort with no etiquette on being respectful to women. I can only imagine if a bunch of women were to travel to this location by themselves. Who is to know what could transpire? So given this experience, I would never encourage females and certainly not Westerners (women) to visit this so called ""resort"" in Trincomalee. There are other safer places to put on a bathing suit and enjoy a nice tan in Trincomalee without having perverts around you. They also have rooms for rent.

Food was excellent. The rooms were air conditioned, with hot and cold water, tea and coffee making facilities and a fridge. Although a bit small, mattresses are provided for up to 2 adults and 2 kids to sleep in a room. Two of the rooms in the bungalow had ensuite toilets and the room down stairs had a separate toilet. The view is out of this world !. A bit of a walk to the dining hall so would not recommend travelling for a holiday during the rainy season. The staff were very helpful and friendly, starting from the two Mr. Bandara's at the reception to Sanjeeve our Airforce Life guard who stood guard by us while we had sea baths and took us snorkeling. This Bungalow is ideal for 2-3 families with kids. However, double rooms are also available.","April 23, 2013",0.0,0.0

Waves are very mild - it really does not evoke the full sense of the sea. Strangely the water is not as salty either - possibly because the great Mahaweli River flows into the sea close by.

We wanted to have an evening at the beach with sun , sea and of course, lots of fun. Booking procedure was OK. I was able to talk to a nice guy at the reception and was able to get the rooms booked to individuals even before we lefty Kandy. There were 5 families. Finding the place is not a problem at all. The moment you pass the Kinniya bridge , there is a turn to the right , with a  sign board to the Hotel. The road is a bit run down, but not a big issue. There is a new construction going on right at the entrance , and one wonders whether you are at the correct place when you come out of the approach road through scrub jungle.  The initial impression is disappointing. But wait till you see Mr Jayakody and the beautiful, breathtaking , pristine beach.  These three elements make your despair disappear ! Be careful when you select the cabanas. Some are close to the restaurant, others are a bit further away  and places lonely in the jungle, and can be a  bit of a walk. Better to go for a cabana close to the rest of the world , if you are the less adventurous type like me who worry more about  Russel’ s vipers and saw scaled vipers ( we didn’t see any ) Unfortunately, the Marble see  was rough when we visited it. If you are a sea enthusiast, try to avoid September – January monsoon time. Eveybody from Mr Jayakdy,  down the line are very helpful. We had a sing song in the bar, with a calypso band. Dinner was great, It had everybody included. The vegetable soup was great. The other meals were simple but tasty and blended well . Probably in the future, there will be more variation. We couldn’t do Snorkeling  because of the bad weather. Rooms are a bit small and a bit run down. They are big enough as a double room. Not enough space  as a triple room. Overall, we had a fine stay in spite of the weather. The staff is friendly and  flexible and the prices reasonable. A bit more sophistication  and  refurbishing and maintenance  will make the place more comfortable. I’m sure this will be done in the time to com. Ideal place to go and have a rest with your spouse, a sea bath, some snorkeling, then may be a  cool bear before your dinner. Best of luck to Mr Jayakody and his team, and the Air Force for the great idea. Hope you will expand to include more customers.. Marble Beach AFRH, Thank you for the lovely evening.","December 5, 2012",0.0,0.0
