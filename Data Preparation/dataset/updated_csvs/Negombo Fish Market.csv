Best organized by the hotel/hostel by bike. That's how I did it. My guide was Asiri, the manager of the Ceylon Glory Hotel in Negombo. On the way we had stopped at the Dutch Fort and various temples and churches. The early morning from 6 am is best suited for this. Then it is still relatively cool (in November) , often sunny and busy. Later it can rain and the fishmongers/fishermen have disappeared.","December 17, 2025",0.0,0.0

The air is alive with the sounds of fishmongers shouting prices as they display their predawn catch on tables. The market is wet underfoot, with rows of fresh seafood laid out without ice. Nearby, on the sand between the stalls and the ocean, workers salt-cure fish. The process involves soaking the fish in concentrated salt for a week before laying them in the sun to dry. This labor-intensive task requires daily flipping and adding salt to ensure they dry properly. The fish are then taken indoors each night, and the entire drying process can take several days depending on the weather. Tip: Don’t wear flip-flops and avoid long clothing that will get wet and fishy.","November 4, 2025",0.0,0.0

But be warned. The smell of fish is so overpowering that some people may struggle as was the case with our group. This is one of the main places where local fishermen bring their daily catch. Miles and miles of all sorts of fish laid on the grounds for drying gives an overload to the senses. You can see lots of fresh fish being sold and also many  stalls selling fruits and vegetables by the side of the road.,"October 16, 2025",0.0,0.0

It’s an interesting place but very few tourists when I went so I felt quite out of place. I was approached by a persistent local seemed very friendly at first showing me the market and the ‘behind the scenes’ area. Never did he mention it being a tour. Being a solo female I felt quite uncomfortable as he led me very far away from the market itself. He took me to a restaurant for a drink but I declined. He then led me behind the restaurant (no one else around) where he demanded a tip in £££. I opted to give him some rupees but once he saw what I had, he demand more and got very argumentative.

We caught an uber down there from the hotel and from that point onwards we were hounded to do a tour with the locals, they approach and start talking about their methods and the fish then will offer a tour. If you decline a tour they get sour and quite rude, then when you walk to a different area you get to do it again. I would probably recommend organising a guide beforehand to avoid the endless hawking. I understand the need to try for money but it ruins the experience of going there.","September 28, 2025",0.0,0.0

The Dutch took over the Portuguese and built the fort (1672) and constructed the canal linking Negombo to Puttalam in the north and Colombo in the south, with the longest canal in Sri Lanka at 120km long. It is still operational today but barely used except for mooring some small fishing boats. The location of the city of Negombo at the junction of Negombo Lagoon and the open sea makes it the perfect spot for a fishing port to harvest lobsters, crabs and prawns from the lagoon and a huge variety of fish from the ocean. There are 2 fish markets in Negombo, a small one south of the entrance to the lagoon, across the lagoon bridge, and the much larger one, Lellama (= place of bargain), to the north. Lellama is the second largest fish market in Sri Lanka and the largest auction. Open every day, except Sundays, it is a lively place from about 5am, when the larger fishing boats return from the nights fishing, until late afternoon, or until all the fish are sold. Smaller outrigger canoes deliver their catch usually later in the morning. The best of the catch, especially the much prized lobsters, is usually bought up quickly by the big hotels and restaurants by auction on the beach or by prior arrangement. Later in the day is when the locals come to buy fish from the market women for their supper. For tourists, it is an interesting place to spend about an hour, to visit at almost any time, although mid-morning may be the best time, to observe the many types of fish brought in for sale ranging from sharks, rays, Barracuda, Tuna and grouper to octopus, squid, cuttlefish, live crabs, mullet, reef fish, prawns and fingerlings and many other varieties in between. Lots of noise, colour, sizes, shapes and smells. It can get slippery underfoot so its unwise to go barefoot or even wearing sandals. The extensive beach in front of the fish market is usually covered with fish drying in the hot sun and plundered by crows and seagulls. Here you can also observe fishermen repairing and preparing their nets and boats for tomorrows fishing trip. Unfortunately you will also find a lot of plastic and other beach garbage.","April 20, 2018",0.0,0.0

Most boatmen bring their catches in quite early am, and dealers from all over buy direct either to take back to their shops, restaurants, hotels,etc, or to sell on as the Market gets busier later in the morning.  Be warned, Health & Safety/Hygiene has no place here. Everything is sold as seen, and their are various sections of the market were you can get your bought fish gutted, trimmed and prepared to take home for dinner, or whatever.  The smell is overpowering, there are dogs and cats walking around looking for scraps,lots of birds also and the ground can be quite squelchy at times, so sturdy shoes a must.

The market with its shore-front carpeted with hessian mats coated in salt with fish drying. The fish are heavily coated in salt which deters flies and animals and turned for 2 days until dry, when they're boxed up and dispatched throughout the country. The fish caught on boats or hauled from the shore in nets, usually by families working together, can be sold fresh for a day or 2, but after that they'd be wasted, so the salting process preserves the tons of fish brought daily to the market. On the day we visited we were approached and, educated by Jokim Bernard (apologies for probably incorrect spelling) - his biggest claim to fame - showing Rick Stein around the market; but as he's been a part of this market for many years, there's not a fish or person in the market he doesn't know. So, to see tuna, swordfish, snappers,mullet, white fish, sardines and shellfish well worth a visit. When it all gets too much enjoy some fresh and refreshing coconut. Whilst in Negombo visit the prison (outside only) - the 19th century Colonial prison is in ruins replaced by a modern one, but not a place you'd ever want to be. Fish and prisons too much, then retire for a drink at Serendib, a pub and sea food restaurant whose rear courtyard opens onto the beach and sea. Finish with a boat trip on the Dutch Canal and look out for water monitor lizards and brilliantly coloured kingfishers.

We didn't visit other fish markets in Sri Lanka, but this was enjoyable to visit and the people were friendly. We arrived at at 6am, just before other tourists started to show up. Local fishermen unloading their haul of big tuna encouraged us to come on the boat and see up close as they worked. Another man was using a syringe-like device to sample the big fish as they were unloaded, weighed and sold, and gave us a taste, which was about as fresh as you can get without jumping in the sea and biting the fish as it swims by. We were lucky enough to get some wasabi from a Japanese fellow tourist to go with it. Delicious. For R200 we bought a hunk of raw tuna cut off a fish right in front of us, for an unusual snack for the road later. Worth 30 minutes to start your morning.","January 24, 2017",0.0,0.0

Next to it there is an informal set up for various traders of vegetables and fruit. The beach next to the market is usually covered by fish laid out for drying. This market seems to be aimed at the public as a retail outlet rather than a wholesale market. That role is taken by the other fish market. Here there is one advantage in that there is no busy road running right through the middle of the market unlike the wholesale one. What is sad though is that the general impression is one of untidy chaos. The cleaning up after a day of trading is sporadic at best and the rubbish bins mostly broken flow over and smell before they are emptied.

It's busy and noisy and there are fish bits everywhere you look but totally fascinating to watch. The fish is gutted and prepared for drying in an age-old method by women working with seriously sharp tools. Inside the fish market itself is an education with fresh fish of every type on display. The big dealers barter for the best deals in a crowd of interested buyers and it's noisy, colourful, wet, a bit smelly but ultimately fascinating. Watch out when taking photos as the fisher women expected payment which we didn't have and that was awkward. The people are so nice and they get on with their work while we tourists wander about looking at them so a small payment wouldn't go amiss. Wish we'd known. You can buy whatever you fancy if you have the means to cook it and  we saw lots of people doing so. The visit  continued with a boat trip down Dutch Canal which was so lovely and natural. Very lush and exotic environment along the riverside and we saw every species ( and more) advertised on the tour from kingfishers to water lizards.

We were wondering around the small market when a local fisherman named Jockim Bernard started talking to us in very good English. He explained to us that he had been the guide around the fish market for Chef Rick Stein a few years ago so we were instantly interested to find out more. He gave us his own small tour and explained all the different fish/seafood, pricing, auctioning and how to make dry fish. I would recommend trying to find him for a quick tour if you are not so clued up on fish like us.

Sue finished up buying a huge amount of very pale green lace curtain at a price you'd probably pay for just a couple of metres in the UK. Being white some stallholders hike up the price, we had the benefit of Ushan and his wife Palika who said yeah or nay and ocassionally she'd get the price then we pay. Back to the main point, Ushan asked if we wanted to go into the fish market, a large building set to one side. I wasn't particularly bothered nor was Sue but as we were almost stood outside it we decided to go in. The smell hits you before the sights, if you are a person with a weak stomach, stay away. The sight inside is unbelievable, every  type of fish and sea creature you can imagine layed out in small and large quantities, all were swimming about quite happily hours before. Some traders had just one very large fish, Tuna or Searfish I think, stakes were cut off these for customers who indicated how much they wanted by pointing to a place to cut. Now for the highlight, if you've braved the smell you now need to stomach the flys, thousands of them, traders do waft the fish, the fly's depart.........for 5 seconds then land back on it or decide they'll try the next stall. After seeing it you can appreciate why it's so important to cook food properly and maintain a high standard of personal hygiene. All in all the market itself is well worth a visit, take some water with you it gets very hot and very busy. Try and brave the fish market so you can get your stripe, been there and done that.
