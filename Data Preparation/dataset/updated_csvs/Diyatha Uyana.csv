It is a man made greenery where you tend to forget that it is Colombo. The walking paths and the dashing waters at a side, the well maintained grass and the planted trees are perfect supporters of your joy jog even if you're alone or with a crowd. Parents love bringing their kids in here as there's so much to feel in this child friendly environment. There's an aquarium which I personally don't like to visit as I do not like to see caged animals. Plus there are shops nicely lined up which offer food and drinks, souvenirs, gifts, flowers, handicrafts, plants, toys and many more. Seating area is simply amazing that surprisingly you will not see a bit of waste or food leftovers on the floor. Myself and friends frequently visit there and we find many wedding photo-shoots; not to mention how odd looking they are. No matter how much crowd is there your privacy will not be disturbed by them. Nobody will even care to look at you for they are so busy to enjoy the wonderful experience of the site. There is a section where you will see the Deer, Stag,Tortoise, Ducks and a few more animals for the sight of visitors. The water ways that surrounds the section contains some wild fish which I don't know the name of. That was the most stunning experience of the visit I had. You will find McDonald's once you exit the park and even if you're using public transport you not be hassled as the buses go right in front of the park.

This recreational attraction consists of beautiful reservoir banks with interlock paved boardwalk surrounded by ever green grass, flea market style marketplace, an open air food court, plenty of paved parking, a fountain that keeps the kids intrigued with its colorful display of water jets at night, a floating restaurant and an aquarium under the tent. The water body itself serves an important purpose of draining and storing floodwater. It has been comprehensively dredged for effectiveness and now attracts small sailboats and oarsmen practicing recreational and competitive rowing. Swimming is not advised here and probably not allowed. This is a busy attraction with people lounging on the grass, families visiting with children while others seem to stop by for supper. Busiest times are evenings with traffic queueing up for parking as the sun sets. It is advisable to avoid this attraction whenever there is a function in the area involving VIP convoys, to avoid unannounced diversions, restrictions on movement and the general inconvenience of panicked policing. The marketplace offers goods that sell fast and carry items like the Rangala House range of sun-dried tomatoes, tahini etc. The food court offers some diversity but an evident lack of quality control and standards mean you should exercise prudence in your choice. There is no fee for this popular attraction and it is a good opportunity to observe a subsection of Sri Lankan society. It is safe for families and kids but beware of your belongings. The boardwalk offers the opportunity for a brisk walk or jog while you take turns entertaining the kids. Enjoy the corniche!","January 10, 2014",0.0,0.0
