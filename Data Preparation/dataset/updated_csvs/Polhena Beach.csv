There is not much infrastructure nearby, except for one cafe that offered sunbeds - on the day of 1000 rupees, Sunbeds put palm trees in shade and you can order drinks there only. But there's not much shadow. Well, those who don't want to pay fold their towels in the sand and relax. It's all safe. The beach isn't very big, but there's plenty of room for everyone, especially liked to check out the locals, as they don't like the waves and just snort. There's also a spot on the beach where you can buy all sorts of inflatable things and snorkelling equipment, Lifeguards are also near their station.

We couldn't find anyone hiring out snorkels on the beach, so best to bring your own or borrow from your hotel if you can. Head there in the morning. There were very few people around. Spend 15 mins towards the back of the bay (you'll see the rocks coming out of the water) and you'll have an amazing time swimming with these beautiful creatures.

After trying twice and failing twice I decided to get a guide. The cost was virtually nothing, but as soon as I was in the water the guide zoned in on a Olives Ridley turtle and there he was, plucking grass from the seabed and passing the food t me, to pass to the turtles. I don't necessarily agree with this hand feeding by tourists but I think this little act could be helping the turtles to stay popular, which in turn encourages locals to protect their investment and keep the beaches clean. I was called to the beach one particular evening by a Tuk-Tuk driver and I actually saw a turtle laying her eggs. Truly spectacular. The turtle had a big scar on its back due to, I was told, a shark attack. I sat in a small restaurant one day for several hours and watched the feeding turtles' heads popping up and down in the surf, without any interruption or intervention from humans. There is very little input from humans here and I think it is one of the best places in the whole of Sri Lanka to view these several different species of beautifully wild sea creatures.","February 11, 2023",0.0,0.0

I had a very very good guided snorkling tour. With Dilib, you can ask about him at Sunil Rest guesthouse. I was just 3 steps into the sea and all around me where turtles swimming. you could really swim and play with the turtles, feed them. It was amazing to swim with the turtles. They really seemed to enjoy it. They did not swim away. Also we swam to the coral reef and saw many colorfull fish and living coral reef. It was amazing. a guided snorkling tour is not expensive at all. You just need a day of clear water. You can also take your own snorkling gear or rent snorkling gear. We are no great swimmers, but my child and me already with our own snorkling gear not far in the sea could see many coloured fish. So highly recommended. also many beaches in Sri Lanka are not safe for swimming for small children.

You don’t need any “tour package” to see the turtles. Get there and jump into the sea and you will see plenty of them. All you need to do is bargain a little with the locals for the gear renting and guide you to see the turtles (if you are not confident to look for it on your own) I strongly suggest you wear the snorkeling shoe / take the fins as the sea bed is very rough and I saw some sea urchins hiding around the corals and thank God I didn’t hit one when I was bare foot in the sea. Well I only saw turtles around and no fishes, so I am not sure this kind of snorkeling will meet your expectation. The corals are craps, are those even corals, I wasn’t sure. However, I enjoyed the snorkeling as you are literally swimming with them. Another side note: the current was strong though it is shallow, maybe I went there after the heavy rain.

But the Polhena Bay Resort offers a very small but a much calmer beach. You must definitely take the snorkelling tour with Nirosh (0775481252). He has 29 years experience and very sharp eyes. Although the corals are unfortunately all dead he was able to show us many different animals and provided useful information. It was not one of the typical touristy boat snorkelling tours. We basically started to swim along the corals and saw so many happy turtles. Please respect wild life and don’t touch them!!!

Local people are nice and friendly, some nice hotels are also here. It is a very clean beach. Alcohol not allowed anywhere in the open public in Sri Lanka and you will not get trouble here.  Generally it is an awesome Polhena beach. It is a wonderful place to have a safe, natural sea bath. Coral seemed mostly dead, and water was very shallow.  It is a very small beach, not ideal for whole day to hang on. There are lots of local people mostly doing swimming and bathing in the sea. The surrounding places and accommodations are nice. Select a great place and get into the water but do not go no further beyond your chest height level of water, if you are looking for a safe swimming beach. You can see corals, turtles and more of the marine creatures if you are lucky. There was some small colorful fishes, it is more a local beach than a touristic one as the locals are many in numbers. We had a nice overall experience. The beach becomes noisy due to overcrowding with local people who play around and sing and enjoy. The crowds of people plus the pollution from the Matara Nilwala River have all but spoiled the sights of marine life above and below the water.   Avoid weekends as the place is heavily crowded. If you want to have a calm sea bath go early in the morning. The beach is very scenic too.  Now you have to pay for parking and there are lot of shops.

Matara is connected to Colombo via a Southern expressway so your travel time is just 2 hours. You do not have to enter Matara town. You will exit the southern expressway and head towards Matara town. In the second signal (T-junction) turn right into the Galle road and you will have to drive for about 3 kms. it is also connected by train. Train journey will take about 3 1/2 hours. Most part of train journey is close to the sea coast and there are many a time during the journey you can see beaches from the train. From Matara town or train station you can take a tuk tuk for less than 500 LKR. You can also take a local bus that goes to Weligama or Galle and take a tuk tuk from the main road. To reach the beach you will have to drive less than a km from the main road ( Matara - Galle road). the road close to the beach will be narrow so you will have to give way for the on coming traffic by pulling aside. Parking should not be a problem. You also have a bathing place where you can shower and change after you swim in the beach. There are hotels available if you want to stay overnight or spend a couple of days there. For us it was a day trip so we did not explore this. Neither did we explore the restaurants since we packed our lunch and snakcs. There are also shops selling you beach wears so you do not have to worry if you are not carrying one. The water will be only about waist high till the reef formation. You can swim safely . Even a person who did not know swimming was able to enjoy myself in the water for more than 2 hours with no fear of drowning. if you are looking for surfing this may not be the place for you. There are also no shades where you can camp on the shore. So you need to carry a beach umbrella to set up camp.,"March 2, 2018",0.0,0.0

Probably one of the better once in Sri Lanka. There are coast guards as well therefore there is some safety. However it is packed by locals who come in bus loads. They are not very environmentally cautious as well. They throw the food wrappers empty bottles here and there. This spoils your whole experience. Also roads are very narrow and having big local tourist busses on these roads doesn't help the traffic. We did a second visit the next morning (early). Very pleasant with less crowd and calm seas( normally calm in the morning). There is no proper restaurants in close proximity.

Every morning he enters the nice garden of Polhena Village Beach Resort, posting himself on the balustrade overlooking the ocean. Whenever he takes his fins and snorkeling mask, he is ready to know the direction. If you want to meet the turtles under water - follow him! Everybody, honestly everybody  who came back from a snorkeling tour with Nirosh was very happy, and so was I, when I met a huge (1-2 meters) friendly looking, smoothly floating turtle, touching her shield and following her for some minutes from here to there. Synchronously swimming with such a impressing animal is an amazing feeling. (No need to bring your own snorkeling equipment, you can rent it here.) If you rather go on a river safari watching crocodiles, birds and monkeys Nirosh's eyes swap from turtle eye (his own nick name) to crocodile eyes.

The beach is best to explore during the morning and you can walk to the coral reef which has got diverse marine life. The shallow water is so calm during the mornings and there won't be any waves. The see is very safe for children and make sure you stay on the safe zones to prevent currents which are there slightly away from the Polhena reef.

As this is a public beach take your map out and go visit it. Its not hard to find the beach front and you just have to take the left turn from the Polhena Junction which directly goes to the beach. So this beach is exceptional compared to other beaches in the Southern Coast line. Polhena Beach is covered by a natural rock wall which has made the beach in to a natural pool. You can barely see waves within 200M and It's pretty safe to swim close to the beach (But do no go too far, as there are some underwater swirls time to time) . As I was schooling we had swimming contests in the beach by converting the beach in to a Pool by partitioning it with lines.
