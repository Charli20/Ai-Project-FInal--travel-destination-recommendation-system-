The main road is not in the best of conditions, but passable even by a low ground clearance vehicle. It is relatively narrow. But two vehicles can pass through in most places. It can get congested during long weekends and during the season and you might end up in long traffic jams. To reach the peak/ point known as ""riverston"" you have to park the vehicle on the side of the road and take a small hike on a tarred road. Parking is limited and it's one reason for the traffic jams on crowded days. We went in June, i.e in the off season, and the title summarizes our experience of riverston!  It was covered in mist the whole day, the mist also carried a lot of water and there was quite heavy winds. On the plus side, this meant that the temperature remained below 20c the whole day. Otherwise I believe it could have been  quite a hot climb during the season. The round trip of the hike took us about 45 mts despite the quite strong winds, a small drizzle and poor visibility. But the path was quite clear and spacious. We did notice one hiker having a problem with leeches but it was probably because she was wearing slippers. Nevertheless it would be a good idea to keep to the tarred path, away from the grass and wear covered shoes. We always apply excessive amounts of Siddhalepa on our shoes and feet where ever we hike which has always worked for us. You to purchase a ticket from the entrance for locals it was around LKR 75 per person if I remember correctly. We loved our off season experience. The only downside was that the wind was also quite loud and continued throughout the night and most of the day. It was even loud enough to keep us awake at night. But that was probably because our hotel was only 1km away from riverston. The wind and mist was there only at the high point near riverston. It would dissipate as soon as you pass it, both towards raththota and illukumbuta side. This route also offers you many other attractions like bambarakiriella waterfall (before you get to riverston), pitawala pathana, sera ella waterfall, a bathing spot in the Thelgamu river and the Kalu ganga reservoir dam. This road now goes all the way up to Giradurukotte, crossing a new bridge over Mahaweli river, spanning over vastly different climates and terrains. The drive itself a wonderfully scenic experience despite the not so ideal road conditions.","July 28, 2024",0.0,0.0

From the main road you need to turn off and drive for nearly 12 km where the last 1.5 km is a rugged road, ideal for an SUV.

The unique feature is that you can go behind the fall fall and watch the water falling by standing on the rock plate. Th pool of water which falls is not suitable for bathing as it may be dangerous but the pool itself is extremely beautiful with forest cover around the pool as well as the water fall. THOUGH DURING THE DRY SEASON THERE IS LESS WATER, DURING THE MONSOONS, it gives a beautiful sheet of water to make it panoramic. The trip to Rivestan itself is beautiful with all Knukles mountain ranges surrounding you. If you happen to go up to riverstan , you should not miss a visit to Sera ella.
