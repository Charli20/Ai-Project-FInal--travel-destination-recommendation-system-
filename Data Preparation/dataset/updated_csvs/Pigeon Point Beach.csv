This year for my birthday all I wanted to do was just relax on the beach for the week and I got to do exactly that this year. My partner and I got the Chillaxx package (please see photos for prices) which was a great deal for the week while we stayed there. The staff on the beach were always very friendly and helpful. I was pleasantly surprised to see that there was a hut that made pies. Their aloo pie and beef pie was very tasty and reasonably priced. I have a favourite spot that I like to have my chairs at and it is closer to the rocks and farther away from the jetty. My family had complained about their being a drop off, which made it hard for them to get in and out of the water back during Easter. My partner and I did not experience any of that this time we went and it was easy for us to get in and out of the water and there were young children there as well and they didn’t have any problem. My friend was vacationing in Tobago during the summer and spoke about a lot of seaweed coming into shore. Again, my partner and I did not experience any of this. There was actually very little seaweed. There were a lot of fishes in the ocean coming right up to shore, which I’ve never experienced this amount before. It made for a very interesting experience as there were random yelps and it cost quite a few bathers off guard.","October 21, 2025",0.0,0.0

It's the jump off spot for No Man's Land, Bucco Reef, Nylon Pool boat trips.  You pay a small entry fee to use the beach and the facilities.  You then have to pay for the umbrella, beds, chairs, cabins or bring your own stuff and try and find shade. Due to motorsports accidents there is now an area cordoned off by buoys, make sure you use this area as there are jet skis, fishermen, glass bottom boats everywhere. Don't jump off the end of the jetty - a Caribbean Island Pilot jumped off last week and broke his neck in 2 places as he hit a rock. It's relaxing, but loud, everyone playing different music, but that's the vibe - people are relaxed and there are places serving food (fast food) and drinks.  Some nice shops at the back, check out the pottery/ceramic shop they have beautiful windchimes. AVOID Cruise Ship Day - check the forecast as it will heaving and change the vibe.","March 26, 2025",0.0,0.0

The beach is worth all the hype, typical Caribbean views, soft sand and turquoise coloured waters!! Get there early 'to bag' an umbrella there are only 25 for the whole beach. Sun loungers are very good. Two restaurants at either end selling decent food and cold beer! The showers and toilets were excellent. And the chaps putting out the beds worked really hard all day.

It is kept clean and well maintained and there are lifeguards. Chaise lounges and umbrellas can be rented. There are also no vendors bothering you on the beach. However, it is a bit too commercialized for my liking as I prefer more authentic less developed beaches. Additionally, it is an extremely popular beach, maybe the most popular on Tobago and it can get busy.  It's not a place for peace and quiet but is a place to have fun.

The entrance fee is TTD 20 per person and we hired 2 sunbeds and 1 sun brolly for a total of TTD120. They were set up  right on the front of the beach and were in good condition. The beach itself was very clean and there were areas where you could shade under the trees if preferred. Their were well maintained toilets and showers, an ice cream booth and 2 bars (one at either end of the beach). I would estimate that the beach stretches out for around 400m. The sea was relatively calm and there are a couple of small coral sand steps to negotiate entering and exiting the sea. There is a protective boundary for safe swimming as there are various boats and jet skis around. It's a great location for adults and families.

The place was surprisingly spacious, with a large dining/living room and the bedrooms were located at the far end, ensuring quiet sleep time and privacy. We could sit in our yard or cross the road to enjoy the gorgeous sunsets on an unpopulated stretch of beach. The walk to the main beach, which we enjoyed every day was a short distance and well worth the jaunt. It was a 10 minute walk down the road, where there was a bar and you could enjoy a beverage while overlooking the water. A few steps further and you could purchase traditional food for lunch or take it home for dinner from the little huts that are there. Continue walking on Pigeon Point Road to the roundabout and turn right. There are many restaurants with different cuisine to choose from. Our favourite was Debe Delights. You could get Doubles or Allo Pie for an equivalent of $1.00CAD. Keep going past Kodi’s Natural Treats, but stop at the next restaurant and say hello to Shelly. She makes a delicious jerk chicken, oxtail stew and bbq’d chicken, among other things. Don’t forget to order “Festivals” they are delicious.  It cannot go unsaid how our host, Ana, at the bungalow went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable. Although the accommodations could only be described as “tired and needing updated” Ana made every effort to upgrade items in the kitchen to make it more appealing. When we had trouble with out fridge, she had someone there to fix it as soon as she could. Also, the wifi didn’t work and although she could not fix it during our stay, she allowed us to use her wifi at the office, so that we could send messages to our families. Her warm greeting always welcomed us when we saw her.

Glass bottom boat tours are available from about 100TT pp, but we negotiated a more private day-long tour with a great guy called Anton. For 500TT pp he took us on a coastline tour by speedboat. We snorkelled in 3 different places, including the famous Buccoo Reef. The coral and fish were incredible! We also visited the Nylon Pool, and had a delicious bbq lunch on the beach on No Man’s Island.

It is a flat, easy walk and takes about 20 minutes. There is fee to get in, but I didn't mind paying. It was small in comparison to beaches/parks where I live. (I won't get into too many details as they have already been said.) The water was beautiful and occasionally my foot did hit a piece of coral, but for the most part it was smooth sand. I wasn't bothered by too many vendors. A nice ""no thank you"" was all that was needed. There was a little ice cream stand that had some of the best ice cream. The bathrooms and changing rooms were very nice. Just be careful as the floors can get slippery.  A young boy did slip and busted his head open while I was there. It was nice to walk towards the end of park and watch the kite surfers. I enjoyed playing pool at the first bar/restaurant when I needed a break from the sun. I loved walking back right after sunset because along the road (in the park) I always got to encounter  hummingbirds at the flowering bushes. They would let you get so close. I imagine some of the people driving by thought i was a bit strange talking to bushes as they may not have seen the birds lol. Tips: If you comb the beach before and after the event pavilion, you can find lots of sea glass and beautiful shells. Very quiet along there too so great photo opportunities or if you need solitude.","January 2, 2020",0.0,0.0

There is Store Bay which is closer to the airport and free. Pigeon Point is further out and has a small entrance fee. I decided on this since i figured its more relaxing. I was right and glad I made the decision. I'm a fairly quick walker even with my 20lb backpack. If it weren't for all the stops i took to look at things, i would have been about 30 minutes.

Beers were 15 TTB + various cocktails for a bit more. There was also full menu available. I did BBQ chicken and sides for take away 55 TTB. It wasn't too crowded at the beach which was what I wanted.

Later that day one guy tried to sell a tour but he left me alone after i told him I was just there for the day. The water was calm and enjoyable just to float around.

Go early grab a beach hut, food, drinks water sports, sun beds all available. I was very upset when some tourists cane back to me and told me that you now have to pay for the beach huts. I checked the web site ... beach huts free.... I entered into a discussion with Pigeon Point and I was informed that you now have to pay for the huts. I informed them that the correct procedure in such matters would have been to amend the web site then place the charge. The web site was amended Having a group of people here I decided to rent one of the huts for the day.... and truthfully it was quite disgusting. The same tired huts that were free are now being charged for.. with the same broken trellis work round it... the same huts severely needing a bit of tlc. You pay a very small entrance fee to the park supposedly for the upkeep and the facilities. The toilets were absolutely filthy.

Our hotel on Tobago was just awful (review to come when I've calmed down!) but they did provide a free shuttle bus to Pigeon Point to which we escaped many times on our trip to Tobago, often taking a picnic with us.  It is stunning with powder white sands and all the facilities you could wish for.  There is a small entrance fee to pay and sunbeds for hire.  The rules and regs here are quite strict but are respected by all visitors and it is litter free and very tidy.  The beach to the right is lovely but if you turn left to the turtle nesting side (not laying during our visit) but no sunbeds for hire you find the sands even more incredible and you can walk all the way along the beach to chat with the local fishermen and see the antics of many pelicans crammed on the boats! The sea is crystal clear but not much to see if you snorkel.  The whole area has a very beach party atmosphere but never intrusive if you want some peace and quiet.  The weather during our stay was exceptional and it was lovely to sit and watch everyone, young and old alike enjoying themselves.

We went jet skiing here which was very fun, but it was around wind surfers which you had to be cautious. They were offered at Store Bay as well which probably would have been more fun. People were very friendly. We had some crab and dumplings at the little restaurant. Not my favorite- little bits of shells in the meat.

You pay $20TT per adult and $10 for kids 5 to 12 years old, under 5 years -free. The actual food, ice cream, drinks and physical beach are all super! The beach staff act as if you are bothering them, if you buy ice cream, the attendant acts bothered to get off her phone to prepare it, the grilled food people act bothered to prepare your order and worst of the all is the lounge chair police. So there is a rule governing the use of loung chairs, so be aware. First you pay someone for a lounge chair, $30TT, the person you pay is not the same person who distributes the lounge chair. The lounge chair staff are always moving around so you have to look for them. You will receive a wristband for the chair, if you are with a group of people, two persons cannot sit on a loung chair, only one adult at a time , the adult with the wrist band. So My husband and I had two chairs, my 3 year old is eating on one and my husband and I are sitting facing opposite directions on the other one, this was pointed out as a violation of the loung chair policy. Another day, we were there, my toddler fell asleep in my arms, I asked my husband to get a chair so our son can sleep on it. It took him 30 mins to find the staff operating the lounge chair. We really did not want to participate in the lounge chair politics, but to have someplace comfortable for my son to sleep, we decided to go through the stress. When my husband couldn’t wait any more cause my arm was so tired, he took the chair then lounge chair police showed up. Then there was the table/bench usage. So my party consisted of 8 persons, two cars, we occupied two tables /4 benches. We were told by the staff we could only occupy one table even though we were buying lunch and had 8 persons with us. So many more examples, but you get the picture. The employees there, not sure if they are trained adequately to deal with tourists. They act as if you are bothering them and it seems they dont want you there. They act brothered and angry. If you can ignore the service, this place is great","April 9, 2018",0.0,0.0

There is a small charge to get in which is worth every penny as it keeps all the hawkers out so nobody bothers you. The gardens are beautiful and kept up immaculately clean. The beach toilets are the cleanest l have ever seen and are kept clean and restocked all day. There are sun beds for hire which cost about £1 a day and they will put them where you want. There is plenty of shade given by the trees so umbrellas are not needed. The sea temperature when l was there was so warm you weren't really sure you were in the water. Not much to see in the water as the reef here has been destroyed. Very sad but there are lots of people selling trips out to the reef to go snorkeling which are well worth it. Not for the faint hearted as the currents are very strong and you have to hold a rope all the time but great fun. There are 2 bars and a great wind surfing centre on the beach so food and drink is available all day. Would recommend this beach to everyone it is gorgeous.,"March 5, 2018",0.0,0.0

The only ""negative"" thing I will say about Pigeon Point is that if you are going to Tobago in high season or when there is a cruise ship in port, you must get there early or you risk not getting a lounger, umbrella or even a decent spot to put your towel!!

It’s raw/ rustic and un-commercialized ways set it apart from everywhere else in the Caribbean I’ve personally visited. Pigeon point is a great private beach.  Cost is 20tt pp to enter. You get a wristband. Our hotel (the Magdalena Grand) offered a free shuttle to the beach two times per day which was handy. Beach is well maintained. No Seagrass issues. Water is calm and warm. Caribbean Sea side There are jet skis available for rent. We paid $480tt for 1 hour through Justin / Terry.  $240 tt for half an hour.  Was a great experience !! If your thinking of doing Nylon Pool / No Mans land while you are there I would recommend going this route vs the glass bottom boat tour Also did the glass bottom boat tour via Terry / Power 2 boat cost $110tt pp.   It seemed to me that our boat we were on was not as nice as some of the others around (Cool Runnings) but really I think any boat you go on would’ve fine. They all do the same thing. There are a few bars / restaurant take out options on the beach.   We mostly got drinks and ice cream. The ice cream shop there has the best homemade coconut ice cream!! Get some. Ask Terry to bring you to the roti place (Trinbago Curry House) down the road ($100tt for a massive roti!) or to bring you local food.  So yummy and cheap. He will bring it to you right on the beach. If you need or want a driver or a hook up with anything while in this area, call or msg Terry.  He works the pier area and is amazing to deal with.   Tell him Connie from Canada sent you.  He has connections for anything you need and can bring you any place you like. Great trustworthy driver.

The food is good there though.","June 22, 2017",0.0,0.0

If you’re staying in the Crown Point/Store Bay area, then easiest and probably most cost-effective way to get here is to stand on Milford road and flag down a local taxi who will charge you about TT$20 for a short-drop. A proper taxi will be about $50 one-way. Entry is $20 each and $30 each to rent a lounger (!). So cost to get to and from Pigeon Point and to just sit on the beach is about TT$140 to TT$200 (US$30) for a couple. There are a few wooden benches but these fill up fast so you have no chance to secure any spot to sit if you go after 11am. When we visited it was so crowded! Most people couldn’t even find a patch of sand to spread a towel! They say that the huts are available but the majority were cordoned off with caution tape. There were people like ants! Piece of advice: If you’re looking for a peaceful day at Pigeon point then don’t go on Friday, Saturday or Sunday! Best if you could arrange your return transport when you get dropped off as it’s pot luck really if there happens to be a taxi waiting and available to take you back to your hotel. Decent food options like Traditions Restaurant which serves Shell-less curried crab & dumplings! Yum! There’s local food being served as well as a fast food place and several bars, and even an ice cream place. The water was freezing cold when we visited. The water was murky – it’s not as clear as it used to be. Also, there were lots of bits of coral and seaweed underfoot which made bathing somewhat unpleasant. But Pigeon Point is a cool place for liming and people-watching even if you’re not swimming. I’d say if you’re taxiing there and back, bring about TT$500 cash to cover your transport, lounging and food needs, more if you’re planning to patronise the souvenir shops.","March 19, 2017",0.0,0.0

It has a bit of everything parts of the beach are reserved for bathers of course, water sport enthusiasts, party people, families and for those like me who just wanted to take a leisurely walk. Pigeon Point is not at all far from Milford Road the main road where everything is in Crown Point so please DO NOT get conned into hiring a cab to take you there as you can easily walk it in about 15 minutes. I spent a good while strolling along taking photographs and drinking in the magnificent scenery with my eyes. Some cliches are good, in this case it was exactly like a postcard with palm trees, white sand and a cool breeze caressing your skin. If you are driving into Crown Point there is a 20 TTD admission fee to use the facilities. I was walking along the beach there was no charge for me naturally. To be honest I thought the charge to be rather cheeky as there was nowhere for me to place my things safely in order to take a dip in the incredibly inviting water. If you're in a group fine, as you can leave belongings with your people. If you are alone however then you are left with no choice but to forego a swim, a shame really. There are places to eat and drink which were constantly busy when I was there and a really good atmosphere as people ate, drank and listened to music. When you keep on walking you'll pass all the folks windsurfing, jet skiing and the like then further on from there the beach gets progressively quieter and quieter until you find yourself completely alone which I loved. I walked about as far as I possibly could; took some photos then turned back walking the entire length of the beach once again grabbing a few cold drinks on the way to the thick of things in town. I had a great tranquil, meditative time there though disappointed I could not enjoy the water as one can in Store Bay a beach that I prefer a little better than this one.

It is located on Tobago's south-western coast.  It is about 2 km walk from the Tropikist hotel where we were staying. Just walk along the main road past Milford Fort past Crown Point Hotel and Store Bay beach, past the Coco Reef Hotel and look for the signs ( Pigeon Point road branches off from Milford Road) or ask someone the way as everyone knows Pigeon Point. The white sandy beach is beautiful and there  are excellent beach facilities such as bathrooms, showers and beach-chair rentals as well as bars and a restaurant. Boat trips can be booked from here as well. It is open from 9am to 5pm and costs 20 TT for adults (about £2.25) and 10 for children to get in. You can apparently buy a weekly ticket if you want to go every day. There  are souvenir and water-sports shops and lifeguards are on duty. On the way to Pigeon Point you can stop at other smaller beaches that you do not need to pay for, however at least one visit is worth it just to see what it has to offer.","February 12, 2017",0.0,0.0

We shared a taxi from the port with another couple and agreed a three hour stay with the driver.  In fact I think he parked up and had a wee siesta! There is a $3 US per person fee to get in as it is a park and thus greater security and cleaner although it wasn't spotless.  The toilets, changing rooms and external showers were free and clean and very welcome to rinse off the salt.  There are a few kiosks and bars but with the GBP exchange rate being very poor, on account of the Brexit vote (not me!) we found the prices for food and drink very high and the hire of the beach beds and umbrellas equally so.  You can of course just put your mat or towel on the sand as many did. The day was very windy but the beach closest to the entrance was sheltered although the sea too stirred up for snorkelling.  Around the corner at the northern beach it was very rough and being enjoyed by lots of wind and kite surfers.  A lovely place and I also found my 1000th geocache just outside the entrance gate which was fun.","February 9, 2017",0.0,0.0

A box of chips and Carib were $15TT each, which we thought was reasonable for the location. There are a number of huts which are well maintained and provide good shelter, with plenty of tables and benches under trees as well. There were also a number of  life guards on patrol, and the water sports salesmen were friendly and not too pushy. The water was lovely and we had an amazing glass bottom boat trip snorkelling on the reef and swimming in the nylon pool with Rennie from Ringo Tours on his boat Three Tri & First Tri. Unfortunately, the owners seem to be relying on reputation and should make more of an effort as the #1 beach in Tobago. For example, the lovely golden sandy beach was not swept and was covered in leaves, seaweed and fag ends. The $18 chairs advertised on the website had clearly not been available for some time. One of the toilet blocks was out of use. Shops are understaffed with the ice cream seller closed for lunch.
