Apart from the Temple of the Tooth and Kandy Lake, there's lot to explore in the city.  And the best way to explore Kandy is definitely by Tuk Tuk. You not only avoid the traffic jams, but also receive the best local knowledge at a fraction of the cost of organised tours. Our Tuk Tuk driver Saman was brilliant - warm, friendly and very knowledgeable - one the best in Sri Lanka (Whats App +94 72 290 9182).  Saman took us to through the amazing meat, fish and vegetable markets in central Kandy (I think they're the best in Sri Lanka). We also explored the local shopping area, colonial buildings and stunning lookouts of Kandy city.  But the best was yet to come, Saman took us to a local restaurant where we had our best Sri Lankan meal of the trip. The black curry ckicken was amazing.  And to top it off, Saman dropped us off at Kandy station the next day and waited until we boarded, to make sure we on board and no one took our seats !  A truly memorable experience which deserves 6 stars, not 5 !","February 26, 2024",0.0,0.0

I’ve been to many Asian cities, and Kandy was by far the ugliest city. First it is a quite big, busy and noicy city. We got here by the train from Ella, and our hotel was in walking distance from the train station. The streets had garbage all over, and the city smelled bad. Also there was only bad quality shops there. No unique market items - just the same old elephant baggy trousers in every shop. So not much shopping here. Both Ella and Arugam Bay had much better shopping alternatives. We actually even got scammed by a person we Met in the street. He came over very enthusiastic saying Hello, and asking if we recognized him. He worked at our hotel but of course we didn’t recognize him without his uniform. Every other city in sri Lanka the people has been so friendly, that we didn’t think much about it. He asked if we wanted him to show us around, and we said sure. Suddenly we were in the market shop of his brother asking us to buy some Things to help his brothers shop going around. Felt obligated to buy an overpriced scarf. We also walked to the lake. To be honest it wasn’t that special - just an ordinary lake. Quite filthy and the rails were covered in plastic full of bird poop. Actually I would just recommend you to skip Kandy!

A friend recommended the food court on the 4th floor of the City Center building, so I went there and tried the Indian. First off the place has NO ambiance, it is literally a food court with no wait staff, etc. The problem was that I ordered mutton biryani (sp?) which was so fatty and tough the meat was inedible. An extremely small portion of salad was served on the side of the plate. This for the high price of 900 rupees. But the real kicker came when I paid the bill only to discover that my 2 small cans of coke also cost 900 rupees. When it was all over, my bill for a crappy dinner was 2211 rupees, and you can get much much better almost anywhere for a quarter of the price. This place is a little tricky, too, since the coke ""station"" just rang up my purchase on a card without telling me the price. Only when I went to leave was the card scanned into the cash register and the total ripp-off was revealed to me.  There are so many good places to eat in Kandy, I beg you to stay away from this awful food court. The mall in the building is nice, though, and worth a visit.","January 10, 2019",0.0,0.0

They have Kids Play Area and need to pay for entry and games. There is a proper washroom area. You can use for very reasonable price cheaper than dirty Kandy city other washrooms. And much cleaner. Unfortunately, they don't have good car porch which is essential to shopping mall. And you have to get wet if it is raining. And There is a Major issue of this shopping mall. They don't have any single seating facility to occupy one person inside the mall. Only small area of steps available near keells at ground floor. And always KCC security officers are yelling at people if they try to sit. But, busy time, people have to seat that poor seating facility. So, I think, they have to improve seating facilities to ensure the usage of their shopping mall. I am a regular customer of their mall and I visit daily for my consumer needs. So, I really unpleasant about their poor seating facilities. My most of needs fulfill by this mall shops and I think this feature must be improved.

The whole city centre is a downmarket place with local made stuff that includes slippers, bags, multi colored shorts and puffed rice. Please do not waste time and money behind the lovely name ‘Kandy’. There is a lake, yes, so? Nothing great about it. Food: below average eateries. Thankfully there is a funny empty mall with a food court and could something to eat there. What to buy: absolutely nothing at all. What to see: lake What to do: sleep by 7PM as the streets go empty by this time. Overall: a big NO Unless there is a religious attachment of buddhism. In that case, there is Buddha teeth relic to see for an extrance fee. Caution: do not go behind the typical google items like ‘top 10 things to do in Kandy’. Trust me there are no such things.

As are many in Asia, this one has a vertical orientation with several floors of all types of retail shops----upscale and not; with ubiquitous electronics stores there too. The Food Court is quite impressive for a mall, relatively speaking,  with various culinary genres present from Burger King to much finer venues. There is also a roller coaster up top albeit one with a very small footprint. The location is ideal---right in the middle of the city center across the street from the Kandy Lake and Temple of the Sacred Tooth.

They generally visit Kandy also, which is considered as the second capital of the country. KCC is clean and bright as the staff does maintenance round the clock. The toilets are clean too and attended to, at all times but have to pay a small sum of Rs 10 meant for the privet organization maintaining it. Staff are helpful and tourists have to inquire from security guards of the location of certain shops as its display not given which is a draw back. The Direct factory Outlet of Melbourne (DFO) displays orientation of each of outlets under different floors. The food Loft is on the top (4th Floor) which was opened in August 2016. It is called as “Dinning Loft”. It has an access road from the vehicle road bordering the lake and to the left of the KCC. Therefore the customers can easily reach the place conveniently. New type of innovation is introduced where an electronic card is given to the customer which is used for ordering food. The payment is made at the departure. The delicious food, sweets, beverages etc from around the world (Italian / Thai / Chinese / Indian) could be consumed in a pleasing surrounding  while enjoying the beauty of the Kandy lake and the mountainous surrounding. The modernized food court gives  a very nice experience for the customers. The variety of food offered is great too. The atmosphere is pleasing.  The food is reasonably priced. Ice-cream parlour provides a range of different tastes of them. KCC Offers good branded goods with choices to select from and the quality of the purchased is genuine. The staff is very friendly and helpful. A playing area and small roller coaster is in operation in the evenings. The fee charge for the roller coaster is on the higher side. I would briefly mention the main  allocations in different levels. They are; Level 1 : Banks , Level 2: Electronic items/ Jewellaery / Tea; Level 3: Fashion clothes, Level 4 :Food Court / World Play , and Level 5: Family Events (Handicrafts / Book Stalls/ Exhibitions) I’m sure you would remember the visit you made to KCC for a long time in your life.","February 23, 2017",0.0,0.0

There's four different cuisines - Indian, Thai, Chinese and Italian as well as sweets and beverages of course. You choose from the menu and then place you order at the respective ""restaurant"". Nice and simple and no cash needed until you leave (or card). This place opened in August 2016 and I must say it's by far he freshest restaurant (or Dining Loft as they call it) we've come across in Kandy.

The food court upstairs offers basic ""Chinese, Indian, Thai, pastries"" all looking woefully sad. So I walk over to the open terrace where the restaurant offers a fairly decent buffet lunch, a good bargain for 595/- rupees. Or so I think. Beware ITS A TRAP they force you to pay for bottled water by telling you they only have tap water. So I ask "" you don't offer filtered water?"" They say "" tap only Saar"".

We both love curries and when you taste a traditional curry and all the accompanying condiments, prepared by someone who knows how to balance the spice, your journey begins. Every town has a different story, and you need a guide/ driver to help you navigate. Our accommodation was out of the city centre, so we could relax at night out of the amazing chaos, then begin again each morning. Start your day early as the heat builds up. We walked around the botanical gardens during the hottest part of the day but at least there you have plentiful shade from the beautiful old trees. We also visited the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic. Our guide took us to watch the 1000's of pilgrims bring lunch offerings. Be prepared - there are long queues and then a crush to get close to the chamber housing the Tooth Relic, as it is of major significance for Buddhist pilgrims. Being part of it is something you won't experience anywhere else. Only locals can enter the chamber and tourists are very much in the minority. Car parks are huge! Take note of the spot where you park your car! Lesson learnt for us! We were laughing, as our guide was embarrassed at first, but then he laughed with us.

The ground floor is where you'll find a little supermarket which we used predominantly to top up our water supplies. The little cashew nut vendor outside the supermarket is pretty pricey, I guess...but I just couldn't get enough of the black pepper flavoured ones! The shops aren't anything particularly special but, having said that, between two of us we bought 2 pairs of trousers, 1 pair of shorts, 3 pairs of jandals, a necklace and 2 traditional sarongs. KCC also held a cultural display with dancers, crafts and food at no charge as part of Perahera one afternoon. The burger king upstairs has a curry and rice option and the vegetarian burger is awesome! All in all, KCC is a good place to just get out of the heat and hustle and bustle for a few hours.","September 1, 2015",0.0,0.0

As we only had one full day there we decided to take them up on their offer of a van for 5,000 for the day. We asked if the van was of a good standard and what type? Did it have AC. They told us it was a very good Nissan van and for AC we had to pay 6,000. So we agreed. The next day they arrived in a Nissan van which should of been retired in the 1980's. On arrival at the first attraction it failed to re-start when we were ready to drive to the next attraction. They left us stranded at the Buddha after the owner of the company came in his new Toyota to try and start the old van. To no avail of course. So they could then only offer us the Tut Tut's. Not ideal but we agreed as what else could we do! I requested a price of 4,000 and they agreed. We were then stuck waiting for 45 minutes for the Tut Tut's to arrive. Two of our group wanted to buy certain items but they kept taking us to stores they did not want to visit. The large depressing tourist meccas where busloads are herded in and they get a nice commission. They were all totally unsuitable and a waste of our time. We had already wasted one hour when the old van broke down. By 2 pm we had had enough and asked to go back to our hotel. Then they wanted more money than agreed. One of our group paid them 5,000 just to get them out of our lives! They were to come back at 6 pm but they no showed or may of been late. We did not wait around.

Frankly, from what we have seen, quality of the sites, costs and associated discomfort do not justify the trips at all. In a case you are adamant about making the trips, rent a place somewhere north of Kandy, closer to the sites. Kandy City by itself is nothing special if you compare it to an average town in Malaysia  and definitely much less interesting or charming than Hanoi or southern India.

Just remember it's very easy to say we'll walk it but, in 45c heat and the same in humidity I don't think so..!   The city of Kandy has much to offer including the much vaunted Temple, lake, shopping centre, markets, military cemeteries, restaurants, museums, as well as the surrounding hills complete with panoramic views.  The Mall as expected is full of the usual high end shops which one avoids on holiday unless your absolutely bored rigid  and feeling homesick of course. The main attractions though, do speak for themselves like the Temple, lake etc. And are well worth the stay here alone, as for the restaurants well, let's just say it's a curry lovers paradise and there are many other eateries on hand to suit everyone including the sad ones who can't see past Burger King on holiday...! We did walk and Tuk Tuked around here over 4 days, criss crossing this busy city and never had any bother at all however, one night outside the Temple we were approached by a seedy looking character who asked us if we wanted something ""Special"" ?  Catching on right away I chased him with a few choice words in his ears, as getting caught with dodgy substances could easily result in spending the rest of your holiday in a tiny Sri Lankan cell with 30 other guys who want to be your ""Friend"" and isn't the best way of seeing a prison attraction in Kandy especially the showers...So be warned..! As for the shopping I would suggest going to the main market for any trinkets, and don't forget to haggle for everything, the only down side to visiting this Temple is the high price they also charge for us ""Foreigners"" to enter which should be free in my opinion. But, this is Sri Lanka and the Govt, run attractions see us as cash cows which is a great shame here and spoils the moment. Just keep an open mind and you'll enjoy this unique relatively friendly city and sadly, as is the way of the World these days, I would advise any lone females to be on the side of caution and keep their wits about them especially at night as it doesn't take much to be complacent in a strange city ...Stay safe and Enjoy..!","October 14, 2014",0.0,0.0

The city is located in between multiple mountain ranges including the Knuckles mountain range and the Hanthana Mountain Range, giving the city an elevation of 500 metres (1,600 ft) above sea level. With Kandy located in the centre of the island and in a high elevation, the city has a relatively wetter and cooler temperatures than that of the tropical climate of the rest of the country, especially the coastal regions. Nuwara Eliya is south to it and has a cooler climate due to its higher elevation. Main attraction is Kandyan dance takes its name from Kandy, this genre is today considered the classical dance of Sri Lanka. The three classical dance forms differ in their styles of body-movements and gestures, in the costumes worn by the performers, and in the shape and size of the drums used to provide rhythmic sound patterns to accompany the dancing. The drum used in Kandyan dancing is known as the Geta Bera, the drum in Ruhunu (low country) dancing as the ""Yak Bera"", and drum in Sabaragamu dancing as the ""Davula"" (the word Bera or Bereya in Sinhale means ""Drum"") The Geta Bera is beaten with the hands as is also Yak Bera, while the Davula is played with a stick on one side and with one hand on the other side; the Geta Bera has a body which tapers on both sides while the Yak Bera and the Davula both have cylindrical bodies. The main distinguishing feature between Kandyan and Sabaragamu dancing, and Ruhunu dancing, is that Ruhunu dancers wear masks.","July 3, 2014",0.0,0.0

It is near the lake. We went twice one in the afternoon and the other  in the evening as the shrine was opened in the evening only. We had come to know of it only on visiting the temple. Lake is huge  a good one. Boating is available. Kandly cultural dance is near the temple. the show starts in the evening 6 pm . It takes places in the cultural academy andin  red cross society , adjacent to each other. You can go into any one of them. There is an entrance ticket for the show. It is for an hour. The end part is fire walking similar to the traditions in south India. Peradinya  Garden is good and can be covered in half day. A good walking. There are wood carving factories and Gem stones factories around kandy. You can opt to visit. From Colombo it takes approx. one and half hours. On the way we went to Pinnawale elephant orphanage. All foreigners have to buy entrance tickets. For SAARC countries there are concessions available. During our visit time, the elephants were in the river. WE had enjoyed thoroughly. We gave bananas. The mahouts takes money from the visitors  for feeding bananas. The elephants on its own come to you to get the bananas. There are some people who feed at that time. Worth to visit.
