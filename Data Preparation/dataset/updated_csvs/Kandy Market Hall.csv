Specifically, we made some purchases in store No. 42 (Marzook), where a very kind young man treated us exquisitely, always with a smile, and explained to us the characteristics and properties of the products he offered in his store. After some haggling, we ended up purchasing some spices and cosmetic products, and as we were leaving he even offered us a small gift.

The vast majority of shops will have fake prices shown to take advantage of the tourists who visit. However we managed to find one shop who the owner was so genuine and offered us local prices from the offset. They all state they are offering local prices, but when your paying 50 rupees for a tube of cumin and 55 rupees for chilli powder, then you know it's much closer to local prices (Vs other shops selling for 150-200 per tube).

UK or elsewhere, they are usually worth the time to take a look. This is the second Sri Lankan one we've been to, the previous one in Negombo, and the sights, smells, and sounds are an assault on the senses. You'll hardly be able to pass a single stall without an invitation to buy. It doesn't matter that you don't want spices, or that the carved wooden elephant would put you over the airline weight limit, the vendors will be on the attack! It's mostly friendly banter: ""Where you from?"" ""We can do you a great price!"" ""Lovely leather bag, sir?"" and a firm ""No, thank you."" is usually sufficient. They are often VERY persuasive though, so be aware. We found a great upstairs outlet selling local fabric. I bartered my way to a great deal on material to make into a bed throw and cushion covers, but my wife had spotted a gorgeous blue and gold sari that she needed for a wedding later in the year, so that was that! My mission then was to get a couple of wall hangings thrown in, which was managed (if you don't ask, you don't get..!) and we left the outlet some 8000 rupees lighter. [This equates to around £40, and is a fraction of cost in Europe!] Immersing in the local experience is a great way of finding souvenirs and providing you keep your wits about you, you can spend as much and as little as you want.

I walked into the unassuming shop, no. 201 and 202 and  felt I was I hit the jackpot.

Put on a smile, a positive attitude and get ready to experience some new fruits and spices. I bought some spices and tea at the market as well as a sarong (for wearing in the tooth temple). The sellers are a lot less aggressive than in other countries I have visited, which gave me a much better impression of the market. It is also a square garden in the middle making it feel less crowded. The second floor is mainly clothes/leathers/textiles, while the first floor is fruits/vegetables. To be honest, there was a lot of crap in the second floor such as fake t-shirts, however I suppose there is not a market in the world without these things... They also had some good fabrics, and the sellers seemed completely honest with regards to the qualities: They admitted what was woven/printed, silk vs polyester (I am not an expert though...).","April 1, 2015",0.0,0.0

The market is a hall like structure  surrounding an open, courtyard and cultivated garden where much of the produce is washed before being displayed. The smell of spices waft from the various stalls on the ground level, where you will also find an abundance of fresh fruit, herbs, vegetables, flowers, incense, utencils, fish and packaged foods. You will be amazed by the beauty, presentation and quality of the products on offer. The Sri Lankan diet is mainly vegetarian and very healthy. Food choices are often based on the medicinal properties from many of the plants, roots and herbs. Generally many Sri Lankan people would prefer natural remedies for various ailments. Ascend the stairs to the top level for local arts, batiks, crafts, linens, fashions, souvenirs ornaments and decorations. There are many treasures to be found. The total market area is large when you include the entrances, alcoves and exits which are sheltered under  natural canopies  to keep the sun out. These areas constitute the hub and have the buzz factor as people trip over each other for the best deals. You could easily spend a couple of hours enjoying the different sections of this market. Have yourself a fresh King Coconut drink and eat the inner flesh for a special treat. Dip into some fresh cashews and try some exotic fruits you will be delighted by the different flavours, smells and textures. If you are on tour, your guide will gladly take you upon request. Alternatively, catch a tuk tuk, local bus or taxi of which there are many. If central the cost to get there is low. Enjoy Lulu and Diddis market experience. There are also many other photos of Sri Lanka from the ruins to Ella Gap and Colombo. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vW1OCzaBso","March 23, 2015",0.0,0.0

The upper floor has the usual selection of clothing stalls, but the prices are very much higher than, for example, Thailand or Indonesia for the same items - perhaps 3 times the price.

This market is actually housed in a square building sort of open planned and is on two levels housing just about everything including clothes, fruit, wooden ornaments, trinkets, oils, spices, etc, the only downside is they tend to sell the identical stuff and of course the clothes, bags etc are also copies but, good ones I might add but, just be careful though. Walking around I was acutely aware of an old guy following us, and of course he just happened to be a ""Friend""  who would help us avoid the ""Bad shops"" naturally,  and trying to keep a straight face I kind of agreed. It turned out he was related to half the shop owners we visited and he was trying to get as much sales as he could for us, to be honest he was harmless and unfortunately for him he was dealing with a ""Battle Hardened "" World traveller who's visited markets a lot worse than this.  However we did buy some spices along with a huge bunch of bananas which I fed to the visiting monkeys back at my hotel, also do try the red bananas,as they're quite sweet as well as the grapes. Just walking around there is no snarling, shouting ""In your face"" sales pitch routine as you'd expect, and it's pretty relaxed too and do remember to haggle for everything, we also found the fish & meat side very interesting too, as well as watching the local cats & dogs sitting patiently awaiting the scraps.  Moving upstairs is more in the way of local crafts and clothes and this is where I got some of my fridge magnets as they were so cheap and the shopkeeper even dropped the price on these, I also tried to get a huge wooden elephant at another shop but, couldn't agree the price even with my ""Friends"" help, this guy was just being greedy and of course we had the old tourist mug sign above us. I do have to admit it was interesting watching what the locals were buying and one must wonder what their curries tasted like.? As for us we left pretty relaxed here considering in the past visiting some markets in the Middle East & Africa you feel like you've been 10 rounds with Mike Tyson and all for a ceramic vase or something stupid.!  A good tip here for anyone who's a bit nervous in these places, is to keep eye contact at all times when haggling, be prepared to walk away. And if you wear a pair of mirrored sunglasses it spooks them no end, as all they can see is there own face looking back it works every time. There is also a market across the road which is below the street  and we avoided this one like the plague, as it looked really third World and dirty..!","October 7, 2014",0.0,0.0
