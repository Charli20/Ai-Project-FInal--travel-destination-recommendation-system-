There lay a surprising place and torrential rain. This Buddhist temple is considered the most magnificent architectural building created during the Gampola era, dating back to the 14th century. The temple should be from the mid-1300s and Tamil (indu) workers work there. The temple is built on a black rock (Panhalgala), where the ancient access staircase is carved, and resembles a real villa. The ""house of the image"" encloses the Buddha and has ceiling decorations of rare delicacy and beauty. But the visit does not end there: entering the ""villa"" you discover another internal building, with a mystical and mysterious atmosphere, dedicated to Hindu deities. On the outside, a long inscription in Sinhalese and Tamil is carved into the rock.","December 7, 2024",0.0,0.0

It is located on the summit of a large granite rock, called Panhalgala. You enter via the Main Street in the village, through a large roofed gate (entrance fee Rs300). The setting is as impressive as the temple and because it is out of the way there are very few tourists. If you make your way around to the far side (east) of the large white temple/image house, with sculptured elephants and other designs, you get to the entrance of the shrine. Inside is a large seated Buddha, with two huge ivory tusks either side. Make sure you look up as well to see the decorative paintings & designs, in particular the hansa puttuwa (conjoined swans), which apparently is the best presentation of its kind. Back around the western side of the temple, is the makara thorana (dragon arch) and the entrance to the Hindu shrine. If you can get the caretaker to unlock the doors, it is worth it. The vaulted brick Hindu shrine to Lord Vishnu, is wrapped around the outside of the Buddhist shrine, all in the one building. This is what makes it unique.

But after several minutes we were tired to argue and went with him. He opened the curtain with God, so I could not imagine, that there was a door... We saw another older temple Inside. It was unexpected and hence very catchy. The only thing that spoiled the impression was another ""donation guy"", who wanted us to pay the entrance ticket, but unlike in other temples he didnt have any tickets... So we refused saying, that we already payed the donation to the first guy (which was the truth). But at least the first guy earned it. The place is very beautiful from outside also...

It is built on the summit of a rock called Panhalgala and provides a magnificent panoramic view of the surrounding hills, paddy fields and the diverse vegetation around it. The building was originally four storeyed but today there is only the ground floor and a part of the first floor. The temple is built of brick and granite on an uneven rock surface with a cruciform ground plan. The architecture is a combination of the Polonnaruwa period with Indian influence. A flight of stairs cut into the rock surface of the premises leads to the main entrance of the temple. On both sides of the entrance are gajasimhas (Elephant-lion) sculptures. There is an arched passage decorated with carved Gandharva and Gaja-Lakshmi. In one of the niches there is a huge statue of Ganesha, while in another there is a statue of Vishnu, reflecting the Hindu influence. The deity Skanda can be found to the north of entrance. The passage leads to a pavilion and through it to an inner chamber. The 24 Buddhas that preceded Gautama Buddha are exquisitely painted on the walls and ceiling. In a chamber is a colossal statue of seated Buddha under a beautiful dragon arch. Near the temple are rock inscriptions in Sinhala and Tamil detailing the temple facilities and the gifts bestowed by the kings. The shoes have to be removed and kept at a place some distance away from the temple. When I visited the sun was blazing and the ground was very hot making it very painful to walk barefoot to the temple. The caretaker permits only one group at a time inside the temple.
