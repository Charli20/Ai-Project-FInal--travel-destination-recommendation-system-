We were there in the off-season. There was virtually nothing open on the path and even they were not welcoming. There was a lot of construction, repairs along the route. People were hard at work. A little tragic were the people who carried the goods and building materials up the 5,000 stairs on their heads. At times great views. An absolute challenge! Once on top, nothing.  Wire mesh fence. In low season, the Sri Pada is also not accessible. And then it goes down again. 5500 uneven steps and stairs with shaking legs. I did it - because my friend wanted it so badly - and she turned halfway around. I wanted to know why everyone wants to go up there. There's no reason. Sorry! The area is beautiful! Look at them! But Adams Peak - unless you're a pilgrim or an extreme athlete - wasn't worth it to me.","December 7, 2025",0.0,0.0

We had proper footwear and layers in case of cold. The whole experience was underwhelming : huge amount of commercial outlets all the way up , hordes of pilgrims and we were unable to get to the summit as there was a 2 - 3 hour wait to get up the last 200m and we would have missed the sunrise. Our guide took us on some short cuts over fairly treacherous terrain to avoid the crowds. The climb is fairly exhausting with 5500 uneven steps in depth and height even though we were relatively fit 65 year olds. There was a lot of litter everywhere. I don’t it’s worth the hassle.

From the sporting side, the more than 5000 steps from Dalhousie are easy to climb for fit in 2 hours.  In fact, the sunrise is very atmospheric, so set off about 2:30 or 3:00. There is little space on top and a cold wind whistles, so take change clothes and jacket as well as headgear! The descent is a little faster with about 1 1⁄2 hours. But it depends very much on the amount of pilgrims. Around the full moon the traffic jam is guaranteed and then it can take a sensitive longer time, they say.

Standing at 2,243 meters (7,359 feet) above sea level, it is a popular pilgrimage destination for people of all faiths. The most notable feature of Adam's Peak is the Sri Pada, a large, hollow rock formation on the summit that resembles a human footprint. According to legend, this footprint is that of Adam, the first man, or Lord Buddha, or even Lord Shiva. There are four main routes to the summit of Adam's Peak: the Hatton Route, the Nilamale Route, the Maskeliya Route, and the Palabathini Route. The Hatton Route is the most popular, as it is the shortest and most well-equipped. The climb to Adam's Peak is challenging but rewarding. The trails are steep and often slippery, and the altitude can make it difficult to breathe. However, the views from the summit are breathtaking, and the sense of accomplishment is immense. In addition to the religious significance of Adam's Peak, it is also a beautiful natural wonder. The mountain is surrounded by lush green forests and rolling hills, and the views from the summit are stunning. If you are planning to visit Sri Lanka, I highly recommend climbing Adam's Peak.

Absolutely none of the chaos or bad weather described on here - which isn’t to say those reviews aren’t accurate; just that we were seemingly very lucky. Climbing on the 2nd Nov, a good month before the pilgrimage season really starts, it was like a ghost path. The perfect time to do it if you want to avoid the crowds (which, reading the reviews, sound like hell on earth). Ok, no food&drinks stalls open, but we had water and a few snacks and the lone monk at the summit made us tea. Most importantly, however, we got lucky with the weather. So that would be our tip: climb in the off-season - and pray to Buddha, Shiva, Allah, God or whatever other mountain deity for good weather.","November 2, 2024",0.0,0.0

Day timer Leave earliest -7AM the best .There's a time zone between 6am to around 11 am when the cloud ceiling stay way up and above the sky so the scenary and photography would be ideal during the time frame. 7AM start means you can be at the summit by 11am without the need to make it a physical exercise. This is just before the ceiling starts to descend. Better to begin return from the summit by around 12 to be safely back to Nallathanni by 3pm. This could be before the skies open up for afternoon rain. Take water- 2 lilters. Best not to buy water from the shops as we too would be aiding the plastic pollution by supporting the very source of that problem- the sale of PET bottles along the route. Nighter.. Ideal time to leave Nallathanni would be 12pm, giving you sufficient head way to reach the summit by 4am. The gallery where the much famed sunrise could be viewed AND photographed[ photography is not allowed at the upper tier] is quite small and has room for not more than 100. This place is packed to capacity by 5am. So better not be too smart at starting late. The payment of course is one might need to bear the chill at dawn which could easily be in single digits. But to secure a decent vantage point on that little gallery you need to be seated there by 4am the least. Payback for the pains of the biting cold added by 10kmph winds could be that 45 minute absolute fascination of the sunrise - the finest on earth, so they say. Make sure to move away from the gallery just after the sun reveals itself in full.

I have a good level of fitness, a 39 year old gym goer 3-5 times a week so when I say this is easy please bear this in mind. My heart rate stayed pretty steady throughout (120) with a slight increase on the steeper spots. Some tips from me; 1. DIFFICULTY:  I'm not silly enough to think this would not be tough for some people and I definitely saw people struggling but if you go slow you will be fine. The first half is pretty wide steps, quite a nice walk and then yes lots of steep steps. 2. DURATION:  We went at a pretty slow pace, left at 02:30 and was at the summit for 05:00, we stopped off a few times for 5-10 mins and it felt like a nice walk. (remember to add any walking time from the hotel on to this time) it took us about 2 hours to get back down. So with stopping at the top (1hr) we did it in 6 hours. Again remember we did this relatively slow, you could do it faster if you wished 🙂 3. COLD: It is cold at the top, I'm an English girl I had shorts on but did have to put a hoodie on, if I stayed any longer than the 10-15 mins I was up there I would have needed to layer up more 4. SLEEP BEFORE: There were so many people sleeping on stairs on the way down, clearly they had stayed up the night before, this could be due to the challenge they set themselves for their pilgrimage but if you don't have stay awake don't! We went to sleep at 20:00 The night before waking up at 01:00 and we felt very fresh 5. WATER: Drink a litre before you go it will help with your breathing loads, I drank approx 2 litres from a water bladder whilst walking. I saw so many people struggling with water bottles whilst walking - if you can take a  bladder do! 5. ATTIRE: Until about the last 30 mins I had some gym shorts and a crop top, I wore hiking shoes too (God send), towards the end it was cold and I wore a hoodies as mentioned above. I have dicky knees so wore knee straps the entire duration and didn't get any serious pain throughout. 6. WHEN TO GO: We went on the 9 April just before the children broke up for the new year which was also a weekday it was absolutely fine, no real problems. I have heard there are lots of crowds weekends and holidays! 7: THE SUMMIT: If you are religious great I think you will like the top, for me I'll be honest, I wasn't going to stay for more than 10 mins, photos are prohibited and it was rapidly building up with people. Just you reach the summit you will need to remove your shoes, I have heard they can go missing so we put ours in our bag. I was also asked asked to cover shoulders/knees to enter the shrine that is there. I couldn't see where I could have taken a photo when sunrise did come so we rang the bell and quickly started to descend before sunrise. 8: SUNRISE: We walked down a flight or two of stairs and sheltered in a cafe until sunrise (the cafe was the first one we came too on our descent down) we bought a couple of bars of chocolate and they let us sit in their tent which had windows so we could see when the sun started to rise. When the sun started to come up we started to walk down the stairs and there were many places we could stop on the way to take photos. I have no idea why anyone would freeze at the top (unless for religious reasons) when there didn't appear to even be a viewing platform to see the sunrise. 9. MONEY: Food and drink is cheap. Although we had nothing other than packaged or bottled due to being warned away as food is cooked in river water. A bottle of coke was a £1 a chocolate bar 80p. HAVE TO PAY FOR TOILETS Rs50 (about 13p) so don't forget to take some small notes 🙂 In summary yes it could be tough if fitness level is low, take your time, avoid peak times but enjoy! Lots to see especially on the way down, stunning views and a real accomplishment! ❤️","April 9, 2024",0.0,0.0

We started after 7am and returned before midday. What we learned: 1. Avoid weekends and full moons, the traffic levels are insane. 2. We heard many stories of sunrises being so crowded that people reached a standstill traffic jam, waited 1-2 hours, barely/never moving, before turning around and leaving. For people who did reach the top or close to it, fog/clouds often impacted seeing the sun rise. 3. It is a very tough hike with the last part of it being constant uphill stairs. Go at your own pace, take breaks when needed, drink plenty of water and an energy drink/coke or two. 4. There is no nice viewing platform at the top, it is a temple. Similarly unlike most hikes there are no nice quiet places to have a rest at. The stops that do exist are often filthy and full of rubbish and already occupied. 5. There are plenty of drink/food/snack vendors along the majority of the route, including some where you can have a sit down meal. Cold drinks are not always available, note if the fridge is actually on. 6. There are toilets available, you’ll often have to pay though it’s not much. 7. There is a swimming spot near the bend in the trail at Seetha Gangula Crossing (not the water you can hear falling right at the bend, but further south on the opposite side of the path to the public latrine complex). Treat yourself, relax your legs, swim with the locals. 8. There's an alternate (and far more friendly) route from Pine’s needle. It is not as crowded and is more of a slope as opposed to constant stairs. 9. Be prepared for the usual staring and whispering as you walk past locals, some will also find it amusing if you're a big sweater like me and throw out the occasional jibe. 10.

In different sources you can find various names for this object: Sri Pada, Samanalakanda, Sivanolipatha Malai, Adam’s Peak, Butterfly Mountain, Sumanakuta, Ratnagiri, Sivanolipaatamalai, Śrī Pāda, Adam’s Peak etc. But all this is a mountain with a height of 2243 meters, which is located in a mountainous area in the south-southwestern part of the island in the province of Sabaragamuwa. To the capital - Colombo - nothing at all, some 65 miles. Strange as it may sound, four religions at once consider Sri Pada a sacred mountain. And why? Yes, because at its very top, in front of the temple erected there, on a bare granite (or some kind of stone?) platform, we can clearly distinguish a gigantic depressed “footprint”, well, very similar to the imprint of a human foot. And each of the world’s largest religions “interprets” this very trace in its own way. Christians (which was news to me!!!) claim that this is the trace of the Apostle Thomas: that the latter preached in India and on the Island is mentioned by Gregory the Theologian, Ambrose of Milan, Jerome of Stridon, Peacock of Nolan, etc. Representatives of Buddhism are firm in their belief that this “footprint” was left by none other than Gautama Buddha himself, who touched the ground here with his foot while visiting the island. In Hinduism, Sri Pada and the mentioned “trace” are associated with the god Vishnu (the latter, according to representatives of this religion, is a human transformation (avatar) in the image of Buddha). Well, in Islam, the same “footprint” is considered the imprint of the foot of Adam, who at one time was cast from heaven to earth on the island of Serendib (the ancient Arabic name of Sri Lanka), right at the top of Adam’s Peak. It was around this sacred must see, which made the mountain itself sacred, that at one time they clouded the aura of divinity and, as a result, the pilgrimage of everyone and everything. They say that if you climb the five thousand two hundred steps to the top of Sri Pad, it will have a beneficial effect on the purification of your soul. Atheists, on the other hand, believe that by climbing the mountain, you can enjoy the amazing views that open from its top. In general, everyone climbs/steps up Adam’s Peak “for their own.” Why did I decide to go up there? To be honest, I don’t know myself. Just for the record, apparently - I’m a naked city tourist and I’m not very interested in the views of virgin nature, green grass, rivers, waterfalls, stones, rocks, cliffs, etc. Nevertheless, I decided... Having read the reviews of fellow tourists, I dressed warmly enough. I didn’t splurge on mountain shoes - my “combat” waterproof trekking shoes “Quechua Waterproof”, bought from Decathlon during a trip to Normandy in 2019, did an excellent job. The only thing is that I took with me a spare T-shirt (I really got sweaty during the trip) and thick socks (I read that at the very top, vigilant security forces pilgrims to take off their shoes and hang out “barefoot” (but this only applies to the area where the stupa with Buddha is). I started at the beginning of five - I read that the climb takes two and a half to three hours, and somehow I was not in the mood to meet the sunrise at the top. I made an “adjustment” for my age and shape, which was far from youthful athletic, so I didn’t walk very quickly. As the altitude grew, it became increasingly cloudy; along the way, I met several cute monkeys hanging out in the thickets along the trail. There were surprisingly few pilgrims - it seemed like I climbed the mountain during the season, then the crowds described in the posts of travel lovers were not observed (or was I just lucky?). Halfway to the top of Sri Pada, you, like me, can admire the Peace Pagoda (Peace Pagoda or Shanti Stupa), built, according to Internet sources, on the initiative of the Nichiren Buddhist order, including both monks and lay people - Nipponzan Myohoji ""(Nipponzan Myōhōji) - in 1978. I reached the top in three hours (with a tiny “tail”), hung out, took pictures of the neighboring peaks, “covered” by clouds. The journey back took about the same time. There is a lot of talk on the net about a saying attributed to the aborigines about climbing Adam's Peak (I won't quote it - it's already blurry), but I probably agree with its second part - about climbing Sri Pada again. Some kind of holiness, a feeling of purification of the soul, divinity, etc. I didn't feel it. And I was very skeptical about the “trace” of Adam/Buddha/Vishnu/Thomas: the fact is that this place has been known as sacred since the 4th century AD: it is mentioned in the Dipavamsa (the earliest Pali chronicle), in the Mahavamsa chronicle ( V century), in the chronicle of Rajavalia (the date of writing is not established), in the notes of the famous Chinese pilgrim and traveler Fa Hien. But for some reason there is no mention of the “trace”. But the famous dromomaniac comrade Marco Polo, talking about his travel to the Island in 1298, mentioned Adam’s Peak as an important place of pilgrimage - and not a word about the “trace”!!! Similarly, in the notes of the Arab traveler Abu Abdullah Muhammad ibn Battuta from 1344: having climbed to the top of Sri Pad, he mentioned the stairs and iron racks with chains that helped pilgrims climb. And, again, not a single mention for the “footprint”... And only in the travel notes of John Davy, a Cornish doctor and amateur chemist who visited the top of Adam’s Peak in 1817, do we find a mention for the “huge footprint”. I do not deny the existence of gods, but I also do not take the side of any religion or faith, and I am also very skeptical about phenomena and events that are presented as miracles. ""Was there a boy?"" – probably only the Earth itself knows about this... By the way, my dear reader, I didn’t know that there are TWO Adam’s Peaks on the Island!!! I wrote about the Big one above, but Little Adam’s Peak, with a height of only 1151 meters, is located near the city of Ella. It takes just over half an hour to climb it, as those in the know say, and the views from its top at sunset are especially interesting. I haven’t been there myself, but just in case I added it to my travel tablets - maybe someday I’ll end up in Ceylon again...","March 18, 2024",0.0,0.0

The crowds were at a minimum so we didn’t need to queue anywhere and could pass slower walkers easily. When we got to the top it was blowing a hoolie. We ascended so quickly that we would have needed to wait about 2.5 hours for sunrise. Because of the heavy rain, we decided to reach peak and turn around. At the top, no photos allowed, or headwear or shoes, so off came our soaking wet walking boots so we could pay our respects at the temple and see the Buddha’s golden foot. We rang the bell once (for the number of times you climbed it) and then turned to get down. It felt very tricky the first couple of kms from the top as the steps are very steep and you need to overtake a lot of weary pilgrims. Fair play - most of them were either barefoot or in Flipflops! Everyone was friendly enough too. Despite no sunrise experience I would definitely do this again - fitness really helps you to enjoy the experience. If you are a seasoned hiker like us - we made it up in 1:45 hours  with no stops at all, so factor this in for sunrise. We used about 1.5L of water each but you might need more if not raining.

The dancers could have strolled up in the usual time, but waited for my wife and I taking six hours to ascend the Hatton path and two to descend. We needed breaks at many of the benches, a couple of which are under cover. Only the police station at the start was open and this was the only problem. A staffer claimed locals are banned out of season due to vandalism and demanded ID in return for relenting when we explained my wife has UK residence and needs her brothers as guides. There were only a dozen or so of us on the mountain, mostly young backpacker couples from Germany. The first parade of shops at the start were open, in fact are open 24h for the sunrise seekers, and a couple more further along the first third of the route, so there was some opportunity to revisit required water estimates. There is litter and rubble in many spots to the side of the stairway but the stairs were clear with handrails or walls. There were some toilet blocks we didn't try, and showers at two sites near the start we saw working. There were side steps at a couple of spots lower down to the river where locals bathe, where you can scoop some cold water on your face. We came across builders finishing a new toilet block about half way up, which looked to be quite modern. A couple of waypoint signs had fallen off, which count down the stages by numbers of steps accumulated. At the top we met the caretaker who helped us with the brew we took up. Cloud came and went during the trek so views are a lottery. We knew the temple wouldn't be open, but locals can still worship outside and you can peer over the gates to see the temple. We sat on the top steps before the temple steps proper and there was no wind. Those of us in just a base layer were fine without needing extra layers even when stopping in a breeze along the way and when sitting at the top with no wind. So save the weight and avoid coats if you're not going in peak season or planning on waiting for sunrise; a waterproof will be windproof and trap warm air. A few showers threatened to force us to dig out the waterproofs, but locals know the clouds soon pass so you can usually ignore them and stay breathable instead. I managed without a hat due to cloud cover. The choice of trainers rather than flipflops like locals paid off as it gets wet and one leach jumped on one of us. As a couple, we were left with sore knees and feet respectively and my pulse had not recovered an hour after descent, and, as warned, leg muscles refused to allow gainly walking the next day. Apparently I probably got dehydrated without realising it, which is why I had to will myself up the last few steps: drink your water all the way up, don't save it for an emergency, the ascent IS an emergency. The customary stray dogs guided us up, and, after leaving us behind to perhaps adopt a faster couple, on returning and finding us they jumped and howled with excitement. They are in poor condition so you don't want them cuddling up when you're eating. We say wild monkeys arguing in the trees, bigger than the tourist monkeys you see at most attractions. You'll also hear frogs and see a few birds you could try to identify.","July 28, 2023",0.0,0.0

It's the shortest (around 10 kms return) and the one with the best facilities but has a steep ascent with 5500 steps. The steps are made of concrete and there are guard rails all the way hence its one of the safest trails in the country, but it will still do a number on your knees.  [ A doctor friend advised us to wear knee guards from the beginning. Sadly we took the advice only after we returned from the trip.] This is a religious place and there is a season to travel, staring from December full moon poya day and ending on May full moon poya day. During the season the path is well lit (a torch would still be useful in the night though) and there are plenty of shops with food (instant noodles, roti, snacks etc), drinks (even energy drinks) & first aid along the trail. There are washrooms along the way. We used one maintained by the last shop in the trail ( you have to pay), which was extremely basic (covered in rucksack with the squatting pan fixed to the dirt floor) but it was surprisingly very clean. The same may not apply for other washrooms along the trail. You can travel off season but the lights will be turned off (a problem if you are climbing in the night) and the shops along the trail will be closed. Plus the weather is prone to rain which will turn the stairs into waterfalls. But if you travel during the season, you have to be mindful of the crowds which will lead to long queues. It is quite a popular option to climb during the night to reach the summit by early morning to wait for the sunrise. We took this option and went on a weekday (Thursday, 2nd of February) but it was school holidays and the Friday was a half day holiday. We started at 10.30 pm. It was slow going from the beginning. (But this was probably kind on our knees.) 3/4 of the way (around 3 pm) we heard from those returning that the summit was already packed and you will not be allowed to stay there till sunrise. So we made the mistake of taking a break for about 45 minutes since we didn't want to experience the summit in the dark. Once we resumed the climb we ended up in a long queue and it was 9 am when we reached the summit!!! The summit was also closed from 6 - 7 am for religious activities which made the queue even longer. (But foreigners were allowed to skip the queue and reach the view point in the summit since the queue was actually for the place of worship which was at a higher platform in the summit). Return journey took about 6 hrs. Partly due to crowds (but there was no queue), our knees and since we took long breakfast and lunch breaks on the trail. What to wear: The weather in the night was 16c but we were sweating profusely due to the climb. When we reached the entrance to the summit around 8.30 am it was around 11c and quite windy . It is also a religious place hence semi - covered gym/ hiking wear would be an ideal option. If you are planning to reach the summit early morning (around 5 am) for the sunrise it is better to carry some worm clothing and some head covering for the morning dew. What to take: During the season almost all what you need will be sold in the shops on the trail. But we found that our muscle pain relief balms, saline mixes and glucose quite useful ;) A torch is useful in the night and a hiking stick would help with knees.","February 7, 2023",0.0,0.0

Recommend either bringing a pole or locating a walking stick prior to your endeavor.  There are an amazing number of stalls up to the top that provide water, snacks --- you will be dumbfounded by the number of stalls that all sell the exact same thing right next to each other.  There are a few toilet stops along the way as well --- we didn't use them, so I can't attest to their status.  We started at 2a and got to ""The Last Tea Stop"" around 5:15a; had a coffee and then proceeded the final leg to the top. After finishing this experience, I would offer a few suggestions: -- bring a little flashlight so you can more easily see the steps; even though there is lighting along the path, it is not full-coverage. --instead of heading directly to the top to view the sunrise, pick a seat on a step t that is near but not AT the top.  The top is silly-crowded and the sunrise is still only in the east; ie. the sunrise isn't enhanced with a 360-degree view (that you most likely won't get anyway with the crowds). --  after sunrise, head up to the top.  Stay to respectfully observe the offering --- a ceremony that takes ~30 minutes.  The line to view the Sacred Foot is, well, long.  And you won't actually see what is considered the footprint -- it is covered with magnificent gold fabric.  It is a very sacred visit for the locals who drop some currency into the dish and then bow/kneel with a few seconds of prayer.  We (Americans) clearly didn't fit in with the crowd, especially as we only wanted to view the object.  It's 50/50 if I would recommend taking this time. -- don't forget that walking stick: you might be amazed at how something so seemingly inconsequential takes the stress off your knees/legs. -- if you aren't a stretching person, try to change just for this one time else your legs will most likely remind you of the hike for the following 4 days in most unpleasant ways. I think we could have avoided the muscle pain if we had simply taken a little time to stretch our legs after the hike. This was a great hike and if I were ever to find myself here again, I would do the hike again.  I noticed another review that commented to the trash along the path --- yes, that was surprising and disappointing.  Yet for me that was just a side-disappointment; it wasn't something that took away from the experience. ENJOY!!                  (and stretch! :-)","April 2, 2022",0.0,0.0

We had quite high expectations since many travelers posted great pictures and feedback about the climb. Now our personal experience was the following, we woke up at 2am to try to summit by 6am at the latest. The trip began with a short walk in the village of dalhousie until we finally reached the beginning of the path (Hatton path). The amount of trash there was just insane, it really looks like a junkyard, people are irrespectful of the nature. We didn't bring any water/food since we were told that everything was available for purchase there (which is true) however the level of hygiene in these shacks is really questionable. Many locals climbed at the same time than us and while most of them just stare at you, some of the people there were quite scary, my wife fell particularly unsafe when some guys (a group of 10/12 young adults) were circling us, staring at her and yelling at us (we failed to decipher what they said but I doubt that it was any friendly). Now when you finally reach the summit (after waiting in a queue that can last after 1 or 2 hours), the crowd prevents from seeing anything, unless you spend the night there camping like some of the locals. Even though, the weather is quite misty there so you're unlikely to see this breathtaking view that is advertised everywhere. That being said, sport-wise it is a good challenge, it is very hard to make it to the top (some people will tell you that 80 years old people make it, it is true however they climb in 8/10 hours, not 2/3 like you will) Also worth mentioning that we've met fantastic people everywhere else in Sri Lanka and never felt unsafe anywhere else.","March 10, 2022",0.0,0.0

Things to bear in mind 1. There is a motorable concreted road about 2_3 km you can reach to a temple starting from the usual hiking point down at Erathna. This is not lit up. But will save your energy for the trip. A SUV is the best to go up this route with steep bends but small cars also were seen making the journey. The last bit is not concreted but about half km has rough terrain with stones. Can go through with a four wheel drive. Villagers at the start point will not give you adequate information but you can reach approximately 2_3 km through this motorable path with no difficulty. 2. The climb is adventurous but tedious. Needs a lot of caution. The foot pathway is by the edge of a steep cliff and if you loose a step you can fall hundreds if feet low. Step carefully as the stones are loose at time may be slippery or the muddy pathway may be washed away partially. 3.Must carry a good torch with good battery life. The foot path is lit up but may need extra light at times. 4. A big rain coat or a poncho will save your rucksack from getting wet during heavy rain fall your are likely to experience. Wear good quality shoes you  will have to walk through ankle deep rain water streams and your shoes need to withstand the water, mud and the rough terrain. Walking through rain is a blessing as it will give constant ice packs to the feet and cool you through out. 5. You need to cross the Seetha Gangula the river holding on to a big rope and walking through the water so if you have kids need to be careful. One slip may cost the life. 6. You are likely to come across creepy crawlies at any time so tired carefully in the pathway. In the thick jungle there will be snakes and dangerous insects. It is infested with leaches.so keep looking for bleeding spots. 7. Take adequate supplies of analgesics, anti-inflammatory spray and plasters, antiseptics for small cuts bandages etc . There are no medical care points till Heramitipana and any type of injury or illness is something you don't want to experience. 8. Take one good warm jacket, mittens and a cap after 12 MN it will be cold till about 5 pm. 9. There are about five shops till you meet the Rathnapura road .all these will serve hot drinks fruit juices, warm food and energising bites at very reasonable prices.they also have polythene rain sacks not very useful but can come handy. Carry your own sweets carbs and water always. 10. Resting places and toilets are very clean but we travelled just at the begining of the season. 11. It is advisable to climb down the Hatton route or take a few hour break at an ambalama.before climbing down the same pathway. 12. Be ready for the best adventure but the scenery and the experience is most remarkable and is a life time experience. 13. The whole journey will take 12_16 hours based on your energy level. If you start at three pm you can reach the peak by 6 pm. 14. The sunrise is most remarkable from this route as it will help you to witness the shadow of Sri Pada on the sky.","December 25, 2021",0.0,0.0

My latest off season experience occurred in September 2020 amid of Corona threat. We did a night hike along the easiest route-Hatton Sri Pada route. (There are six routes to hike Sri Pada and ultimately only two routes bring devotees to the foot print). We two were the only human existence at that time. There were no lights along the path like season. No shops were open. We slept at an Ambalama and reached Uda Maluwa in early morning with hope of Sun rise. But it was mist and gloomy weather.

The plan was to get up at 2am and meet a guide to walk up to the top for sunrise. We ended up cancelling this because we were still shattered from the previous day but seeing the lights in a trail up the mountain, curiosity got the better of us. We decided to do it differently and instead started at 5am while it was still dark and just walked up as far as we wanted (until after sunrise- we stopped about two thirds of the way up which took us a bit over an hour) and I’m so glad we did it. Most of the reviews just talk about the view and the sunrise and how cold it is waiting at the top, but it’s such a brilliant opportunity to be immersed in a cultural experience and religious pilgrimage which is additional to all of these things. You don’t need a guide, just follow the path lined with stalls, follow the lights and the Sri Lankan people. Going up at 5am and then coming back down part way meant we shared the walk with other people but we were the only tourists and we didn’t get held up or stuck in queues by the sheer number of people. I have no doubt the view at the top is beautiful, but for me the experience of Adam’s Peak was about the incredible views and sunrise on the way up, the silhouettes of the monkeys jumping in the trees against the pink sky, trying the sweets from the stalls, the scent of citronella and incense everywhere, the shrines and the lights, someone playing a plastic container as a drum, fresh hoppers for breakfast, the soundtrack of chanting and waterfalls, seeing the families from babies to elderly grandmothers helping each other up and down the steps and feeling the religious significance of this day for so many people walking. We almost didn’t go because we have lots of walks with beautiful views planned but it’s so much more than that. Is it worth it? Yes definitely, but walk it your way and as an experience rather than just a hike.","February 28, 2020",0.0,0.0

Hatton 2. Rathnapura 3. Kuruvita. Hatton is the most popular route with perhaps used by 80% of the people and more or less 99% of the foreigners. It is said to be about 6-7km climb. This route is very well developed with good stairs / railings lot of shops and clean toilets (need to pay Rs.20 to use them). Before the ascend there is a sort of a toll gate where the locals / Buddhists will be given a small sermon. Foreigners can skip this and proceed to a door but they will ask you for a donation. Write the amount in the book and proceed. Avoid climbing during poya days or long weekends as it becomes extremely crowded and you will not be able to reach the summit unless you are prepared to climb one step at 10 minutes speed (am of-course exaggerating), the last 500 or so meters. If you are climbing hatton but if it is really crowded at the top and you do want to reach the summit; there is a road joining the hatton and rathnapura roads so that you can cross over and try your luck with the less crowded rathnapura route but this means adding about 1km more. Be careful of what you eat as last thing you want is a bad stomach. Two of us fell in to that situation and we suspect it was the sweets we bought and ate at the start point. If you are going to stay at the summit and wait for the sunrise then you will need some serious jackets but otherwise though its cold at the base, is is not cold (but sometimes hot) after you start the climb. Tip for Foreigners: Even if you are very physically fit, your legs are going to ache quite bad after the trip so, do not plan anything for the day after but to relax at your hotel. Also the toilets are of the squatting type. Empty your bladder before you reach about the last 1km of your journey as there are no toilets until you reach the top AND you might be stuck in traffic for hours (we were stuck for 4 hours) if its a busy day (and water is not guaranteed at the top) The 2nd most popular route is the Kings Route (Raja Mawatha) starting from Rathnapura. its said to be about 8kms but probably more. Both this route and the Kuruvita route is NOT EASY. Do not attempt if you are not very very physically fit. I understand most locals ascending from this side rest at a rest house (there are over 8 of them along the way) for many hours (sleep) and start. Do your research well before you attempt one of these routes. Also I heard of a tourist who mistakenly descended down this route (which I found strange that they did not realize it because steps are very different on rathnapura side and the landscape is VERY different). Anyway getting a taxi from Rathnapura or Kuruvita back to hatton is going to be very expensive (over 100kms), so becareful that you are descending hatton side. We ascended from hatton and descending down rathnapura side. Rathnapura side is fine until you come to the temple which you see from the top which you ""think"" is the end point and probably similar to the distance you would have descended if you were taking the hatton route. But you are in for a surprise when you are there because the actual journey starts only here! We chose the Kuruvita route which is the longest... over 14kms (felt like 20). Basically you will be ascending and descending few more mountains and arrive at kuruvita. The paths are rough and going in those endless was like playing temple run...(you think its never going to end). In this route you will not come across seats by the road or shops or toilets like you see on hatton road. Basically there will e one shop and toilet roughly every 2Km. Some toilets are very good but some are not at all good. At one point about 8kms down the line you will come to the river. Its extremely clean. You can have bath here. The danger of the kuruvita path is that most of it is through the jungle (but well lit all the way and no known situations of attacks by any animal) so if you hurt yourself there is no way you can be helped out. Given the rough paths it will be very difficult for anyone to lift you and take you to the destination (even air lifting whether possible i do not know). If you are exhausted beyond hope, there is way to get a taxi avoiding the last 4km of the journey. There is a rough path which a trishaw can come. At the police post those phone numbers are there. The 3 wheeler journey takes half and hour to the town (about 6 kms) and only 1 or 2 trishaws. Since the trishaws are high in demand they could act arrogant which we faced and end up waiting nearly 3 hours to get the taxi. Heard Rathnapura Raja mawatha (the original route to siripada) is less distance it is also strenuous with continuous steps for kms and kms. Kuruvita is an excellent tour for hike lovers (this would be the mother of all hikes that you can do in LK). I would recommend ascend from kuruvita and descend hatton BUT with a sleepover / break in midway. This is about a total distance of about 22kms. I would NOT recommend starting from rathnapura ending kuruvita or vice versa. Do not try this route with infants!. Some stupid people does that as we met many such people. Also if it rains while you are taking the kuruvita road, you are done and there are places at some points that if you slip and fall you will fall infintely. This is why you should not attemp this way OFF Season. Hints people taking the Kuruvita Track: Travel light, take a hiking stick, wear GOOD shoes (which can withstand stress - you do not want them broken) and have a flash light in hand. Phones will be useless more or less on your entire journey. I am sorry if i discourage anyone taking the longer routes BUT though its actually challenging and people I know who had struggled with the journey after sometime either forget the hardships but doing so may put someone who is not fit for the journey attempt this (thinking its similar to hatton but just longer) and fall in to trouble. Basically even for the tough guys, it will be more strenuous than you heard or thought it is.. seriously.","February 15, 2020",0.0,0.0

Having left our hotel at 2:30am we had chose to take a 5 minute break to catch our breath deciding that after an hour of walking that we must be about half way...we were not. In fact we had only just started what we later came to call ‘The Proper Climb’ (exchanging the word proper for the occasional expletive during our darker moments). Before moving onto the next stage, it’s worth giving a bit of background to our trip to Adam’s Peak. My wife had very kindly organised a once in a life time trip to Sri Lanka in December of 2019, providing a day by day itinerary of what to expect. Me, being an idiot, did not check said itinerary in nearly enough detail and as such made my first big mistake with regards to Adam’s Peak...pack sporty clothes because you WILL sweat a lot during this climb. Also pack plenty of layers because it’s cold and windy at the top. Oh and water - lots of water. There are plenty of small shops by the path on the way but you’ll pay a premium. Having arrived at the area the night before the climb and realising just what a lengthy journey this was going to be, I swiftly googled how fit someone should be in order to attempt it. Most reviews said ‘a middle level of fitness’. What does middle level of fitness mean? I figured I could run around a football pitch for 90 minutes so was probably ok. If you’re in any doubt yourself, you should be able to walk for a good 5-6 hours on stairs (that’s up and down total). So, back to the stages... Next comes ANGER. This kicked in around the 90 minute mark. The irrational anger at that bl**dy mountain and all it’s s*dding stairs. This transferred swiftly onto anger at the person who organised the whole thing, my wife. You can probably guess how that went so we’ll move swiftly on. Third up is BARGAINING. At around the 2 hour mark my wife and I began to give each other little walking challenges in exchange for small breaks. We’re talking less than 50 meters on stair case between breaks. Then the rain hit... Whilst huddled under the corrugated roof of a path side mud hut drenched in rain and sharing our fun sized Mars bar we hit DEPRESSION. It was make or break time - clearly the mood was dark. Plenty of of others in what had become a communal hiding spot we’re considering turning back. Was it worth getting to the top? Would we even make it in time for sun rise? Then the Mars bar kicked in - it was go time. Finally we had arrived at ACCEPTANCE. Yes we couldn’t have been more wet if we’d taken a flying leap into the nearby river, yes our muscles were begging us to stop but we were 3/4 of way up and had a glorious sun rise to witness. With renewed purpose we powered up to the summit and reached it with around 30 minutes before sunrise (total climb time around 3 hours). As it ended up, we were engulfed by a cloud a didn’t actually see the sun come up. Never mind. This didn’t take away from the immense sense of achievement in making it to the top, nor did it stop the high fives flying with fellow climbers. We’d done it. So why the 5 star review? For us it was the joy of making it all the way up, meeting fellow walkers and sharing stories of our trip. It was pushing these ‘middle level of fitness’ southern fairies to the point of breaking before rewarding us with stunning views (in the end) and a memory that would last a lifetime. Thanks Adam’s Peak. You b*stard.","December 18, 2019",0.0,0.0

We walked early December and we worried we’d be the only people. However there were probably about 100 people walking so a nice amount of people to do it with. The route is well signposted from Dalhousie and there are steps all the way. We started at 3am from the bottom and were up by 5.10am. It’s hard to say how long to factor to do the walk given different peoples fitness and walking speeds but would say most people were up earlier than they expected. I think you could leave at 3.30am and be ok if you’re relatively fit. It’s cold at the top so bring plenty of layers. Some people had to leave because they were too cold. It’s a great challenge - about 1000m of ascent in a short space of time. People saying coming down is harder but going up is definitely harder IMO. The views from the top are nice albeit ruined somewhat by some pretty ugly infrastructure. As we went out of season the temple at the top wasn’t open so may be better in season. However it was busy enough when we did it so imagine it’s crazy in peak season and difficult to reach the top if there’s a lot of people. There’s not a huge amount of space at the top. Getting down took about 80-90 minutes. Enjoy breakfast when you get down! And only book a hostel for the night before. Have breakfast, get an hours kip then head to the station. Definitely worth doing for the experience and easy to jump off the train at Hatton but only 4 stars as the view is a little ruined by some of the buildings on the top.","December 6, 2019",0.0,0.0

It was in October 1980 and one of  many stops on our yourney from Slovakia (Europe) to India, Sri Lanka & Nepal. Except flight Bratislava (the capital of Slovakia) - Sofia (the capital of Bulgaria) it was all toghether by earth and the same way back. This three months journey was & still is something unforgetable. One of stops was sacried Sri Pada.  I have to confess, it was difficult that time to get nearby the Adam´s Peak. We informed  in  tourist offices in Colombo and Kandy. Their answers were all the time same: ""It´s off season, steps are slippery and ascent dangerous.""  Even the obtaining of Sri Lanka´s detailed map  was difficult. Then we were lucky and got the road map. We should get to Maskeliya where one of three trails to the summit started. At about 22 o´clock we got of the bus in Maskeliya, ate some bites in local hut. Against the midnight started our way and then climb to the hilltop of Sri Pada. Thanks bright starry night it was possible to see the contours of a dark mountain range with the rising peak quite away from us. There were about 16 km in front of us,  At this point I jump to the climbing the the most exposed part, to the Peak. That time (off season) nobody was there except two of us. The artificial lighiting was off and completely damaged. There was shining sky only. As we were climbing and nearing to the summit, the mass of the peak was narrowing - more subtle and we were more and more  surrounded by starry sky. It looked like the climb to sky. THIS WAS OUR EXPERIENCE FOR LIFE. After some minutes we reached the summit  and waited for the sunrise. Sorry to say due to fog we did not see the Adam´s Peak shadow, Only a short one after fog dissapeared and sun was up. Nowadays on YOUTUBE channel I see the pilgrimms illuminated path and I guess if there is possible to climb the Sri Pada without lights, but starry sky as we did in 1980.

Climb down is easier with 'base camp' attainable in under 2 hours. A morning ascent is another option which is ideal for scenery sake.Best to begin the trek as early as possible so you would find decent solitude along much of the way until the pilgrims who climbed the night before start to appear out of the mist after 9 in the morning. Visibility up top could be shrouded in mist in most of the months so patience is needed to take a peek at the vista between clouds banks which roll in. The most exhilarating of the climbs would be the attempts done in off season ,between May and December ,much of which falling under the rainy season in the peak wilderness .This climb requires some planning as the rains in better part of the day may bring in cascades all along the route ,as well as down the staircase now turned in to a veritable water slide. Strategy should be to be clear of the mountain before 5 pm as the denizens of the forest would venture out by then.Summit would be occupied by few monks who would depend on weekly supplies from the town below .You may meet the post man who climbs the mountain each day and that would be the only human soul along the route unless there happen to be few others crazy as you. shoes need strong traction /water abundant in many creeks / warm drink in a flask /plenty carb/ biscuits /chocolates./Camera would be a burden unless well protected /clothes ready for a decent dunking /stick to the path ,don't venture out .Keep phone contact with the base in case .Best to report to police station before the climb and make sure to tell them when you come back.

Your legs might feel like jelly and heart will be pounding in your chest, but that is soon forgotten. Before you set off, make sure you climb at night when it’s coolest (a torch is handy for those sections that aren’t very well illuminated); check to see if it is expected to be busy (we did the round trip in 5 hours but heard of people taking 15+ hours at a weekend due to the volume of locals and tourists on the route); wear stout shoes and take warm clothing (it may be warm at the bottom but at night there can be a cold wind at the summit); take plenty of water with you (there are stalls on the way up where you can buy food and drink, but the price goes up with the altitude!). There are also occasional toilet facilities on the way up but you don’t get any niceties for your 30 rupee entrance fee. The best view of the sunrise is just below the summit, before you reach the temple area. And then there’s the descent!! Slow and steady in both directions and you’ll be ok.","April 9, 2019",0.0,0.0

We set off from our nearby guesthouse at 2am and climbed the stairs to peak for sunrise. I'd really recommend starting during the night, as climbing the stairs without the heat of the sun made a huge difference. Don't be put off by people saying it's too difficult (I scared myself a little before we went!) - we peaked in well under 3 hours and although the middle section was a little tougher, with regular breaks we made it to the top no problem. Yes, we were a little achey the next day, but totally worth it! We climbed on a weekday evening, and were pleased to see many more Sri Lankans than tourists climbing. We peaked at around 5am, took a look around and at the footprint, then based on advice we'd seen online started the climb back down before sunrise. We were so glad we'd read this - the top was incredibly crowded and any view would have been blocked by a mass of people and camera screens. The steps on the way back down have a much better view of the sunrise and face east more clearly. We walked 50 or so steps back down and sat to watch the sunrise there.

Last two 2km was very steep and our group was really straggled. But little exercise and preparation could help you If you are not a seasoned hiker or a person who do regular exercises. Avoid holidays and weekend as it’s so crowed in summit and the may be long near summit to enter. Also be prepare to be at the summit at least couple of hours to rest and its always wise to choose Hatton/Nallathanniya route to go downhill as its shorter and easy. There are 03 routes to reach to peak of Sri Pada mountain. First route is Hatton/Nallathanniya route which is about 5 km to the top. This is the easiest. 90% of the people use this route. The second route is Siripagama route (also called Rathnapura route) is about 9 km to the top and you can experience the natural beauty as the trail is though the villages and jungle. However, the route has been modernized in recent past which lost somewhat of its beauty. Third route is the Kuruwita trail which is about 14km hike to the top. I have completed all three routes and but the Kuruwita trail is the most memorable eye pleasing experience.

It’s a religious site for all the main religions on the island-Adam’s footprint at the top for the Muslims, Buddha’s for Buddhists, Lord Shiva’s for  Hindus and for Christians either Adam as well or St Thomas (depending on who you read).  The aim is to arrive before sunrise to experience the wonderful colours and hopefully see the mountain’s reflection in the clouds. We saw both and it was truly amazing. There are various routes but the easiest is via Nallathanni (5000-6000 steps all the same) and that’s the one we took. After parking car you set off with initially a gentle rise but it quickly becomes more challenging as the steps are often higher than a normal stride (around 9”/20cm) Take energy boosting supplies (we took mars bars and energy drinks) although there are small shops (kade) along the way and for any but the fittest, walking poles are a real help, especially coming down. It’s really cold at the top so fleeces/ long trousers necessary. The climbing season is December to April although climbing outside these times is possible but cloud and rain can ruin the experience. Avoid Poya (full moon) days as crowds will be there and even though we went several days after full moon we still had a wait of around 1 1/2 hours on the final stretch. Coming down, for me at least, was the hardest as my knees were finding the descent a real strain.  However, many people of all ages and fitness do make it. We are both in our middle/late 60s and not super fit but did do a little “training” for about 3 weeks beforehand. We took 3 1/2 hours to climb but 4 to come down but the young couple staying next door to us (both looking pretty fit) took 2 1/2 hours up and 1 1/2 down. Your legs are pretty stiff the next day but for me all this was worth the pain. There is something about setting off at 1am to climb a mountain and although I’m not religious, it was a spiritual experience.","March 2, 2019",0.0,0.0

Most tourist get up to the top rather fast paced. Whereas the locals aren‘t in a hurry. The beginning is more or less a walk, when the stairs get steeper and more narrow the whole scenery gets a more dystopian vibe. Exhausted people sitting on stairs, resting. Old people, even on crotches dragging themselves to the top. Aside from the path You are walking you surroundings are completely blacked out. It feels like you are on a ship or a tunnel, the wet and foggy air plays into that perfectly. At the last few hundred meters the steps are getting quite steep and everybody is holding on to those rails. You know everybody‘s goal to get to the top but you don‘t have any idea what it actually looks like up there. It‘s a weird hike into the unknown. Up there it was crowded with people, just sitting in the mist, covered with blankets, keeping each other warm. The lost ship metaphor fits perfectly. Waiting to be saved by the sunrise. We rang the bell one time like we were supposed to. It was a cloudy day but that didn‘ dampen our experience. It was a relief, when the darkness was lifted and you could see your surroundings in daylight. It was demystifying, the dirt and waste covered areas near the stairs. It felt like being out all night, walking home, when the new day took his place, while wondering how different the world around you looks. Overall we loved it and told everybody about our experience.

We climbed the stairs for three hours (going at a modest pace with plenty of water/rest breaks in between) and thought we were just about to reach the summit when our journey came to a sudden halt... There were thousands (no exaggeration) of people ahead of us - all stopped! This was the line people had been talking about! Only, it wasn't some short queue like at the grocery store - it was interminable! We waited for 2.5 hours in the line, but only managed to move maybe 75 more steps towards the summit in that time. The chill combined with the anger of watching unashamed tourists blatantly skip the line by climbing through the bushes made those 2.5 hours absolutely miserable, too. We watched the sunrise in line around 5:30am (still gorgeous!), but finally decided to turn back around 7:15 am -- 6 hours into our journey -- once it became clear that we would be waiting another 3-5 hours (again, no exaggeration) in that line if we wanted to get to the top! In the end, we got back to our hotel after 10 am. A 9 hour adventure, and no summit. :( So disappointing! It wasn't a poya day. It wasn't a holiday. It was just crazy busy! We don't even think that leaving earlier would have made a difference, as the number of people was overwhelming. People from our hotel who went during the day seemed to have better luck... One other thing - several reviewers noted that going down the mountain was only a 1-2 hour affair. We found it to be 3+ hours... and that wasn't even getting to the top!","February 11, 2019",0.0,0.0

The worries went on. But my other more calmer pragmatic half told me to just do it...and I'm so glad I did. Yes it was hard, walking all those steps isn't gonna be easy, but there are hand rails for the steep ones and there's just no rush, pace yourself and take it easy - it's totally doable. Plus if 80 year olds with sticks and pregnant ladies also carrying another child can do it, then anyone can do it. Yes it's busy but not consistently, there were busier patches around rest stops and steeper parts but that's good as you get to have a rest too. And despite it being a national holiday it wasn't as bad as people made out. It was busy at the top, so the last 150 meters we queued but I was glad as I could the steep steps one at a time and rest in between. People around me (my other half was ahead) were friendly and kept me going especially one old chap who kept telling me only X amount of meters! Yes it's cold at the top so do take layers and will more than likely have to sit on the floor so maybe a small blanket is a good idea. But it's not long before the sun's up and it gets hot again so bring sun cream too! Yes it's difficult walking at night, but again just prepare yourself. drink plenty of water, take or buy snacks along the route and take rests when you need them. Overall it's so worth it, the views are amazing, the experience is one I'll never forget, the people are so interesting and friendly. For some this really is a pilgrimage, to heal them, to bless them and it humbles you. I was quite emotional at the top, probably from the pure exhilaration of doing it and tiredness but also witnessing so many people to whom it meant so much was so special.

Anyway, this is a non-technical hike in that 90% of it is steps, but it's still pretty tough on your body - 1000m or vertical ascent over 5500 steps is going to hurt pretty much anyone who isn't a mountain runner!  The start of the most common hike from Hatton Road is somewhere in the middle of Dalhoosie - it's not marked anywhere, I assume it's somewhere past the bus station, maybe at the first bridge you cross?  Anyway, it's possible to get slightly lost early on, so check if you're not sure (ask a local, there'll be a few around!)  You'll also get accosted by local monks too, so be sure to take some rupees for donations!  The hike is strenuous and while it'll probably feel a bit cold at the start you'll soon warm up.  Make sure you take something warm for the top though as you'll soon cool down up there before the sun comes up.  You'll need food and water for the hike, but you don't need to load up like I did, there are many many vendors selling food, drinks and clothing right the way from the bottom to (almost) the top, so you can get stuff en route if need be (in my defence, I was trying to reduce my plastic footrpint!)  If you take it steady you'll have no issues, but the thing to remember is that seventy year old women do this barefoot in the rain, so it shouldn't be a problem for most people.  Dont get me wrong, it's not easy - it's not supposed to be, it wouldn't be much of a pilgrimage otherwise - but I'd say it's absolutely doable for most people, just give yourself a little more time if you're not 100% sure of yourself.  The top is very busy and for some reason the temple doesn't get opened up until after sunrise (not sure if this has always been the case?) so the steps up will be very crowded.  Get up a little earlier to get a decent position for the sunrise if possible.  I did it during peak season, though on a non-poya weekday, and it was still very crowded, so expect quite a few people up there jostling for position when the sun comes up!  The temple is a little disappointing visually, but it's the spiritual side that matters I guess, certainly this seemed to be the case for the locals when they got up there.  Be sure to also get a photo looking west when the sun comes up, where the shadow of the mountain is cast onto the horizon.  Also don't underestimate the journey down - your tired, lactic-acid-filled legs will be fighting against you so be a little careful!  And don't make plans for any major hikes for at least a couple of days afterwards - it'll take a bit of time for your body to recover.  Overall though, a very good experience, I'd say well worth doing as it's genuinely a bit of a challenge, and I think if you keep in mind the spiritual pilgrimage background to this hike you'll probably enjoy it a lot more.","January 11, 2019",0.0,0.0

The views from there are even better, as there is no fence or wire covering the sight. So I would recommend doing this no matter the season. After the sunrise most tourists went straight down again, so I waited for the crowds to clear and climbed the last bit. Best choice! You can actually get a feeling for the place and the people praying/chanting, amazing energy. Spent nearly an hour at the top, just taking in the scenery. If you're super fit you'll manage to go up in 2 hours. I'm in the worst shape of my life and it took me 2,5h, although I was really hurrying. (I actually took a wrong turn in the beginning and didn't realize until after 1 hour, so by the time I got to the beginning of the stairs it was already 3:30. Oh, the horror!) So for people with no sense of orientation like myself, maybe check out the entrance the day before. The walk up there is some proper full-on, though unwanted ;), kardio.","January 3, 2019",0.0,0.0

We arrived in plenty of time for the sunrise and were able to see the temple and footprint beforehand, as well as the dawn ceremony by the Buddhist monks.

The views are very nice. We climbed up the mountain on December 16 which was a Sunday and we hardly met any people. We learned that the program season starts on the first full moon of December so we were lucky going up five days before. Because it was not the high season a lot of shops were closed which was not a problem for us. Please make sure that you bring enough water and sunscreen. The summit itself is not so interesting as it is only a minor temple with limited relevance unless you have religious motives. We reach the summit at 11:30 AM and we experienced breathtaking views in every direction.  In the beginning it was a little chilly because we were of course sweating a lot. After 20 minutes and after changing our shirt we sat down in the sun and it was actually very warm. The way down was a little bit more challenging as I have problem with my left knee.

So it might not be for everybody. If the shape is not the best, remember to have enough time. We started walking at 02.40 and were on the top at 05.10. I think we went in an average tempo, and we also had some stops here and there. Why so early? To reach the sun rise at 06.00! The view at sunrise was really, really beautiful, and a great reward for climbing in the darkness for hours. We went off season (season starts in December I think). This means fewer people, fewer open «shops» along the way, and less lights. So if you go off season - bring flash, light, water and some food. And bring some warm clothes to wear when you’re up, it might get cold. The way down goes faster of course, but can be a little hard for legs and knees.

We went off season so when we got up there the little temple was closed so we couldn’t see the footprint that the Buddhists climb up to see, this was probably a good thing as I have heard you can get close to the top and then have to start queuing to climb the last leg. If you do go out of season make sure you take a torch, head torch is probably the best, also make sure you take plenty of water, you’ll need it.","October 28, 2018",0.0,0.0

We decided not to use a guide which was fine as there were signs showing us where to go.  Luckily we took a small amount of money with us as we were greeted at a Temple at the beginning of the walk by a monk who requested we sign our names into a register book and make a small donation before he blessed us and wished us good luck.  The walk quickly changes from gradual rising easy slopes into continuous steps.  The view throughout the walk is breathtaking with lots of photo opportunities.  The last 20 minutes of the walk is probably the hardest and steepest, though being able to see the temple at the top is motivating.  Besides the spectacular view at the top you will not find much else except the temple, which was not accessible when we were there. As we left our hotel too late to see the sunrise we were lucky enough to pass may travellers coming down from the peak and when we arrived at top we were the only people up there. The climb down is much easier and quicker.  This walk took us just over 4 hours. A great way to start the day, I would certainly do this walk again.","October 6, 2018",0.0,0.0

First for some practical advice. You will need: *A torch (essential as it is pitch black and you can’t do it without one) *1.5 litres of water per person *idealy some high energy snacks, we haf breakfast bars and that was fine * rainjacket, unless of course you are travelling in peak season in which case maybe not *comfortable shoes or trainers (I worr running shoes and was fine) *a change of tshirt for the way down (you get sweaty on the way up) Start time: 2.30am Arrival at the top: 5.30am Finish at the bottom: 8am So, we started this walk at 2.30am, like most other people. We booked a hostel very closeby, a mere 10 minutes walk which was super handy. As you start there are a few street stalls where there you can but water, and some sell torches. There are also lots of large and interesting shrines. For the first 20 minutes or so the walk is quite pleasant, and is actually well lit in some areas. After however as the steps begin the walk gets a bit tougher. The steps were fine, there were just a lot of them. About mid-way, after 1.5 hours walking, is when the walk became more arduous. The steps become steeper, and you need to rest at regulat intervals. There was drizzling rain on and off up the walk which was not a problem as we had our rain jackets, but did mean we got very hot and sweaty. We were not the only ones feeling the burn, everyone around us were healthy looking, and were also hving to rest every 10 minutes of so. After about 2.5 hours of walking it started lightening up a touch and we could see the peak, which really spurred us on. The final stretch is another arduous bit, but by that point you are used to it. In terms of the top itself, it was very misty and there was no sudden breaking of dawn. The temple itself was closed and so 30 or so tourists and some Sri Lankans sat around watching the sunrise. The views were nice, but as we were a bit cold my brother and I changed into a spare, dry shirt we brought and headed off. It was only as we headed down that we really got a sense of how the beautiful the place was. There were waterfalls, forested areas, a few monkeys, and beautiful mists floating around. It really was worth it for the views back down! I would recommend this walk to any healthy persons happy for a hard couple of hours of walking. We went off season and the weather was okay. Cool, but not too rainy. I would just note that the village of Dalhousie itself although very tranquil and pretty was also pretty much dead. The coffee shops were empty, and I felt fortunate that our hostel had a restaurant as the restaurants around werent especially inviting. We also wanted to buy a few basic toiletries (mouth wash, some ulcer gel) and the shops did have any of it, so just make sure you have everything you need when you hear over. Do Adam’s Peak walk, so long as you go in expecting to have to work your legs you’ll very likely have a great time!","October 4, 2018",0.0,0.0

There isn't much space at the top, and I think at least 100 tourists came down as we went up.  The climb took us 2 hours from the hotel and the descent just over an hour. So if you are quite fit and don't want to sit in the dark for 2 hours consider starting a bit later in off season! A daytime ascent would probably also be a good choice in bad weather.

Then there is a LOT more windy road driving and climbing upwards and upwards. This is tea plantation countryside. We arrive at Adams Peak and check-in. It's the Sri Lankan New Year and at this time they take the opportunity to do a pilgrimage to their favourite religious site. Be it Buddhism, Hindu or Christianity - Adams Peak applies. And so it came to be that we now have a true insight into what a pilgrimage is. What an extraordinary thing to do and experience and witness. What a test of mind and body. If you want to experience 1000's upon 1000's of people at once practicing respect and empathy for one another this is it. For us it took 3 1/2 hours to climb up the 5500 steps, starting at 5:30pm. For some people take days to do the ascent. We saw parents carrying their infants in their arms or on their shoulders. No back packs to carry kids in here, no what we would consider appropriate footwear either. Jandals and bare feet are everywhere. We saw toddlers climbing. We saw elderly that defied belief that they could do this climb. We saw people with disabilities, crutches even. We saw people sleeping in the rest stops, showering in the places to bathe, eating in food shops, sitting wherever they felt the need. We chose to spend half an hour at the top.   For others they were sleeping already waiting for the sunrise and others were settling in in the cold.  There they were sitting with children asleep in their arms about to wait the next nine hours out until sunrise. Some had the same sense of pride and wonder to them as we felt others were quietly and gently praying. There was nothing of significance to see here, just the knowledge and/or belief that it may exist. That is the first footprint on earth of Buddha, Adam or .....  and then 3 hours for the descent After midnight we swallowed some panadol after we use our hands to lift our legs into bed with the hope that in the morning we will feel fine.   Bahahahahahahahaha.   We remind our children and ourselves that one day this will make more sense than it does right now.

While there is no denying that the climb was challenging, it is not impossible for those who don't deem themselves super fit. I still thoroughly enjoyed this experience! The sunrise was incredible, the best spot to get a good view was about 20 metres back down from the summit along the final section of stairs looking back towards the sun rising. Many other places at the summit were hard to see due to the large crowd however the stairs gave everyone their own uninterrupted views. My favourite part (other than the sunrise) was watching the elderly women make their pilgrimage with their families, and watching the various religious groups chant prayers at each other as they pass on the stairs. I would recommend spending a little extra time at the top as many tourists immediately start their descent after the sun has risen. The prayer hour at the top is quite special with mostly locals only participating. The views on the way down are just as impressive and are better enjoyed without the large number of tourists rushing their way down. Adam's Peak can easily be reached by getting off the train in Hatton and then the local bus to Nallathanniya. If you time your trains well from Ella, Kandy, Nanu Oya or Colombo, Adam's Peak should only take 1 night/morning out of your Sri Lanka itinerary as there is not much else to see or do in the area. I would recommend arriving in Nallathanniya late afternoon or evening, and then leaving as soon as you descend Adam's Peak.","May 23, 2018",0.0,0.0

So, if you are going in April plan to leave very early or use this side trail to reach the top. A few comments: It was mainly Sri Lankan people making the trek to the top of Adam's Peak ranging from babies to elderly. The lowest temperature was 12C so unless you are waiting at the top for a while or you come from a very warm climate a light sweater and a hat is sufficient. There were lots of places to buy snacks along the way and lots of toilets although the toilets were not in great condition.

It includes Sri Lanka’s 2nd highest mountain, Sri Pada or Adam’s Peak at 2243m above sea level. The mountain is considered sacred to different religions and has many different names, but it is usually known as Sri Pada (= Sacred Footprint) or Adam’s Peak. It’s isolated conical shape is very distinctive and visible for miles. On a clear day, it is said that, from the summit, you can see Colombo, 65km away. Sri Pada is associated with Buddha, but long before Buddhism arrived in Sri Lanka in 246 BCE, the mountain was already being revered as the home of the god Saman. Then it was called Samanelakhanda (= Saman’s mountain). The Sacred Footprint, a large indentation in the rock at the summit, is said to be made by Buddha himself on one of his 3 journeys here, although Muslims consider the footprint to be that of Adam, when he was first cast out of Paradise. Christians claim that it was made by St Thomas, the early apostle of India, and Hindus consider that it was made by Lord Shiva. Although the appearance of the rock indentation is like that of a print of a left foot, it was not made by any of these worthies. At more than 1m long, it was more probably made by Bigfoot. Nevertheless the mountain and the ‘footprint’ are revered by several religions and pilgrims mingle with determined foreigners to climb Sri Pada. There are many different routes to the top, but probably the most popular starts at Dalhousie, 33km from Hatton and, after 5,500 uneven steps, between 2½ and four hours, and 7km later you should arrive at the summit. The peak pilgrimage time is between Poya Day in December and the Vesak Festival in April/May but the busiest time is January to February. During the peak period the route up is lit and there are many tea houses along the way. Most visitors come to see the ‘footprint’ in its little temple, ring the bell and await the dawn. If you leave Dalhousie at about 2.30am you should, pedestrian traffic permitting, reach the top at dawn. But be advised that after a strenuous climb, it will seem very cold on the 165m2 summit and very crowded in the peak season, but if you avoid weekends and Poya Days, you can also avoid the biggest crowds. The return journey, down those steps, though is a killer, particularly if you are not fully fit. For the climb you will need some warm clothing, maybe a plastic raincoat, water, energy snacks, good stout shoes, a lemon to deal with the leaches and a determination to succeed. There is an off-peak season when few people climb, but there is a good reason for that. It is usually wet, cloudy, cold and slippery.","May 1, 2018",0.0,0.0

We are not as fit as we used to be and it took us four days to recover fully from the hike. Seriously suggest leaving this to the locals who feel it's their utmost religous duty to climb this mountain and this was evident by elderly women climbing in utter pain and locals shocked at us turning around near the top in disbelief. I think western tourists should give them some extra room rather than clogging up the top waiting for a photo of the sunrise or selfie.","April 23, 2018",0.0,0.0

I would only recommend doing it if you're religious. It's just one big commercialised walk with shops selling over priced food and tacky toys all the way up. Bright lighting so you don't feel like you're surrounded by nature and can't see the stars (which is the thing I love most about sunrise treks) it's very dirty, full of litter and the smell coming from the 'toilets' is unbearable. There are so many people trying to walk to the top, that around 300m from the top (I am guessing) we came to a complete stand still, we didn't move for around 20 mins and that's when I decided to decenf back down and just watch the sunrise as I was walked, many others joined along the way. It's a very long way to walk only to be disappointed. I am usually one to read bad reviews and still love the place I'm visiting, but on this rare occasion I agree with the bad reviews. Especially as there is nothing else to do in nallathanniya (where the mountain is based) other than Adams peak so I feel we wasted 2 of our days in Sri Lanka which is sad because it has been my favourite country of the trip. Little Adams peak is so much better in Ella so I would recommend going there instead.","April 22, 2018",0.0,0.0

There is nothing wrong with this of course, however it is quite far from a hike in the nature. If you are looking for that, Ella Rock or Little Adams peak are much better.

While I don’t regret we did it, I’m not sure if it was totally worth it.  We started our climb a little before 2 am in the early Monday hours so we could make the sunset.  When you start the walk there is an entrance where monks will try to get you to sign your name and give a donation.  Just remember you don’t have to and can walk past them, this climb is free. We aren’t super fit people but do exercise regularly and go on hikes.  This was without a doubt the most physically taxing thing I have ever done.  I think the main issue for us was that the steps upward were so super wide that one step felt like five.  We took constant breaks but still felt drained as the steps kept going endlessly.  Also, it was very sad to see the endless trash just littered along the entire way we were walking. Around 5:00 am the walk became super steep and very narrow and we basically got stuck because there were so many people.  We thought we would miss the sunrise but managed to get into the gates at the top around 6:00 am to wait for the 6:16 sunrise.  It was so incredibly packed and uncomfortable that it was hard to enjoy this beautiful moment and accomplishment.  Plus the sunrise was a bit of a letdown since it was cloudy.  Going down was much easier and we even did a massage at the bottom.  Unfortunately our muscles were so sore that we couldn’t walk for about 3 days after. So yes, this is an incredibly spiritual climb especially when you see all the people climbing beside you and their devotion to this.  But it is also extremely difficult and packed and you might not see anything up Adam’s Peak if the weather doesn’t cooperate.  So just consider those things before you embark on this journey.","April 13, 2018",0.0,0.0

I would advise finding a position lower down on the steps for a better view of the sunrise as crowds tend to amass on the peak and consequently obscure any good spots.

We felt disrespectful trying to catch a glimpse of the views while locals are there praying and trying to use the temple for its purpose. As it was so crowded (and we did not go on a weekend or full moon, about 300 tourists) we couldn't even see the sunrise. We tried to start the trek back down early but we're stuck behind a large crowd bottlenecked down a single file stairway. We felt that the effort was not worth the payoff.

We could have made it in two hours time but we took our time thinking the road to the top will be longer and much more difficult. Thé truth is, if you are not used to any kind of effort, this task will be a tedious one. If you have stomach issues in the morning, do not attempt to do it, the toilets that you will find on the way are bellow any standard. People keep talking about leeches and stuffing their socks in their long pants....what a joke...just put a pair of good trekking shoes, a short and a t-shirt, I guarantee, you will sweat a lot.

But it can be very crowded in weekends and especially on full moon Poya days and Tamil New Year. For those who are interested in the number of steps, i counted them and my count was 4558 steps counted from the gate near the lying buddha to the bell at the top. But it is not very accurate because there are some splits in the path (near the stupa). The temple at the top isn't big and the only interesting things are the Adam's footstep (photographs not allowed) and the bell who you can ring when you complete the climb. My tips to get to the top without trouble: - It can be advisable to do a smaller climb a week prior to the Adam's Peak (like Sigiriya Rock or Mihintale) - Go during the pilgrim season (december to may) because the path is illuminated at night (it's also nice for photos!) - Avoid full moon Poya and weekends if possible, please also avoid the week before and the week after Tamil new year (mid April)! Otherwise you will struck intonthe crowds and you won't reach the top. - Pack enough food to replenish your energy during the climb and do not forget to bring a bottle of water to avoid dehydration. There are numerous shops along the paths to get food / drinks, so you can also purchase extra when running out of supplies. - Wear good walking shoes or booths to avoid blisters and foot injuries. - Walking poles can be a good use during the descent to reduce pain in your knees. There are also handrails in the upper part of the path.","April 9, 2018",0.0,0.0

At the bottom of the mountain it already was quiet crowded and as we ascended it got even worse. Of course it was the weekend so we expected it to be more busy. The hike is totally exaggerated by pretty much every review I found online - it’s just not that exhausting and bad as people make it sound. Seriously people, do you ever move? My favorite quotes were all the “I’ve never done something that exhausting in my life” - sad... On the top it’s just freaking ugly and because of all the buildings you can’t see anything of the surrounding nature that’s actually really pretty... We managed to get really great places to watch the sunrise (which unfortunately wasn’t that special today, not the peaks fault though). All in all it was terribly underwhelming and we’re glad we mostly stay away from this kind of touristy crap. This country has sooooo much more special places to offer!

No need to hurry if u start at 2 am cause it took us 2h30 to go up and we took many breaks up there then it's colder its good to have a blanket or jumper to cover im yourself from the colder temperature If u arrive early on the top u would more chances to get a place to seat around the temple otherwise on the stairs u have aswell plenty of space to watch the amazing sunrise What a magical view after the walk!!

Following previous reviews we decided to leave our accomodation at 3am, starting the climb at 3:30 and arriving at the top in 2.5 hours for the start of sunrise. This meant we were not waiting in the cold for sunrise. We packed plenty of layers of warm clothes and were able to experience the prayer call at the top. The walk was challenging at parts but we had plenty of breaks, the steps were well maintained and it was only last little bit at the top that was really busy. Almost at stand-still up the steps by the temple but we perceived and got through to the other side which had a lot more space, great views, the large bell, flame, and also toilets (these were free, not 30 or 50rs like the others). There are plenty of stalls selling food and drink along the way, both hot and cold. And we noticed a number of drinking water filters inside the shops, so take a bottle and refill from there to save on the plastic waste (you will notice on the way down - in the daylight - just how much rubbish is left along the path and also the incredible people who carry huge crates of drinks up on their backs to be sold).

It will take about 2-3 hours to get up all the way so you may be standing/sitting around for a while waiting for the sun to come up. After the sweat of the climb it's bitterly cold!

There are plenty of shops/cafes open along the ascent offering tea/coffee and snacks. At the bottom there seems to be a first aid station there as well. Along the route there are also squat toilets available. Most of the path is well lit, though there are a couple of sections (for a few metres) not lit, so I would advise you to ensure you have a flashlight on your mobile phone (no need for a head torch). I am quite a fit male adult so the ascent took me 2hrs and I did not even break a sweat. I had hoped it would be a bit more strenuous. You share the steps with a lot of locals making the pilgrimage as of course this is a holy ascent for many different religions. Once at the top ring the bell, take a seat on the large steps facing East and wrap up. Make sure to take gloves, hat and even maybe a blanket (many people up there had one). It is very chilly and windy at the top. I would advise getting to the top maybe 1-2hrs before, maybe 2hrs before. This might seem excessive but in doing so you can get a good seat on the large steps facing east. If you arrive just in time for sunset you will not get far as it becomes very packed at the top and everyone is jostling for space to see the sunrise. There are toilets at the top.

Worth doing but be aware it’s not easy. Path is lit during the busy season (December-April I think) and lots of shops en route up for snacks and water etc. So you don’t need to take lots with you.

It is more than climbing and taking the photos of the sunrise. Adam’s Peak is the place of coexistence of different religions and peoples. The 5500 steps give you time to reflect on yourself, to test your physical strength and willpower, to enjoy the beauty and power of the nature, to meet and talk to Buddhists, Christians, Muslims, Hindus or just tourists as  you, and to became part of thousand years of pilgrimage. We went to the Adam‘s Peak from Dalhousie, at the beginning of February, on the middle of the week, far from full moon, during the terrifying monsoon rain which didn’t discourage us to climb. We needed practically 4 hours to the top.  We started early, at 1:30 AM and monsoon stopped letting us to advance slowly but firmly, decided to make it coûte que coûte . To prepare you, just look at others reviews, best and worst, it will help you to take what you really need and to climb the Adam’s Peak in best possible way.  Don't carry too much food and drink as you can find it along the way. Don’t forget the gloves and warm cap, some cloths to change at the top.  You can buy a very good (and warm) raincoat for 500 Rs at the local market in Dalhousie. I would recommend you to take the walking sticks. Mine were more than useful. It is not easy to climb up 5500 steps and quite difficult to climb them down, it is cold and wet but when you reach the top, you will know that it is unique and beautiful. The kindness of the local people, pilgrims of all ages including children, and calm of the food sellers, is a good therapy for the hurried and upset tourists. Think that you are climbing the holly mountain. Stop time to time, take a cap of tea or just a bottle of water, excellent Hawaian Cookies, and rest at small stands along the way.  Take your time, don’t push your physical forces, stop if necessary, and enjoy the nature around you including the night frog’s song if you climb at night. Once on the top, pay tribute to the sacred footprint of Buddha/Adam. You will have to take your shoes off but you can do it just next to the Temple and keep them with you. Don’t be afraid to step on the cold and wet stone, it worth the effort. It is not obligatory to leave the money, but it is always good to give something to the Gods, so pay what you want, even 100 Rs would be good. Don’t forget to ring a bell as many times as you reached the Peak ! You can find on your right, going up, just before reaching the Temple, the shelter where the local people coming from around Sri Lanka use to take a rest. It is crowded but they will let you some place, if not you can stay on the covered and warm entry. Be on time to take a good position for the sunrise. The first ray enlightening the Adam’s Peak is as the first ray that God sent to the Earth. Beautiful. We didn’t have chance to see the shadow of Adam’s Peak but we don’t regret it. Even if we would miss the sunrise, climbing this holly mountain would be enough to keep this moment as one of the best of our life.","March 6, 2018",0.0,0.0

Random stalls selling cheap tat, anything from a pink teddy bear to a remote control helicopter! It was bizarre. Then the climb began it was rammed, I expected a few tourists but they were there in mass groups all chattering and yelling between themselves...I wondered if they actually knew what Sri Pada was, especially as these tourists barged their way through in shorts and sports tops. It was humbling to watch some of the really old local people climbing up there, clearly struggling but determined - a true pilgrimage. I my minds eye, the little tea shops on the way up were quaint little places ran by a local family, how naive! They like the stalls at the bottom, only most had Asian dance music blaring out from them. To the top. So this is a place of great religious significance for Buddhists, Hindus, Muslims and Christians, at the top you are asked to removed your shoes and head ware and do not photograph and record in and around the temple - in other words show some respect! Massive groups of Germans, Chinese and mixtures of other tourist hoards were all gathered up there for the sunrise - many had put their shoes back on, head ware back on, all yelling and screaming at each other taking selfies - it was embarrassing, after 15 minutes at the top I came back down is disgust. Personally if I was a local religious person I would not want the tourists allowed up there, but if you take the loud gobshite tourist away then the local businesses would suffer - its a tough one.

Adam's Peak has got to be the most challenging thing we have done to date. At times we were ready to give up and head back to the hotel; but we persisted. As with previous reviews we met people of all ages going and coming back down again. In fact, it was the 'older' pilgrims that made us realise that if they could do it so could we. It was also encouraging to see that some of the younger (more athletic) walkers/climbers were also finding the climb tiring. We saw them race off at a pace that would get them to the top in record time, but found them struggling to cope with major 'muscle burn' at some of the rest stops on the way. The climb is made more challenging by the fact that the steps are not even. They vary in height so take care on the way up but also on the way down, because just as you get into a rhythm you come across a step which is almost twice the height which will jar you knees. We set off at 2 am and made it to the top at around 6 am. We also had a local guide with us who was useful at the top, but not so useful on the way up as we always seemed to be on 2 km from the top. As others have mentioned it gets crowded at the top, and this was where our guide helped us. He found a way through them to find a great place to view the sunrise. It was truly spectacular and the view from the top was all I had hoped for. we were even able to see the shadow of the mountain on the mist. At 7am the shrine enclosing the foot print was opened and we were allowed to enter. Remember, this is a place of worship and locals are there to make offerings and to pray, so please be respectful. Do not miss the chance to experience the climb, even if you cannot make it to the very top, you will be rewarded with incredible views of the surrounding area.","March 3, 2018",0.0,0.0

Unfortunately I was there in August which technically is off season (for pilgrimage), so there was absolutely no one except for me and my friends and the very kind dogs. We reached the place quite late in the afternoon and didn't intend to hike the whole thing either, so we only did a few kilometres before heading back. Adam's peak is meaningful for various religions, and I can't deny that there was a mystical feeling about the place. It was peaceful, and had some amazing views while hiking up, but do beware of leeches though. By the time we reached the bottom the mist already covered the mountains. Anyway I shall definitely try this hike again and hopefully the entire way to the top!","February 26, 2018",0.0,0.0

It is also a very sacred place and important to Buddhists, Muslims, Christians and Hindus. It is not a physical challenge for nothing.. no pilgrimage ever is. You will probably do around 25k steps from bottom to top and down again and unless you are physically fit or a spring chicken, you will find this a strenuous activity. Having said that, every time my resolve wavered as I climbed one step after another, I looked at the people around me. My companions ranged from little ones of 5, to parents who carried their babies in their arms, to grandmothers and grandfathers well into their 70s or 80s, often helped by family members arm in arm. That to me was the essence of climbing Adam’s Peak. It spoke to me of the strength of family ties and the need to rely on others in life, that one can’t and shouldn’t go through life alone. The downside to this amazing place is the commercialisation, the shops and the resultant rubbish that accumulated along the way. Who can blame people for making a living? It’s the tourist who is probably at fault for most of the rubbish here. The saying “take nothing but pictures, leave nothing but memories” is pertinent here. Other reviewers comment on the steepness of the steps and the cold at the top of you go before sunrise. All true. But so worth the effort of seeing the sun rise above the eastern hills.

There are food stalls that sell water, tea, coffee, and snack food, but they don't have that. That said, watching the sunrise from up at the peak is breath-taking and is not to be missed.

But once you break through that wall the walk becomes easier, even if the steps become steeper. My group of 6 and I did it in exactly 3 hours, and that was with a lot of very lengthy stops. There are places to grab snacks, fruit and water at consistent intervals all the way up the mountain. Definitely bring a thick jumper or blanket with you, as the summit is FREEZING! Also be prepared to share the summit with ALOT of likeminded people. It can get pretty crowded up there waiting for the sunrise. The walk down is much quicker, and with the sun up, you get to take in all the amazing views at different levels! I think this is a must do when in SL. Side note; please be respectful to SL culture and customs. Inside the temple area at the summit there is a big sign to remove footwear and also to not take photos of the temple itself. Yet I saw SO MANY non-Sri Lankans wearing shoes (until being told by police to remove them) and taking selfies with the temple. If you're going to visit Sri Lanka and monuments sacred to them, just please exercise some respect :)","February 3, 2018",0.0,0.0

A - Try NOT to go on Sat or Sun because all the Sri Lankans are off work and they will be there. It has been a pilgrimage site for at least 800 years (Marco Polo mentioned it in 1200) and it remains an important destination for them. If you have to go on those days, consider getting a guide. We had one and he took us on a short cut, which was actually a cut over to the second, less used path to the top. (Looking at Google maps satellite imagery I am 90% certain it was the Adiyamala Thenna Geththarpana footpath but I did not confirm this with the guide or any locals). This way was not crowded and we walked right up to the top. (DON'T however go back down this way without a guide, because if you miss the footpath cut off, you will walk down 14 km, instead of 7 km AND you will be in the wrong town, which is a 2 hour drive back to Nallathannia - per our guide). The people on the main route were backed up & stopped at least 500 meters below the top and they did not make it to the top for sunrise. Indeed they were still standing/sitting on the stairs when we went down that way about 45 min after sunrise. Apparently none of the other (young & fit) hikers, who stayed at our hotel the night before, made it to the top today because of that issue. B - Unless you are really on a Pilgrimage or unless it is a week day and the Temple is wide open,  there is no need to stand in the line to walk through the Temple. First,  the Sri Lankans waiting in line were incredibly rude & aggressive. One of them hit my wife with his backpack to push her to the side and then pulled his friend up into her spot. Also, inside you get two seconds while they hustle you through like cattle AND the actual footprint is covered with Holy cloth etc. so you can't even see it. Instead of standing in that line, stake out a good spot to view the sunrise. C - If you take the cutover, take a headlight or good flashlight for each person. It's a trail, not stairs,  and there are no lights along the path. D - If you have bad joints or weak quads, consider taking a cane or 1 or 2 walking sticks, for the way down. Going up is a cardiovascular stress test, but coming down will cause pain in any arthritic joints you may have AND by the halfway point your quads will be Jello. Walking sticks would have helped a great deal. The photos are: 1-The lights along the top of the path at 2 am. 2-The hordes of people about 500 meters from the top,  completely stopped and still waiting to get to the top at 7am. 3- Sunrise from near the top.","January 29, 2018",0.0,0.0

It gets gradually tougher and tougher and it’s best to take a breath and stop for a few minutes . You will be soaked in sweat by the time you reach the top . It could be worse and the ascent could be on a slippery slope but it’s stone steps the whole way . There are stone steps to sit whilst waiting for sunrise and a temple above plays Bhajans and Music . It’s a special space . It’s very windy on the summit . Wear long trousers and bring a jumper and scarf . It’s a wait for sunrise from 4 am so wrap up The sunrise and views of the sky are awesome at the time of sunrise . You don’t have to get there too early - at 4 am I had a few teas for 100 rs each and spoke to random people . In reality you can arrive at 6 am for the sunrise .

It was a very reverential experience and we didn’t see another foreign tourist until 700m from the summit - we took a good amount of warm clothes - I had extra pants (thin), cardigan, jacket, rain jacket, beanie. My partner had the same without the cardi. We also bought a thin blanket at Nuwara Eliya which was extremely helpful.

Get prepared, it won't be easy. But really rewarding. You don't need any special climbing skills, as the path is always with stairs. At the last part, you will find handrails. However, you need to be physically prepared. Go soon, so you have time to stop some times. Take warm clothes. We were there in the summer, the night was hot, but the temperature and the wind at the top... freezing! (After the climbing, your clothes will be wet, which makes it worst). Despite all that, the views are undescribable. We saw one of the most beautiful sunrises ever! (And already seen que a few, in some iconic places). I would imagine that even if we didn't had the sunrise, the moment when the morning ceremonies occurred, was magical. One thing, try to respect those ceremonies and people who go there because of their faith. Avoid make to much noise and throttling around in front of them (as, unfortunately, many tourists do).

Nothing compares to 5,500 steps up & back down again. Don’t worry though - every age, shape & size is going up - from 90 years olds, to 3 year old kids. If you get puffed, or need a break, do what the locals do, just take a 10 minute break on the steps & get going again when ready. What to wear! Walking up can be very hot & sweaty - we all wore sportswear - shorts & a singlet/t-shirt & good shoes. When the pace slows due to the crowds near the top, you will need to pull out a long sleeve top & leggings/track pants etc and a beanie/hoodie will be useful.....you’ll need them because it is cold at the top. We did the walk on a Sunday - which is the busiest day for locals - probably between 3,000 - 5,000 locals! (No accurate estimate there was that many people!) It took us 6 hours, leaving at midnight - which included 2 hours slow wait when 300 meters from the top. I would recommend doing Adam’s Peak mid-week (Tues - Thurs) and avoid the weekends. In saying that, the volume of Buddhists going up simply highlighted just how sacred Adams Peak is. Loads of food, tea & water shops all the way along the track & toilets too - don’t overload yourself with carrying heavy water bottles - carry warm clothes instead.

Prepare your calves for some soreness!! However not gonna be a Debbie downer, the hike is done by children and elderly. So if they can do it you can do it! There are lots of shops alone the way, they got snacks and water and motivation to keep going! Also there’s lights along the track and toilets every 20min. You don’t have to wear hiking shoes; some people go with flip flops and some running shoes. I prefer running shoes or any comfy ones you own. We reached the top at 5:30am and sunrise started at 6:00am and trust me; the hike was worth the view. May the force be with you- enjoy!","January 5, 2018",0.0,0.0

Words can’t describe the feeling once you get up there and pictures can not do the view any justice. Would recommend doing it on a weekday as there isn’t so many people there. The locals told us that weekends are very very busy climbing up it! We are a pretty fit couple and there were times that did test us but the track has shop stalls along the way which offer seats to rest. I would recommend buying your water and snacks before hand as they do charge a fair bit more up the mountain.  (but as they should, they cart boxes of drinks and whatever else all the way up there over there heads) The trek took us roughly 3 hours with regular stops to rest the legs and a coffee break at one of the stalls. There is regular police and medical posts along the way also! The hardest part of the trek would be the last 500 meters which does get pretty steep, but there is no shame in taking it slowly and moving to one side to get the jelly legs going again. Once at the top, the police let you know that it can get very busy and to keep your belongings on you and in your site at all times. We took a go pro and an expensive camera up and had no problems with anyone being suspicious or anything like that so I think that is just a standard warning. The best place to view the sunset is at the viewing deck to the left of the stairs as you arrive, get a good spot as it packed out while we were there and you don’t want to miss the sunrise (no words to explain it) It is very very cold once you stop hiking and relax to wait for the sun rise, so definitely take some warm clothes/gloves whatever else you need (there’s friendly and cheap shops in town if you didn’t bring any) The climb down is a breeze, once you get all the blood back into your legs. There was a few stacks down the stairs (including myself lol) but nothing to major. The sun has came out and the view down the mountain is visible and breath taking! We were blessed by a monk on the way down which was an awesome experience. We highly recommend you do NOT miss out this. It’s scary to look up at it and think “that looks friggen impossible.” But it is easier than it looks and you won’t regret it ! Enjoy.","January 3, 2018",0.0,0.0

The trek is a tough one, but doable and totally worth it. ANYONE can do it, you just have to start early, have water and chocolate/candy for energy, take breaks when required.... n you should be up there in no time. We started at 2AM and we reached the top by 5AM to witness the sunrise a little before 6AM. The views are spectacular and one of the best sunrises we have witnessed. You don't need a guide, no payment either.... its FREE. There are monks at various points asking for donation, just give them a friendly smile and ignore/avoid them politely. The top stairs have railing so that helps the final part and you might not need the trekking sticks. We didn't get any and we were fine. But you do need a torch or headlamp. Our guesthouse lend us a torch and that was very helpful, they also told us that we dont need to rent a trekking stick either. We stayed in Queensark which was 200 meters away from the start. You can also stay in Grand Adams Peak, Vegetable Garden, Slightly Chilled Guesthouse and Restaurant... these are within the same distance from the starting point which is approx. 200 meters. You start at 2AM and take frequent breaks. Make sure you have plenty of water and chocolate/candy/sugary stuff to get energy. There is a tea stall almost 500 meters before the top, and you can get Sri Lankan break and tea to get carbs n sugar. Its 3 hours to go up and 2 hours to come down. We spent 1 hour enjoying the sunrise and the surrounding natural beauty. Starting at night is better cuz during the day it get pretty hot and hence, it gets harder to get up. Plus, there will be atleast 40-50 climbers with you anyways, so that helps to get up as well. Important: The trek is FREE, but there will be LOTS of monks on the way who will ask for donation (MONEY). You don't have to register your name anywhere either. You can see them from a distance, and when you see them, keep a distance, have a friendly smile when they say hi, and politely wave, say thanks n keep walking fast. They are friendly, n wont insist, so its easy to avoid them.","January 2, 2018",0.0,0.0

We took 3 hours and 15 minutes to get up and 2 hours and 15 minutes to get down. There were others who were much faster with the descent, but this is all we managed with our fitness levels. The town to go to trek this place is called Nallathaniya. Book a place which is in the town so you are close to the base. You will be regretful especially when it's done and your muscles are sore. The town has not much else so plan to leave right after the trek. We headed to Nuwara Eliya but Ella isn't too far either. The nearest bus stand is Hatton which is connected by rail as well. We stayed at a place called Ayos Hill Adam's Peak which arranges transportation to the base camp but over all, the location was way too far from the base (almost 4 kms). The peak in itself has not much to offer except the view of the sunrise unless you are the religious type. Get up there and perch yourself on one of the steps on top to get a good view. It's tough but not impossible so do not be scared of the challenge. You can buy water along the way as there will be lot of eateries selling tea/snacks etc. Carry some fruits like banana with you which is the best food option while trekking.

That way you can start the walk/climb directly from the hotel and avoid needing to arrange transport. We started out from the hotel at 2am which was perfect. We were ahead of the masses although there were definitely many other walkers at the same time. Don't worry if you are on your own as there are so many people on the walk. The start of the climb is easy with a gradual incline. There are parts of the track that are not as well lit as others and we did use the flashlight on our phones to see the way - but mostly the track is well lit. The climb gets gradually tougher on the way up and the last section is the hardest with steep narrow steps but there is a railing which does help a lot. The climb took us around two and a half hours with a few short stops along the way. to catch our breath. There are small stalls along the way if you want to but water, drinks or snacks. There are also local toilets along the way as well. There were a lot of people the morning we climbed to the top which created a ""traffic jam"" near the top. When we reached the very top it was crowded. It is best to find a spot to sit out of the wind and wait for the sunrise. Do take something warm with you as it is chilly. I thought a thin sweater would be fine but I was shivering. A warmer covering would have been much better. Once the light starts to break through everyone is standing with cameras and many  jostling for the best vantage spot. I would recommend moving down from the top a little and getting a better spot with uninterrupted views where you can enjoy the moment. The walk back down Adam's Peak was much easier and took about two hours. The scenery on the walk down is breathtaking and the misty clouds add to the experience. Although the calf muscles were sore the next day it was well worth the climb in this beautiful part of Sri Lanka. Do it!","December 29, 2017",0.0,0.0

The weather wasn't perfect but we still wanted to give it a go. We encountered two monks on our walk up, sitting below temples. The first monk told us we must enter our names in the log book and make a donation. He showed us the book and said everyone pays 1000 rupees per person. We had not expected to need money for the hike and had only brought small change with us (nor were we in a position to donate such an amount). We wrote our names and explained that all we had on us was about 200 rupees, at which the monk expressed his disappointment and told us not to fill in the ""amount"" column (he presumably did it after we left to make sure a high amount was entered, so future tourists would not try to match our small donation). The monk at the second temple stopped us as well, but said ""No donation necessary, sign only"". We were relived because we had given all our money to the first monk. However after we signed our names the monk asked for a donation - We explained we had no money left. He then angrily crossed our names out of the log book and waved us away! Based on the number of entries were saw for the date we hiked and the number of people that were at the summit, not everyone had written in the log books / given a donation, but when you approach the monks alone (there was no one else around us at those points), they insist that you must enter your name and pay. But it's totally your choice! A guide is not necessary, the path is all concreted and clear, and there are plenty of people on the track.","October 17, 2017",0.0,0.0

But I decided to go simply because the Peak Wilderness Sanctuary is a part of UNESCO Heritage Site (which I'm collecting) and set it as a goal to reach the top. We started off late at 4am expecting not to see the sunrise because we saw the peak was surrounded by cloud the day before and knew that there won't be any sunrise. We also started light only with our rain jackets, a bottle of of water that we barely drink due to the rain, and our smartphone as torchlight as there's no light on the road. We spot no animals on the way but heard a lot of frogs croaking from the bushes. It was raining and foggy. Our sport shoes got wet quickly but it didn't affect much of the ascent. The climb was not so hard as there are proper stairs either made of rocks or concrete. When we're half way up we already saw some hikers coming down. We've been told there's no sunrise and the temple is locked. It didn't bother us much as we already knew that and our main goal was just to reach the top. We arrived at the top at around 7:30am and found it really foggy, and the temple was closed. While we're taking photos from the gap of the gate, a man from the shelter opened the door and told us it's off season and it's closed. We replied with smiles and he went back to the shelter. Surprisingly with a minute or two he opened the door and came up to the temple with his jacket on. He opened the side entrance and told us to take off our shoes and enter. We were shocked but followed his lead to the site where the ""footprint"" was situated. There's a door locked but you could peek into it from bottom. It's just amazing to get to see the real thing in front of our eyes, after so many people had told us that the temple was closed, nothing to see and asked us to turn back! It's just unbelievable! We gave some donation before we left. There's some other donation in the bowl (which was not wet) and we knew that we're not the only lucky ones. We went down with great joyfulness because we had accomplished our goal, seeing the unexpected and starting to see the greenery of the forest in the mist. The trees were really beautiful in the mist, just like in fairy tales. And the tea valley and waterfalls at the bottom of the mountain was a bonus to the hike. To conclude, it's not easy to reach the top as it takes hours to reach the top and not easy while raining, but as long as you're optimistic who knows what's waiting for you ahead. Just go for it! It's definitely something memorable, at least your legs soreness will remind you for a few days, but it's worth it.","September 2, 2017",0.0,0.0

It is not an easy climb and we saw many people who were really struggling along the way. There are supposed to be around 5500 steps and it gets quite steep at times. The view of the sunrise is very beautiful from the peak and this is the reason most people  start climbing at night. We started climbing at 2:00AM and were able to reach the top at 4:45AM. This meant we had to wait in the cold weather for more than an hour before sunrise (around 6AM); but this wasnt so bad as it gave us some time to catch our breath and also meet many of the others who had come from different parts of the world. We made friends with a group of Chinese youngsters, one of whom was celebrating her birthday. We cut a cake and sang for her :) The sunrise itself was really beautiful and the view of the valley from the peak is amazing. We spent about half an hour just soaking it all up and taking pics.

We climbed as a group of 3 on a Saturday, starting our ascent at 1:30am and reaching the summit at 4:30am We did have a look at other reviews/discussions from this time of year and noted a few things that were mentioned, which I have covered below. Animals: We did not see any wildlife on our climb, although as the first climbers of the day we were followed up by 2 dogs (one of which was at the bottom starting the climb with another group as we came back down). However, the climb is very eerie in the dark and when visibility is particularly poor I would suggest a group of 3 or more is best for a night climb Lighting: As has been mentioned on here the climb is not lit all year round, despite what some guide books say. If climbing at night I would recommend using head torches, as due to the gradient of the climb at some points it would be best to have both hands free. Neither of our 3 torches ran low on batteries during the climb, but it's probably worth taking at least one spare set. The climb: The start of the climb is pretty poor, with around 1km of shacks that are used as shops in the peak season. The climb itself is varied but the gradient generally increases as you move up the mountain. It was hard work but if you take your time it is very doable. No shops were open past the start of the climb. The weather: The weather was awful. We had spent 2 weeks in Galle and Colombo and despite the weather saying rain all day every day we had about 10 minutes of rain up to this point in the trip. It turns out the weather for hill country is spot on. From the minute we arrived until we left 2 nights later it was chucking it down. We were wearing goretex full waterproofs (jacket and trousers) and waterproof walking boots and within the first 30mins-1hr we were completely drenched and had to change at the top. On the way down I wore a poncho and found it was very good at keeping me dry and cool. The summit: A complete waste of time in the off season. We reached the top at around 4:30 and found it was completely deserted. It is a quite built up concrete area with no where to sit or take shelter. The footprint itself is on the very peak and is closed at this time of year, surrounded by a wall. Eventually a man who heard us came out and told us it would be closed until December, but offered tea for 100lkr. We decided to wait until sunrise at 6am, with around 30 European tourists arriving at the top in this time, all very disappointed that it was closed, with some heading straight back down before sunrise. Despite our hopes the rain persisted and all we could see of the sunrise was a blue colour to the clouds. The descent: We heard the descent had the best views, but again due to the weather we saw absolutely nothing until we reached the very bottom, where we had a beautiful view of the valley. Overall, I would suggest not attempting the climb during July or August unless there is a patch of clear weather, as the reward from achieving the climb itself is simply not worth it. The attached photo is our view from the summit at sunrise.","August 13, 2017",0.0,0.0

Weather was drizzly when we arrived and progressively got worse through the night. We set the alarm for 1.30am and decided if it was very heavy rain we would not do the climb. As luck would have it there was only a fine misty drizzle and off we set at 1.55 am. Didn't  see any one else until after the half way point. This is by no means an easy climb. We are in our early 50's and have  a reasonable standard of fitness .We passed several others who would have been half our age who were having real difficulty .Made it to the top in 2 hrs 35 minutes with lots of short rest stops along the way and would have been in the first 10 to arrive. Only saw one shop open on the way up and the vendor advised us we were at the 3 km mark. The last section of the climb is particularly challenging with very steep steps which seem to go on for ever. I relied heavily on the handrails on each side to haul myself up. Weather steadily got worse and we encountered heavy rain and howling winds. Was very cold at the top and very obvious there would be no amazing sunrise ( only cloud and mist) as a reward for our efforts so we only stayed long enough at the top to get  a few photos and to put a merino clothing layer on. Others seemed quite happy to stay up there. The trip down took far longer than I thought it would - 2 hours 15 even though we hardly stopped. Feeling  the effects 1 day later in the calf muscles but no regrets. My tips would be: 1. Be prepared with a good head torch- we brought them from home. It would have been so much harder to have to hold a hand torch. We saw others just using flashlight function from their iPhone and others foolishly enough with no light. The walk is hard enough without not being able to see where you are going 2.  Wear sensible shoes and carry some thermal layers to put on when you get to the top especially if it is raining 3.  A good rain jacket is essential - the thin rain ponchos others had on were no match for the very windy and wet  conditions. We even saw several carrying umbrellas!! 4. No need to pack heaps of food and water. A few snacks and bananas and just enough water to get you through. We used a litre between the 2 of us. 5 . No need to hire a guide although I wouldn't like to do it on your own 6. Make sure you take the same track down (Hatton Road) otherwise it will add hours to your hike back In summary it is still a must do even for no sunrise  and views purely for the sense of achievement. Completing it in the dark adds to the thrill and adventure. In summary really please,"August 6, 2017",0.0,0.0

Then I easily took a bus to Maskeliya. From there, I took a tuk tuk to Dalhousie. Dalhousie is a town full of hotels that most tourists use for the climb. The reason I took the bus to Maskeliya is to decrease the cost. I'm on a budget. The tuk tuk drivers wanted around 1500 rupee from Hatton to Dalhousie. I paid about 500 for just Maskeliya to Dalhousie (half of the trip). It's nice joining the locals on the bus. The bus ride was very fun as the driver furiously rushed up the mountain. I got to my hotel and all the guests were brought together in order for the hotel staff to go over key points about the climb. I'm guessing a lot of hotels do the same thing. Anything you need for the climb can be bought or rented at your hotel. The one thing I really suggest you bring is a strong and long-lasting headlight or flashlight. The one I rented from my hotel was extremely weak. They referred to it as a torch. My iPhone light is much stronger than this rented torch. I got up at 1:40am and started walking out the door at 1:55am. Along the way, I met a group of people who also wanted to reach the top of Adam's peak. In fact, I never felt alone going up even with my weak torch because there were so many people trying to accomplish the same thing as me - to see the sunrise at the top. It was raining, but my hotel loaned me a rain poncho. The hike was hard for me, especially since I'm out of shape. There were closed shops to the top because it's off-season. I made it to the top within 2.5 hours with frequent breaks. It was all clouds and fog when I got to the top. A guy was selling delicious tea at the top for 100 rupee per cup. The temple was closed and nobody was around to open the gate to the temple by sunrise so we all left. Took 2.5 hours getting down, which is much harder as the knees take on a lot of pressure of your weight. Going down felt longer as well because I could see where I'm going as opposed to going up in the dark where I'm focused on each step. Recommendation for a 2am journey: - climb during in-season because off-season does not have favorable odds of seeing a clear view - bring a strong, long-lasting flashlight - be prepared to change into dry clothes at the top because you're sweaty at the top with the clothes you wear and it will get cold once your body cools off from the hike and the wind blows hard up there (feels colder if it's raining) - prep as you would for a hike","August 3, 2017",0.0,0.0

Everything we read recommended going up at 2/2:30 am and said it would take roughly three hours to climb. We woke up at this time to find it pouring with rain so left it until the morning and started at 11am. The sky was completely clear by then so we got much better views than the people we spoke to who had gone at night. The climb is very tough so pack a lot of water and snacks. Ask the locals about the forecast because by the time we got to the top the clouds were covering any views. Great sense of achievement though and definitely a must do in Sri Lanka.

The descent was no easy task either, the climb took all our legs and left us with little to handle the 2.5hr journey down. It is not a technical climb at all, just thousands of unevenly laid steps. Unless you know for sure your legs are in good shape, please give yourself 3-4 hrs for the climb. Be aware that chances of seeing the sun rise are low during off season, we were surrounded by rain and fog/clouds the whole time up there (see photo attached).

Pros- No crowds to battle, very peaceful hike. Pretty rewarding to conquer a mountain :) Cons- unfortunately we didn't see the sunrise due to the fog layer Tips (from a 30yr old)- > I'm a personal trainer by profession and thought it was challenging. I made it up in 2hrs at a good pace without stopping. I would say the average person will take closer to 3hrs, and I'd budget 4hrs if you do not exercise. > Don't forget to stretch before, during and after! Your body will thank you. >Headlamps are 100% necessary if you're trying to be there for sunrise. >Have a food & water plan! Not much is open at 2-3am during off season so be sure to get water and food the night before and pack it for energy the day of the hike. > Bring layers, the top can be wet, windy and cold. >You have to pass through a temple on the way- they record your name, country of origin, and donation amount.

The footprint at the top is a must see although please make sure to remove your shoes as a mark of respect. The signs for this are not very obvious.

The hike is challenging but a fun exercise. Expect SORE legs! TIPS: Expect a couple of stray dogs to follow you ALL the way to the top! Expect them to get in fight with other stray dogs over who gets to follow you. There is NO open shops so bring your own food and water! There is NO light so bring a reliable flashlight.

Make sure you have an early night the night before, I think we were asleep by 8:00pm. We woke up at 2:00am in the pitch black to start the journey. I'm not going to lie, the climb is tough. My partner and I are very fit people and we were huffing and puffing and sweating throughout. Although everyone walks at their own pace and wakes up at a time that will give them enough time to reach the top. We reached the top at 5:00am. There are lots of pit stops and tucker shops along the way to buy water and snacks. Food and drink gets more expensive the higher you get as the locals have to walk all the supplies up the hill themselves.The path is made up of concrete steps and is very well lit the whole way with street lamp style lights. Although the climb may seem hard, it is sooo worth it when you reach the top. The view is incredible. Everyone is silent as you watch the sun rise - I've never experienced anything so sureal. The descent was alot faster than the actual climb. We were down in under 2 hours. Everyone then has a big BIG breakfast - which feels very well deserved. Tips: 1. Bring a backpack with water and sugary snacks for energy. 2. Bring a jacket, beanie and gloves. The higher you get, the colder it gets. Sitting up the top is FREEZING - trust me! 3. People recommend hiring and paying for a guide 'tracker'. I would advise AGAINST this. Its very unnecessary as the path is very clear and well lit throughout. 4. Watch you're legs on the way down - they will be jelly! There are eldery monks and children as young as 5 or 6 that do this climb. Do not let people scare you into doing it. If you take you're time, pace your self and take breaks at the designated rest stops - you will be fine. It is a once in a life time experience and I would highly recommend it.

Please be aware that the season ends on 10th May, which means that all the lights leading the way will be switched off, so ensure you take a torch or headlamp to find your way up if you are planning a sunrise climb. We set off from our hotel (Hugging clouds - near the start of the route) at 2:30am, and were soon blessed by some friendly monks at the temple near the base of the mountain (we gave a 1000 rupee donation but no pressure is applied so feel free to give as much or little as you wish). There are a couple of forks in the route near the start, however both options always seem to join back together after a few hundred meters. The first hour walk is very enjoyable, sections of steps followed by small sections of flat, there were shops and cafes selling food and drinks so we didn't need to worry about carrying much water with us (not completely sure if these are still open out of season). We travelled quite lightly, just a small backpack with a jumper, extra layers & vegtable rottis. After the first hour the trail gets a little tougher, with longer sections of steeper steps, however there are still some rest points if you need a short break. The route wasn't too crowded when we visited and so we were able to go at our own pace. We reached the top just before 4:30am and entered the temple area (the temple area covers the whole peak, so unless you go into the temple you'll have to descend the mountain slightly to wait for sunrise). You are required to remove your shoes to enter and I would advise to layer up straight away- you quickly get cold at the top once your sweat cools! We waiting for just over an hour and we were able to enjoy a picturesque sunrise, illuminating the clouds over the lake and the nearby valleys. We didn't stay at the top long, but instead started walking down, to see the sunrise at various other secluded parts of the trail. It took around two hours to walk back down and the views were lovely. We tried to do a few stretches when we got back to the hotel, to lessen the ache the next day. If you are relatively fit, then maybe set off around 3am from the base of the mountain, to limit your time in the cold waiting for the sunrise at the top. Alternatively, set off earlier and have a rest or two on the way up. As long as you go at your own steady pace, most people should be able to complete this climb (we saw very elderly people, children & people in jeans and flip flops make it to the top - impressive)! If you are climbing adam's peak for sunrise you will probably want to stay at Dalhousie/Nallathanniya the night before - there are plenty of hotels to chose from near the base of the mountain. To get here from Kandy or Ella you need to catch the train to Hatton (around three hours from either of those starting points), then catch the bus from Hatton to Dalhousie (another hour and a half). Or you should catch a tuktuk or taxi from Hatton if you don't fancy the bus. Try set off earlish if you can, so you can enjoy an early dinner & an early night.

This had been the trip I was most looking forward to prior to coming to Sri Lanka, but ended up being about the worst. The group that had gone up the night before had not made it to the top before sunrise so we left at midnight to ensure we would make it (which I was dubious about, but didn't have a choice). Making your way to the top was an interesting experience. There are so many people to say what time of night it is, with little shops at the beginning and at various points on the way up. The lights towards the top look lovely as you climb, but that is about it for the walk up. As you get closer to the top it gets more and more crowded, to the point where you are being pushed around at times. There are people sleeping everywhere making it difficult to climb at points and you are also dodging running stretcher carriers at times as they career down the mountain with collapsed people. Once at the top, there is a small temple which you literally are crushed by people to get into, then there is nothing else. We arrived at 3am so had to sit on the top of the mountain in the cold for 3 hours waiting for sunrise. The actual sunrise was quite spectacular, but the amount of people detracts from the whole experience to the point where it completely lost its magic. You then need to leave the top immediately to avoid the worst of the crowd, but you are literally crushed trying to get down. Our guide then wanted to rush us down the mountain to avoid the crowds so I had to lag behind to take in the stunning views of being up above the clouds and seeing the peaks shadow on them. On the way down reality really hits with rubbish everywhere and I was left with a feeling of sadness that such a hugely significant religious site could be treated like crap.","May 10, 2017",0.0,0.0

It is Buddhism everywhere, not necessarily a complaint from me but information. If you do not see value in Buddhism or think of it as idol worship it will be bothersome to you. The route, for being a pilgrimage, is extremely non serene. It is full of vendors all the way up, not meditation stops but normal kades selling tea, soda, rotis. Some are playing radio stations. There is supposed to be no smoking or drinking, signs along the way give the instruction, but it still takes place. There are also signs to keep nature clean, love mother nature and so forth but the place it literally lined with trash and rubbish. There are toilets to use for a small fee along the way, but some decide to use the side of the path, which adds to the smell. I will say I was a bit surprised at the level of defilement in an area that is so often spoken of as a revered site. But I guess each has their idea of reverence. The walk up is 5k. The first 2k are relatively easy with only slight incline. The 3rd and 4th gets a bit more challenging.  The final kilometer is a killer, heading at a very steep incline, but it's only 5k, not too bad. The difficult part is the decent. This whole thing is concrete, mostly steps, over 5000 of them. That is killer on the knees, calves, thights, feet coming down. I would not do this again for a number of reasons.","May 10, 2017",0.0,0.0

I was nervous about this climb, even considering abandoning it, and probably did far too much research about it, (some of it unhelpful) but figured we could always turn back if we had to. My advice is to DO IT! We departed our bungalow at 1am for the 1hr drive to Dalhousie. From there we started the walk, gentle at first, before the stairs begin in earnest! The middle section is quite gruelling with long flights of uneven stairs, but then the stairs become less steep for the final 1/3, with the final steep ascent divided by a rail into up and down sections. This section was a little crowded and the pace slows down, which is actually a good thing! It is cold at the top, so be prepared for that. Bright lights mar the sunrise somewhat, but the atmosphere is really exciting. Be sure to check out the west just after sunrise to see the weird pyramid shadow cast by the mountain. This was more spectacular than the sunrise. Don't rush down thinking it will be a bottleneck of people. It wasn't. Just a slow steady walk down; crowded at first but soon easing off beyond the place where you replace your shoes. What to take: A walking pole is such a saviour, but you only need one as there are often rails on one side; a beanie is essential, a fleece for the top and if you have bad knees a dose of anti-inflammatory before you leave. Either the walking pole or the anti inflammatories or both left me with no knee or any other pain during or after this walk, when I have suffered greatly on far easier climbs. Toilets are everywhere and are simple and clean enough for 20R. We took 2 small water bottles which was enough, but you can buy more along the way. Climbing at night means you don't get as thirsty. I would never attempt this during the day. It took us 2 1/2 hrs to get up, we spent 1 1/2 at the top and 2 1/2 to get back down. Ate only a small banana and a biscuit on the climb and returned for a huge breakfast at our accommodation. I can't recommend this highly enough...a surreal experience.","May 8, 2017",0.0,0.0

The final 10% of the way was just a stationary line of 1000s of people, leading all the way to the top.

If you intend to walk up Adams peak at this time of the year I would recommend starting out even earlier, purely to try and miss all of the crowds.

After seeing the footprint there is nothing more to see before the sunrise. So i reccomend waiting as long as you can before starting the hike. So you get less waiting time at the top (it gets cold). Due to the huge amount of people leaving after sunrise it gets caothic. But if you have the time, dont mind the cold and like an adventure this trip is Nice.","April 24, 2017",0.0,0.0

The steps became very steep at the end and legs were hurting, but we made it before sunrise.

It is 5500 steps and not easy by any means.  However, unless is it mega busy, you can certainly take your time and have a few stops on the way.  If I was to do it again, I would take more steps as my legs were very sore for a few days after and rather wobbly on the climb down!

Wrong. There were thousands. And I mean thousands of Sri Lankans also make the trek. Unfortunately (or fortunately) we had chosen the last Sunday of the season to see Sri Prada, and many of the country locals were there to worship. We made it to the top by 430am, but only because our guide took us on a short cut that avoided an extraordinarily long line on another path to the top. The crushing crowd at the top made the sunrise a bit difficult to enjoy, but it was very moving to see so many Sri Lankans so determined to practice their faith; many barefooted old women climbed the long narrow stairs to the top to praise Buddha. In retrospect, my wife and I were glad to be a part of the Sri Lankan community on top of the peak, but if you don't have a taste for crowds, best to climb Adam's peak during with week, or in the off season (after March 31), when ONLY tourists make the trek. Wear good walking shoes and be prepared for a good workout! Also, if you do the trip at night, bring a dry piece of clothing to change into, and something warm, because it can get cold waiting for the sun to rise.","April 13, 2017",0.0,0.0

If you like adventure, and a bit of a challenge: YES, it's rewarding and can be fun. If climbing ten flights of stairs leaves you begging for the sweet release of death, this is not the best of ideas. Here are some practical tips for those looking to climb Adam's Peak. WHEN TO CLIMB: In terms of weather, the best time of the year is from December to April. However, this also coincides with the pilgrimage season, which means there will be many people climbing the mountain with you. We climbed in mid-March; while there were quite a few pilgrims, it wasn't too bad. Avoid climbing on weekends, full moon (poya) days, and at the time of the Sinhalese New year (mid-April), as it will be more crowded on these days. If you wish to avoid crowds altogether, climb during the off-season, but be very mindful of the weather. It's probably best not to climb if it's rainy. In terms of time of day, you have two options again. I recommend a night-to-dawn climb, reaching the peak in time for the sunrise. Check sunrise time on the day of the climb, and begin your ascent accordingly, so that you have enough time to get to the top before sunrise. You can also choose to climb during the day, in which case bring along a hat, sunglasses and sunblock, for the sun can be quite strong. WHICH ROUTE TO TAKE: The Ratnapura route is longer. The Dalhousie route is shorter but steeper. We stayed in Maskeliya (a quiet, pretty town), and arranged for a van to pick us up at 2am on the day of the climb, to take us to Dalhousie. WHAT TO TAKE WITH YOU: Travel as light as possible because you'll regret any excess weight. Definitely carry a light jacket, especially if you're climbing before dawn: you may be sweating profusely during the climb, but it can get very windy and chilly at the peak. Consider dressing in layers. Check temperature/weather prediction before your climb, and carry rainwear if necessary. If you're climbing during pilgrimage season, there will be plenty of stalls along the entire route, selling everything from tea to RedBull, from chips to meals (all at a premium, naturally). You will not need a torch because the path will be well lit. There are quite a few small, dirty, pay-and-use toilets (charging anything from LKR 10-40; carry small-denomination notes). Take your camera: once the sun comes up, you'll be treated to some very beautiful views. Sunglasses may also be a good idea. If you're climbing off-season, it might be prudent to carry snacks (energy bars, bananas), water (electrolytes) and a torch. There are plenty of waste-bins along the route (and yet, people still litter the mountain). HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE? (These estimates are for the Dalhousie route.) If you're fit, it might take you 2 hours (inclusive of short breaks). Don't run up the mountain, though: enjoy the journey. If you're not fit, it might take you 3 to 3.5 hours, and your legs will curse you for the next few days. (Don't plan any strenuous activity immediately after the climb.) Climbing down won't be any faster if you're doing this during pilgrimage season because there will be plenty of people descending along with you. Regardless of fitness level, it's not a good idea to rush down a steep mountain: your knees will take a hit, and that will screw up the rest of your Sri Lanka trip. Set aside at least 7 hours in total for the entire trip from the base of the mountain to the top and back to the base. Include some time to relax at the top and reflect on your achievement. If you're climbing from Ratnapura, remember that it will take a bit longer. WHAT ELSE TO EXPECT: Towards the top, it might seem as if the steps never end. Just when you begin to believe you've made it to the peak, the mountain mocks you with the sight of more steps to climb, steeper than before. Don't give up! Pilgrims of all ages climb the 5000+ steps to the top. You'll see elderly people supporting themselves on crutches, trudging on uncomplainingly. You'll see parents holding infants in their arms, singing hymns as they climb. OTHER TIPS: If you want to catch the best view of the sunrise from the very top of the mountain (and take great photos), you'll have to reach the peak with at least 30 minutes to spare, manoeuvre yourself into a good spot facing east (the Dalhousie side, not the Ratnapura side), and wait patiently in the semi-darkness as pilgrims and tourists jostle to greet the sun. The limited space at the top means that it will be very crowded at the peak during pilgrimage season. Once the sun is up, the pilgrims will head for the shrine, offer prayers and start their descent; wait for the crowd to thin a bit. (During off-season, you needn't reach too early.) To walk into the shrine at the very top of the peak, you'll have to take off your shoes. After seeing the sunrise, walk over to the Ratnapura side of the peak. From this spot, you'll be able to see the eerily near-perfect conical shadow cast by Adam's Peak onto the hills over which it towers. (You might need to climb down a few steps for the best view.) There are absolutely no entry fees. When you begin your climb, you may be cajoled into making a donation. If you don't wish to donate money, it's perfectly okay to smile and politely decline: no one will be offended. You will not need a guide: there are steps leading straight up, and any seeming detours lead to the same place eventually. Lastly, if you're not quite fit but still determined to make the climb, go with a friend: you might be quite miserable otherwise. Good luck!","April 11, 2017",0.0,0.0

You should absolutely do it.  Here are my tips for a good trip: 1. Avoid the crowds and climb during the week and not on a Poya day. 2. Allow 3 hours. We're pretty fit and it took us a bit less than 3 hours at a leisurely pace. 3. Plan to give yourself 30 mins at the top before sunrise. You can take a look around, ring the bell, have something to eat and position yourself for a good view to the east. 4. You won't need a torch in-season. The track is lit all the way. 5. Take warm pants and a hoodie for the top.  It gets pretty cold up there! 6. Take a spare tshirt. You'll be soaked in sweat by the time you get to the top. 7. Take sunnies for the trip down. 8. Don't plan any serious climbing the days after, your legs will be sore!","April 1, 2017",0.0,0.0

Take something warm to wear at the top waiting for the sunrise, it is windy and chilly but by Northern European standards not cold.  Decent walking shoes or trainers, torches (the path is unlit in places and the steps vary in steepness and frequency) and we all wore walking trousers for both respect and chill factor.  Avoid the loos if possible but do take on water.  We also had some energy bars that proved useful. Calves will ache for a few days after and a reasonable degree of fitness is required. Four of us (50yrs +) did the Sri Pada climb on 19 Mar 17 setting off from Punsisi Rest House at 01:30.  Our driver had arranged the services of a local guide which we thought may have been unnecessary as essentially it's a set of steps going up and then the same set down again, what could go wrong?  The start was relatively easy, a small amount of people going up and coming down again.  It got busier and busier but we were making good time.  After a few hours our guide stopped, met with his Dad who was guiding a group of German tourists and informed us we were going to take a different route.  Torches to the ready we left the path and plunged into the jungle, scrambling up embankments and through trees and shrubs in the pitch black eventually coming out of a rough stone strewn path which after some time eventually led out onto one of the other longer but less well used paths to the top.  It was still a real effort to the top and became increasingly crowded with a queue of people going up one abreast and a queue coming down, lots of people stopped or sleeping on the path.  Eventually reaching the temple at the top, removing shoes we were amongst hundreds of people, many coming up from the original path we had set out on.  Our guides insisted they knew of a better place to see the sunrise and we started descending to a place just off the peak where we saw the magnificent sunrise.  The queue by this time on the ascent was four or five deep and extended down and up as far as the eye could see.  On our way down (after 06:30) we were asked by a Western couple how far off the top they were, they had started at 01:00 but had been stuck in the queue now for hours and were still probably 3 to 4 hours off the top.  It was only by following our guide 'off piste' that we had managed to reach the peak at all, the amount of people trying to come up the normal path had to be seen to be believed - please AVOID WEEKENDS at all costs.","March 29, 2017",0.0,0.0

Whilst it seemed a little unnecessary, it was nice that they were keeping an eye out for us. Once at the top, we waited a while for the sunrise. It does get very busy, and once the top is full, it's closed off, so leave plenty of time to get there, and be prepared to wait (in the cold!) for the sunrise to appear. Beautiful views, especially on the way back down. It was a little cloudy, but for us, this didn't detract too much. There are shops and (predictably grim) toilets along the way, so if you don't bring snacks etc, you can pick them up on the way.

I was a solo female traveller and had done lots of research prior to the climb. I can confirm you definitely do NOT need a tour guide for Adams Peak. It's so well lit, and there's thousands of other people climbing it too so you'll never be alone. It was quite tough in parts of the climb and the way down is also hard as your knees are pretty knackered by that point but it's totally worth it! Also, it's definitely a climb for all ages, I saw small children to elderly people the whole way up so you don't have to be super fit! I stayed at Daddy's guest house which was great and easy waking distance to the start. I left Daddy's about 1:45am and began my climb at 2:00am (it's a little walk to the start from all the guest houses). It took me about 3.5 hours to get to the top but it would have been quicker if it wasn't for the crowds and queues during the last 1km. What I wore for the climb: - sports / gym leggings - Trainers (you don't need hiking boots, locals do it barefoot or in flip flops which is pretty mad) - T-shirt - Long sleeved zipper / hoody At different points on the way up I got hot and and then cold but I'd say the majority of the time I had my long sleeve zipper round my waist. However you definitely need it at the top as it's much cooler and quite windy. Also, due to the crowds the climb is much slower closer to the top so you can often find yourself queuing and not moving for 5-10 mins. What to take for the climb: - A small / medium sized rucksack (sports type one) - Drinks & snacks - a bottle of water (I put some berocca in mine) and a coke (you'll need some sugar hits along the way). A packet of sweets & choc bar- I bought the drinks & sweets in the main town before the climb as it's cheaper but you can get drinks and snacks the entire way up, they are just more expensive. - Toilet roll - Phone / camera (obvs!) - A portable phone charger (you don't want your battery running out when you get to the top!) - Hand Sanitiser - Sun glasses & suncream (for the way down) -  A spare top (in case it rains) I was very lucky and saw the sunrise as it was a clear morning and I also had the perfect weather conditions as it didn't rain!  The sunrise & view was absolutely beautiful and I've never seen anything quite like it. I climbed it on a Friday morning which I knew would be busy but it wasn't too bad apart from the last 1km to the top which I did have to queue quite a bit. Try and avoid weekends if your itinerary allows it. I can't recommend doing this climb enough, you don't have to be super fit, you can take your time, there are plenty of stop off points along the way. Definitely one of my favourite parts of my Sri Lanka adventure.","March 20, 2017",0.0,0.0

It is a really exhausting way up (over 5000 steps, which are all of different height and length. Some passages are really steep.) but it is definitely doable. We started at 2 am (at our guest house) and were at the top at 4:44am - sunrise was at around 6:20am... We had light rain the whole night. At first we thought we were dressed to warm but when you got near the top it got very cold and windy! (Especially if it is raining a bit). We wore a light jacket and a rain jacket over it. At the top we also wrapped us in the blanket we brought with us and were still freezing (over an hour in wet and windy environment isn't nice -.-). A lot of people were really poorly dressed (some in shorts and tank tops!?) And left before the sunrise since it was simply too cold... It also seems like locals go up there even earlier - with their flip-flops, on socks or even barefoot :-O A lot of them coming down the hill when you were climbing up and some were really really exhausted. In the end it was worth the way up and walking in the cold! The view was stunning even if it wasn't the glowing red sunrise you saw in many pictures (since it was cloudy and a bit rainy). Also to take pictures was hard since you are standing on steps side by side with lots of other tourists and locals - can't use a tripod (which would be useful in the low light) and there's a building which you have to overlook to see the sunrise! We didn't enter the temple since you should take off your shoes as usual - what we didn't wanted to do in that bad weather (even when some tourists and even locals entered with shoes on)... ...So take warm clothes with you (and maybe a fresh shirt to switch at the top!) and enjoy the view! We were there on a Monday. Weekends and on puja days it seem to be very very crowded (and you get stuck in ""traffic"" in the last hundreds of meters/steps without moving at all) so rather get there during the week. Also it is free of charge. At the bottom they want to tie route you through a small ""temple"" area where they want to persuade you to donate.

We had planned to watch the sunrise from the top but it was so busy it felt like a penn as it's all walled with thick rails on top of the wall, if your standing against them it would be fine but if not it might be hard to see...so we climbed a few steps down and watched it from there & had a fantastic view. There wasn't a lot of clouds around so the sunrise & view was amazing, deffinatley worth climbing up all the steps! The walk down seemed easy at first but after a while of bounding down the stairs my legs and especially my knees were aching! I wouldn't say the way down is harder but it does hurt the knees a quite a bit... It's been a couple of days and the leg wobbles have finally gone but calfs and knees are still quite sore! Still can't walk down stairs that easily at the moment! When we got the village at the bottom of Adams Peak before we started the climb we were very surprised (in a good way) at how busy it was, there are lots of guest houses, restaurants etc and loads of stalls selling everything you need for the climb, rainmacks, jumpers, trousers etc. Overall very hard work, not as fit as I thought but worth it, amazing views and a great experience!","March 15, 2017",0.0,0.0

It took my wife and I 4and a half hours to climb and 2and a half down with plenty of stops . The path is lit all the way up from November to April when climbing stops due to season. A small torch may be useful for some shadowy steps. There are stalls with water , hot and cold drinks and food at regular intervals all the way up. There are very basic toilets at regular intervals, cafes charge a small fee for use. The path is concrete steps all the way up . It starts wide about 4 metres with flat lengths and occasionally short flights, the second stretch is similar width with continuous steps of differing height, the last part is narrower with metal handrails to the top. We started at 2am in light shower and about 20 degree c . A light polyester base layer and light waterproof is enough. At the top it 10 degrees and a bit windy. I personally did not need another layer as it was like back home in Manchester Uk. There were no leeches as mentioned by another reviewer, you would need to go off the track into bush for this to be considered an issue. The length of climb is 7 kilometres each way plus a bit each way from your hotel . Our guide advised there are 5500 steps plus a vertical ascent of 1000 metres. As he said the village is at 1100 metres altitude, this maybe more like 1100 metres ascent. Don,t worry give it a go. The local pilgrims walking with no shoes or flip flops and singing their way up is inspirational. You will need to take off your shoes at the top and queue to visit the temple and impression of Buddas foot in the rock. The sunrise and mountain top vista are sensational.","March 9, 2017",0.0,0.0

So, this is our view, we are 2 55 year olds, I am a runner so very fit, my husband is averagely fit. 1. It is worth doing: if you like a challenge it ticks boxes; for the sunset if you are lucky enough to have a clear day, but for me the highlight was walking back down and taking in the scenery and views which were superb. 2. Age related/fitness related: I was fine on the uphill overtaking people far younger, but it does take its toll on the knees, so going down was harder. 3. Whatever fitness you can do it at your pace. Watching the locals, there are people carrying children up, very old men and ladies, so there is no excuse 4. When we climbed it was 60% Sri Lankans: 40% tourists, so that makes you think about the significance of the climb. 5. There are tea shops/toilets on the way, so there is no need to carry much other than a small bottle of water. I advise the Milo, a great treat before the final climb! 6. Clothes, we climbed in February, so cooler, it is warm ascending, it is slightly windy at the top so an extra layer is needed, going down the sun is up, so it is warmer. 7. Time it takes: we left around 2.30 and arrived at the summit about an hour too early for sunset. So with 2 stops, it is about 2.5 to 3 hours. If you are early, stop at the tea room and keep warm for a bit before the final climb. 8. It is busy at the top, if you stay outside the Temple, then get as high as you can on the steps, or stay in front of the temple somewhere on the climb up for a very clear view Consensual sigh as sun came up!!","March 5, 2017",0.0,0.0

There are plenty of stops along the way, we had a lot of sweets and fizzy drinks to keep us going, we took advantage of the stops too and rested our legs. The people climbing were so nice and even sang as walking up. The last part is steep and tougher on your legs, stairs all the way to the top. I know a lot of people go at 2am and reach top for sun rise, as we had young children we wasn't sure how well the lights on the stairs will be, on our way down it was dark yes, but you cAn see the steps, some parts didn't have light, but advise you to carry a mobile with light, or a torch light. But I have to say a lot more people where climbing in the evening so on top would have been a lot more busier. My husband didn't wait in a queue to see the footprint, he was in and out, its a lot more quieter. Avoid weekends and full moons. Ask your driver or hotel staff if it's any special day before you climb. As we are Muslim and I wear a headscarf, I realised with all the Buddhist temples in Sri Lanka that we visited I was not allowed in, I was asked to take off head scarf, but anyone with head covering had to take it off, you cannot wear a hat. So before the climb I knew that there is a 90% chance I maybe not allowed in the temple. I did walk right to the top and walk around the temple no one stopped me or said anything to me, people where really nice, but didn't enter the temple with the footprint. There are toilets along the way, on the way down my youngest needed to go, it's hole in the ground, and not well kept, but when we reached the bottom there are plenty of restaurants, we used the facilities in a restaurant and got food at the same time. We found a stall at the bottom of the peak free massage on legs, and they advertising a vapour rub, cost about 2usd for the rub they didn't force us to buy we felt bad after a free good massage (that we really needed) we brought out of courtesy and tipped the staff, they didn't want to take it. I noticed that at Adams Peak that the people, even the young kids serving behind the stalls where grateful and some didn't want to take any extra money.

For a reasonably healthy person, the climb up although not easy is very doable. The key thing is the pace yourself, depending on your fitness level and the state of your legs. There are many pits stop on the way up so finding a place to rest and refresh is not difficult. Most reviews talk about the spectacular sunrise, which it definitely was. However, for me, the journey up was an amazing experience in itself. I was struck by the little children who with their short legs found fun in making the arduous journey up, I was gently reminded of a parent's love seeing mothers and fathers carry their little children up the stairs despite their own tiredness and reminded of people's tenacity when I saw people 1.5x my age make this same journey up with me. Once up there, make your way into the temple grounds and soak in the Buddhist chants and spirituality of the place. It is not just a great site from which to witness and take pretty sunrise pictures. It is also a great place to just be with yourself and soak up the serenity of the place in the midst of all the chaos.

I was told it takes around 4 hours for the climb and another 3 to descent. We had a very limited time window considering our schedule here. We left from Bentota at 0300hrs in the Morning, reached Colombo at 0500hrs, from where we took a train to Hattan, reached Hattan at 1130hrs, took a bus to Nallathanniya and got to the base of the Peak at 1330 hrs,after finishing our Lunch, we started the Climb at 1400hrs. The view on the way up is Thrilling. but even when you're just a kilometer away the peak looks like it's too far. the stairs get steeper and tougher with every kilometer. On reaching the Summit,there wasn't much of a view, or maybe I was expecting too much. After spending some time at the summit, we started our descent at 1715 hrs  which we finished at 1820 hrs, Since we were planning to leave for Nuwara Eliya the same evening.there were no buses at that time, the only one would leave at 2130h rs, making our entire run useless.

Despite our early departure we still had to wait in the line 150m in altitude before the summit for 3 hours! Nonetheless, although we were not at the summit, we found a nice spot to watch the sun rise and it was amazing. This was one of the most beautiful moments in my entire life (and I have seen sunrises in the mountains before). The atmosphere was magic. However I think others were not so lucky as it is very important to start early enough to look out for a nice spot. You really don't want to stay in the crowd behind 3m tall bushes and see nothing when the sun shows up. Finally at the summit the spirituality of the monastery is exciting despite the crowds that make it a bit uncomfortable. Unlike most other people, we took all our luggage (backpacks) with us to go down on the other side to Ratnapura. The descent is 12000 stairs and took us 4.5 hours (including small breaks) so that we arrived at 3 pm in the valley, from where we took the 1 hour bus ride to Ratnapura.

We were there in good time to see the sunrise at a little after 6am. It was really tough and we were exhausted when we reached the top, but I am so glad we did it. Both of us ached for about three days afterwards. But neither of us are fitness freaks so it's not surprising we ached! A lovely experience walking up the mountain with many other pilgrims, most of whom are Sri Lankan's from all over the country. Its a very inspirational place and walking up the mountain enabled us to really experience local culture and to enjoy the beauty of the landscape from the top as the sun comes up. Many of the pilgrims are elderly or carrying their children to the summit to ask for a blessing from this holy place.

So raincoat, towel, a pair of spare sock, gloves, hiking stick (some hotels will have spares for lending) and warm clothes are highly recommended to be with you.  If you want to enter into the temple at the summit, you have to take off your shoes. We didn't follow the majority to start climbing at 2 am but 5 am so it was more easier to hike as the route was not crowded.  It took us 3 hours to the summit (first hour for the pretty flat steps while the last 2 hours for the steep stairs).  There are shops for hot food and drink on the route to the top so you can recharge your energy whenever it is necessary.  Don't forget to enjoy the awesome scenery on the way up or down.  Usually within 6 hours, you can complete the whole journey (for experienced and strong travelers, may be 1 to 1.5 hours less except during the peak hours in peak seasons). You can have meals 24 hours from the starting point so don't worry about where and when to have breakfast if you want to start climbing at 2 am (or even earlier).

I couldn't gauge the difficulty and wasn't sure I'd manage the climb. I arrived in Nallathaniya in the afternoon and started walking right away because it had stopped raining. I set out at 3.30pm and reached the top in two and a half hours - I stopped three times for five minute breaks. I managed to catch the last moments of sunrise. It took me two hours to descend. The climb was tough, but manageable. You can use the handrails at the top to help pull yourself up. As everyone says, walking back down is harder. It was dark when I descended and, although the path is lit, a torch made things easier. I walked alone and probably wouldn't do that again. There weren't many people around in the afternoon/evening, so I was alone for long stretches (a good and bad thing) and, as a woman, seemed to attract a lot of attention. Several locals stopped to check on me and whether I had anyone walking with me, they seemed to be concerned about my safety. There were also a couple of forks in the road on the way up and I needed to check I was on the right path. I met some lovely locals on the way up and down, there was a nice camaraderie despite there being so few people about. It does get cold at the top and you will sweat going up and down! You can buy food/water along the way. To give you an idea of my fitness level, I walk for 30 minutes, 5-7 days per week. A few weeks before I left for Sri Lanka, I started 'training' by walking up/down a mountain (approx 850m high) twice per day, everyday, for 10 days. I think this helped, but my legs are still a bit sore days after. This climb is special and I'm glad I did it. For me, it wasn't about the sunset (or sunrise), it was about the actual walk, the act of taking one more step every time it felt difficult. Is this a must-do? Probably not, but if you understand your motivation for doing it, I think you'll enjoy it.","January 30, 2017",0.0,0.0

As you must already know, it's quite the hike. It took us somewhere between 2-3 hours to summit, and nearly and equal amount of time to come back down. We were really underwhelmed by what we found when we arrived at the top. First of all, it was freezing cold and a bit windy at the top. Second of all, it was WAY too crowded. There were ""seats"" on a concrete wall that surrounds the temple on the very top of the mountain, but by the time the sun started coming up the police had everyone stand up so that more people could pack into the space. You get jammed in like sardines and watch the sunrise through a chain link fence. Essentially, if you're not a very tall person you'll just be watching the backs of the people in front of you, and if you can see over them, the view is marred by the dozens of cell phones everyone is waving all over taking pictures and videos for the entire hour the sun comes up. On top of it, at least the day we were these, the sunrise wasn't even pretty. There were a few streaks of pink and yellow, but it was mostly grey and drab and then just sunny. I've seen better sunrises driving to work in the morning at home.

It took 3 hours for me - my 17 year old mostly waited for me but could have made it in much less time. I didn't stop at a tea house as I was worried about getting to the top for sunrise but had multiple short breaks (sometimes every few steps!). We left at 1.10am from slightly chilled guest house. We were there in plenty of time. Others that left at 2am the day after Poya, Friday only got to the last tea house as it was too busy. I think it's not so much or just a slow moving queue but at the top it's actually a really small area so it's like it fils up and then the last (steep) flight of stairs also fills up and you cannot get forward. I am really pleased we had a great view of the sunrise from the peak after all that effort (truly spectacular) and were also able to get to the other side to see the shadow. Climbing on Poya was fantastic- there was such a sense of camaraderie. An older local lady stroked by arm (in friendship?) during a mutual pause in climbing and a young girl also grasped my hand as if to say we are nearly there! So so lovely. Yes on the way back in the daylight you can see some rubbish but they are really trying. We were handed a bag for rubbish! And there is the odd yuk smell. Don't let that put you off. The climb down whilst I initially such a relief to be going down not up is SO tough on the old knees after 10 mins (climbing down took me 2 hours). My legs hurt when squatting or walking up stairs or even getting up from a chair! for a few days despite stretching. So all in all it's no Sunday stroll and I wouldn't make it a regular thing but I was so pleased we did it! One thing we totally underestimated is ow very very cold it is at the top.

Oh, and perhaps the best spot to take a break is at the top right before you enter the peak, at the last available tea house. It's lively and they serve good tea. People huddle here before sunrise. No doubt you'll visit a few spots, though. Speaking of the top, I must say I'm a bit disssappinted. Not by the views (it was foggy so I can't comment). The layout of the temple is confusing, and with the rain and fog and wind and people flying around it makes the experience disorientating. Signs are everywhere asking you to take your shoes off, but locals and tourists alike seemed to be ok with leaving them on, perhaps on account of the rain. There was a gate leading to the temple top that was half closed for some reason, making people queue up unnecessarily.

There was no sunrise as it was foggy and clouds were thick. This only made the climbing of the steep steep stairs all the much worse, after the first steps we though they couldn't get worse, we were wrong- they only kept getting steeper and steeper to the point where you had to hold on to the rails for dear life for fear of falling backwards. By this stage the legs are killing, you are gasping for air and are desperate for water, but you don't want to drink for fear of using the toilets. (Bring toilet paper).

It is all steps on the way and although I would consider myself to be reasonably fit but found that this walk was difficult in parts. You need to leave in the middle of the night to be at the top for sunrise and unless you are staying nearby it is a long drive from Kandy, for example, and the roads are bumpy so there's not much chance of getting any sleep on the way. It is also very cold on the way up so make sure you bring warm clothes. If you don't have any packed then don't worry as you can buy cheap fleeces etc in the shops at the bottom. All that said this is a really different thing to do while you are on a holiday in Sri Lanka and it is so rewarding when you get to the top and then also when you get to the bottom and see how far you have walked (it is dark when you are climbing so you don't really get a sense for how high it is). It is so colourful and really interesting. There are lots of interesting religious sites on the way and tea stations where you can stop for a well deserved break. The sun rise is breathtaking. Try to time your walk so that you neither have to rush on the way up nor have to wait too long for sunrise when you are there near the top (as you will be cold and tired). This will depend on your fitness levels, how many tea breaks you want to take on the way and what time sunrise is at the time of the year. MAKE SURE YOU COME BACK DOWN THE WAY YOU CAME UP. There are two entrances/exits which will take you out different sides of the mountain so the last thing you need after a long trek is to be on your way back only to find you have to climb back up to the top to take the other exit!!!! Make sure you get a good rest before you do this and take time off to recover the next day.","January 13, 2017",0.0,0.0

Our hotel (blue sky guest house) was a 5-10 minute walk from the start of the official walk. The ascent took us 2.5 hours but we certainly could have taken our time and done it at more leisurely pace - we also know of people with little fitness who have woken at midnight to take their time on the way up and have plenty of breaks so that is a good option. There are dozens of tea houses on the way up to stop for food or drinks - though we didn't eat at any because it was too early. It is freezing at the top (and you can't wear shoes) so definitely have beanies, scarves, thick socks, thermals etc, but it gets so hot when you walk up so probably don't layer up at the bottom. There is no official cost to climb but monks will ask you for 1000 rupee as a donation at the bottom. The difficulty of the climb seems to have made the views even more spectacular. The entire top is a temple and it is hard to know in the dark where to go for sunrise, but people move around and you'll get a chance to get good views.

My husband and I did not care for that. Sunrises are sunrises and I didn't want to be cold and tired while doing this. We started the walk at 8am which was the best decision we made. As we were walking up loads of people were coming down. We did not find it too hot as a lot of the walk up is shaded from trees and there is a nice breeze to help with the sun. Because we started at 8am, we were pretty much the only ones going up and it was great. We could stop whenever we wanted, we never felt pressured to keep going or that we were in the way of others who can walk faster. The walk up is beautiful with great views. Once we got up to the top, it was slightly disappointing. The temple is built in a strange way that pretty much blocks your view. Because we were the only ones up at the top (since we did it at a different time than everyone else) we were able to freely walk around and find the best spots to get a great view. If you go at 2am with the crowds, you probably won't get a great view or the ideal spot to see the sunrise. If you don't care for sunrises, don't go at 2am with the crowds. Go after the sunrise and you will enjoy the hike and view much more. Also, don't think you will see the 'footprint', It is covered by the temple and be prepared to be sore for days after.","January 9, 2017",0.0,0.0

It was awesome but be prepared for a few days of pain to follow! In my option (my wife is yet to recover sufficiently to agree with me) this was our best experience in Sri Lanka, it is humbling to be walking alongside people taking part in a religious pilgrimage. Be prepared, the walk is harder than you think it will be! Over the full day we walked 6,500 steps this is the equivalent to; 4.2 times up and down the Empire State Building 10 times the number in the Eiffel Tower 17 times the number in Notre Damme Or 446 times up and down a floor in your home! Having said that it is amazing, it is a humbling experience to be part of. About 3/4 of the way up I was having a rest and got talking to a family of 2 in their mid  40s with kids ages about. 8 and 12 who I was telling them how hard work this was. They told me this was their second time and they had walked 70Km just to get to this point! Wow! Just wow! That put me in my place! The way is well lit during the main period but I wouldn't fancy doing it in the pitch black out of season. The climb goes from easy to bruitily hard by the end but there were usually people singing and very young children still running ahead of me which helps to keep you going. Sunrise is amazing as is the first 1000 steps or so in the light but after that the views are less good. If you can not get a place at the top take a seat on the stone steps near the summit which will give you a great view when the sun comes up. The walk down is hard work, stop often because you will get jelly legs! Also you get to hear the morning sermon on the way down from the speakers in the lights which is pretty cool. Our advise is don't bring too much up with you, the walk is hard enough and you can get tons of water in the main season from the tea shops, we took 3 litres of water and didn't need it. We would wholeheartedly recommend it. It took a few months to persuade my wife it was a good plan so if one of you is unsure start nagging now! Happy travels, Mr and Mrs V","January 5, 2017",0.0,0.0
