We managed to see many (baby) elefants and many other animals in their wild environment. We could also go very close to them. Only negative points were that in the morning we had a bit cold in the 4x4 because we were exposed to the air, mostly in the piece from pickup point to the park itself. We could see only laterally, would hve been great to have the possibility to remove the capote (no roof).","December 27, 2025",0.0,0.0

Lahiru is extremely enthusiastic and possesses an enormous amount of knowledge about the park's ecosystem. His passion for wildlife is contagious! We were particularly fascinated by his ability to identify various bird species from a distance. We also loved that he didn't just follow the ""caravan"" of other vehicles. He took us to quieter spots where we could enjoy the animals and the landscape without the crowds of other jeeps. Some of these spots really stands out as our favorite highlights from the trip. Lastly, Lahiru speaks excellent English. Communication both before and during the safari was seamless. Lahiru exceeded all our expectations.

From the moment we landed early in the morning, he was there—full of energy and ready to make our trip unforgettable. He took us straight to Sigiriya Rock, then on to Kandy and Ella as planned, but what truly made the experience special was everything he added along the way. Lahiru made sure we didn’t miss a single highlight in each location, and on our last day he convinced us to explore the coast—something we hadn’t even planned. It turned out to be one of the best parts of the whole trip! He took us to the most stunning beaches, including a few completely secluded ones, and even arranged for us to release baby turtles into the sea. We visited Galle Fort, and he took us to Hiriketiya to watch surfers and check out the coolest cafés. Throughout the journey, Lahiru was an absolute blast—knowledgeable, reliable, funny, and genuinely caring. He didn’t just guide us; he made everything possible and made the whole trip so much more enjoyable. If you’re visiting Sri Lanka, do yourself a favour and book Lahiru.

From the moment we first contacted him (we actually found his number on TripAdvisor), he went above and beyond — helping us sort out travel, accommodation, and all of our safari plans before we even arrived. Out on the safaris, he was incredible. Lahiru is hands down the best bird spotter I’ve ever met. We saw dozens of species — eagles, flycatchers, storks, and my personal favourite, the hornbill. Half the time I had no idea how he’d even spotted them, but he did, every single time. It wasn’t just birds either. He found us langurs, and we got amazingly close to several elephant herds. Watching their behaviour up close, calmly and respectfully, was something I’ll never forget. If you’re thinking about booking a wildlife trip, I can’t recommend Lahiru enough.

Lahiru was an amazing guide; how the heck he spotted the animals when he did is beyond my comprehension. He managed to find a small elephant heard within 20 minutes or so. He spotted a crocodile, and you all know how well camouflaged they are! We were up close and personal with elephants, crocodile (but not close 😜), buffalo, Zazu, lizards, dear, chameleons, stork, sea eagles, we even saw a pelican aswell as countless other birds The whole experience was magical. Very serene. I'm not sure it would have been as good without our guide. He was very knowledgeable, he knew where to go in the park to spot the most wildlife, and he knew everything about the animals we saw. He took his time and did not rush the tour like some others seemed to. The best thing about our guide was his love of wildlife, it was obvious. He cares deeply about the animals and respects their home.  We witnessed one jeep drive aggressively toward an elephant in order to scare her off the road, it was distressing to watch. Lahiru always waited for the animals to move on naturally, I appreciated that. If you're contemplating the safari and would say definitely do it, choose your guide wisely.

Communication was super easy. Lahiru responded very fast on WhatsApp (+94 76 272 6799), and we booked the tour just two days in advance. He picked us up right on time at 5:30 AM and brought us back to our hotel, Jungle Paradise (also a fantastic place with a great location), around 10:15 AM. Lahiru was extremely kind, patient, and never rushed us. He took his time at each spot so we could really observe the animals in a calm and respectful way. We saw elephants, crocodiles, lots of birds, and many more animals. Lahiru was very knowledgeable about all the wildlife, and he even lent us his binoculars, which made the experience even better. He also showed us some beautiful landscapes throughout the park. Overall, we had an amazing safari and couldn’t have asked for a better guide.

We also saw water buffaloes, crocodiles, deer, zazu (from lion king haha forgot the species' name) and lots of elephants including one month old baby elephant! Iahiru also had a bird book which was helpful to identify the species of birds seen. Also we were super impressed by his ability to find chameleons miles away!!","November 9, 2025",0.0,0.0

In itself a Safari with flakes, complete with breakfast and lunch inside the park in full respect of nature. Excellent and helpful driver, always careful not to disturb or annoy the animals. I would recommend this park above Yala (which I personally experienced) for several reasons. 1. The price is lower 2. It is located in a less crowded area even in August and therefore there are far fewer jeeps (something really not to be underestimated) 3. There are few leopards, but I found that even in Yala you rarely see them, so, you might as well 4. There are a lot of elephants, more than in Yala, and I had the chance to see them up close 5. I saw a rare 3 month old baby Elephant:) So overall I highly recommend it, it was a nice experience for us:) the 12-hour Safari obviously has a different price than less hours, but it allowed us to see a lot of elephants at sunset and with the rain, which in the dry season in August tempts them to go out more. There are also several varieties of very beautiful birds, crocodiles, fawns and buffalo. Super recommended!","August 12, 2025",0.0,0.0

I'd read good reviews  about Lahiru while planning the trip to Uda Walawe so contacted him via WhatsApp +94 76 272 6799 and arranged our Safari about 6 months previously. So Lahiru and his driver picked us up, as arranged, from our accommodation (Una Walawe Blue Sapphire Resort) at 5.30am and we got into the park as it opened without delay. Lahiru spotted animals while the driver dealt with the road. The jeep arranged was great for seeing out of. With Lahiru's help we spotted Crocodiles, elephants with babies, monkeys,eagles, buffalos and a variety of colourful birds. Lahiru was well connected with other guides so got to find out  where other guides were finding elephants that morning. We took a half day trip which was just right. The driver we had was careful and respectful of the animals. Lahiru had real enthusiasm about the animals. Lahiru gave us a great tip for later in the day after we left him of taking a walk from our accommodation to see Flying Foxes (fruit bats) taking off from a huge colony at dusk. Lahiru was also able to arrange a careful driver to take us up the winding roads to Sinharaja when we left the next day. All at reasonable rates.","July 29, 2025",0.0,0.0

The first animals we encountered were a group of elephants, including a two-week-old baby – we spent a long time with them in peace and awe. It felt like we had the whole park to ourselves. Lahiru took us off the main roads to places where no other jeeps went, allowing us to discover so much more. We saw a monitor lizard, crocodiles, leopard tracks, and many beautiful birds. Lahiru patiently showed us everything in an illustrated guidebook, shared interesting facts, and even lent us his binoculars so we could enjoy every detail. We had a short break by the lake for a snack, which added to the relaxed and intimate atmosphere of the trip.

The booking, which was very reasonably priced, came with a tour of the Udawalawe National Park. So, this visit wasn't planned and we had no expectations .... but everything just turned out to be a perfect experience!!! Udawalawe is the seventh largest national park in Sri Lanka and is mainly known for its elephant sightings. But we heard from our guide that on extremely rare occasions there has been sightings of leopards on evening tours. We chose the morning tour. Started from the camp at 6 am and arrived at the entrance to the park by 6.30 am. [We were told the best time to see the animals is either early morning or late evening. The park opens at 6 am but I am not sure of the closing time.] While there were some vehicles, it wasn't crowded. So, that's another plus about going as early as possible. [Also it's best to avoid local school holidays and long weekends.] Heavy rains had started two days prior (which was unusual for the region though) so we didn't have much expectations of seeing any animals. [We were also told the best time to visit the park was in the dry season from July - August where large herds of elephants would converge near the reservoir.] But to our surprise we saw around 10 elephants within 100 meters from the park entrance. Thereafter, there was a bit of a dry spell with no sightings except for birds and it started raining. But nevertheless we enjoyed the ride with our guide enthusiastically pointing out various birds. [While we did get a bit wet, the weather was cool and pleasant whereas a visit in the dry season would have been hot and dusty.] Then we met another herds of elephants with two baby elephants entertaining us with their antics. We stopped for a packed breakfast halfway through and all in all spent about 3 hours in the park. While park visits can always be a hit or miss, this experience turned out to be perfect. A lot of the credit should go to the echo team of the mahoora camp for their perfect organising. [I have written a separate review on our experience there.] They were so punctual, our driver was safe and reliable, our guide was knowledgeable and enthusiastic, the breakfast was lovely and the list goes on.... While you can always book a vehicle at the park entrance, it would always be better to book a vehicle in advance ( or even through a hotel, though that might include a mark up) to ensure that you avoid crowds and arrive at a time more likely to result in elephants sightings. It must also be mentioned that compared to some time back, the safari jeeps were also in relatively good condition both in terms of emissions and safety. Udawalawe National park also offers a free tusker sighting ;) The fellow is christened ""Bullet"" and can be found at the electric fence running parallel to the main road a little way after the park entrance (if you are coming from Udawalawe junction side) throughout the day and almost all year around. While the locals may urge you to feed him (and while that's why he is standing there) it's best not to do so for his own good health. Udawalawe National Park also has an Elephant  Orphanage and unlike Pinnawala, they release the baby elephants back into the wild after rehabilitation. You can pay a fee and see them being fed with milk. There is one session in the morning (not sure of the timing) and one at 2.30 pm. The entrance to this place is on a turn - off a little before the park entrance when coming from the Udawalawe junction. We went for a session in July of last year. While they do good work there (there is a also a programme to adopt/ sponsor a baby elephant) i had rather ambivalent feelings about the viewing experience of the feeding (those who know would know;) hence opted not to review that particular experience....","April 27, 2025",0.0,0.0

We chose a half-day sunrise tour and arrived just before the park opened. Based on excellent TripAdvisor reviews, I reached out to Lahiru directly to book our safari in advance. He arranged everything—picked us up from our accommodation, guided us through the park, and dropped us off afterward. Communication was smooth and easy. Lahiru was an outstanding guide. Within 15 minutes of entering the park, he had expertly steered us away from the other  jeep traffic, giving us a peaceful and memorable experience. The most magical moment was spending a quiet 30 minutes watching a family of elephants, including one-week-old and one-month-old calves—completely undisturbed and away from the crowds. Before our visit, I was a bit concerned about reports of overcrowding and jeeps jostling for position, but thankfully, our experience was the complete opposite. Lahiru’s proves his deep knowledge and genuine passion for the park—built from years of being a guide and also prior to that, working at the park itself.

We couldn’t have chosen a better Guide as he took a really good care of us by organizing a pick up in Tangalle and then dropping us off in Ella as well as making sure we see as many animals in the park as possible. From the very beginning we spoke via WhatsApp ( +94 76 272 6799 ) and Lahiru was very responsive and willing to make suggestions on when to go and how to adjust the safari to avoid possible rain shower in the afternoon. Lahiru is a very experienced Guide with many years spent on showing people around the elephants living in UNP but also trying to spot other animals and birds to make this trip even more enjoyable and fun. He’s very well-skilled and can even take very sharp pictures with your phone through the binoculars he’s bringing with himself. Apart from „hunting” for animals and trying to spot them among the bushes, Lahiru is a great story teller and provides interesting facts and tips about elephants and other animals too. He’s very mindfull and caring person, constantly making sure his passengers are satisfied and having a good time. We’ve seen many elephants, birds and other animals I can’t even name from the top of my head but overall the safari was a great adventure and excellent experience with wildlife animals and I would Highly recommend Lahiru as he’s the best Guide and a great company for this safari trip.","March 18, 2025",0.0,0.0

A tip: if you take a morning tour, it gets chilly in the early morning and a ride on a jeep gives you a special hair blow, so take some light jacket with you to keep you warm and some hat to protect yourself from sun (and dont forget a sunscreen).

It was a never before experience thanks to our wonderful guide Mr.Lahiru(+94-762726799). we got his number from the net but did not expect him to be so good in spotting birds which we could not spot inspite of looking in the same direction. Me and my camera had a wonderful time happily clicking away at the birds that he pointed out. He helped us spot more than 30 species of raptors and other birds. And the finale was the spotting of the elusive leopard with her cub. If it was not for Lahiru we would have missed it. We also spotted the sloth bear from close quarters. We are so grateful that Lahiru was our guide. He arranged the safari to Yala and Udawale. If we ever plan to visit for a safari to Sri Lanka I would without hesitation get in touch with him for the Safari. I would rate him 20 out 10.

The park had mainly elephants, which were nice, but again, not worth €100 for just elephants... There was also traffic. Yes, within the park because all the safari jeeps gathered in 1 place when they'd see an animal and we'd spend a good few minutes watching elephants. After 15 minutes again, you'd see elephants and watch for another few minutes... Other animals were peacocks, few falcon/ eagles, different birds, some monkeys, and we spotted 1 lizard & 1 small crocodilian. The jungle itself was nice, very green. It rained a bit which made it better (if you like rain). The trip was for 3 ½ - 4 hours long, that was tiring because it was repetitive.

On the way to the park we already saw the first elephant on the electric fence, which represents the border. That seems a bit sad, though. According to the guide, there are probably too many elephants and too little food, so there have been human/farmer-elephant conflicts in the past. Hence the electric fence. The safari itself was very nice water buffalo, numerous beautiful birds, some crocodiles and many elephants seen The elephants often only in small groups or individually, sometimes only 1-2 m away, which was impressive. The animals are obviously used to the jeeps, they were all very relaxed. Four hours was sufficient in my opinion and you should bring an off-road fitness, it was really off-road. The number of jeeps is still limited, at hotspots a maximum of 10 were on hand, which was different in Minneriya Park with large herds of elephants and jeeps.","July 21, 2024",0.0,0.0

Since we don't like to see animals in captivity we chose to visit Udawalawe National Park. We had not booked tickets in advance as our driver said it could be bought there. The first people to meet us at Udawalawe National Park were the safari drivers. After we had spoken to a safari driver, he shouted something in Sinhalese to all the other safari drivers who were parked in line. Since he was a bit stubborn, I wanted to talk to more drivers, but the others wouldn't even give me a price and said I should sit with the first one. We finally agreed that I should pay him 12,500. after we went in to buy the entrance tickets the safari driver went straight to the counter and gave me an even higher amount for the entrance fee than what was written on the outside. When I tried to ask the people at the counter they said that they neither spoke Tamil nor English. I agreed to pay 12,500 more than the price as the children wanted to see elephants so badly.

In general, I think the local authorities need to do something about overselling the tours in their parks, as the numbers of safari cars in the last two parks were insane. I have never seen so many jeeps on any given day in any of the countless safaris I’ve had all over Africa. Some sightings of elephants we had in Hurulu or one sighting of leopards in Yala were accompanied by dozens and dozens of jeeps, making it nearly impossible for us to even get a glimpse of the animals. This is the reason why I enjoyed Udawalawe the most. It is less visited, but has the same animals we saw in Yala National park, so observing the wildlife without too many other jeeps was way more enjoyable. I would recommend Sri Lanka for the bird watching more than for the animals. The amount of birds I was able to see and record was incredible. I organized a private 7-hour tour of Udawalawe park through Lahiru. His whatsapp number is ‪+94 76 272 6799‬. I contacted several providers and his price was very competitive. He arranged a very comfy van transport for me from Hikkaduwa beach at the most affordable price on a less than 12-hour notice. I made a very last minute booking.

What are you doing? You leave because you feel attacked and not at peace. That's what elephants do, there is one who didn't hesitate to charge into a vehicle, in fact the 4x4s all leave when it's hot... Overall you will see 5 elephants, 2 crocodiles in the water in the distance, but you will see some peacocks. No beast. In short, big scam I understand the animals on an area of 8000 hectares, they are far from this brothel for which the vehicle will be well placed to take photos. Ideally electric 4x4s which do not make noise and which do not pollute would already be a good start then there are 2 to 4 of you in a vehicle which can hold between 6 and 8. This is good for optimizing the number of 4x4s. Positive point the top driver For the rest I couldn't wait to leave. That's just my opinion.","March 26, 2024",0.0,0.0

Lahiru is so knowledgeable about elephants and other wildlife in the park. He spots things that you would have never seen yourself! Visiting the udawalawe national park was the absolute highlight of my trip. We saw around 20 elephants - some males on their own but mainly herds of females with their babies which was so lovely to see! The next day we also went to the elephant orphanage which is part of the national park. The babies who have lost their mums are looked after here until they are ready to go back into the main part of the national park / wild and you get to see them being fed. I absolutely love elephants so I went to another national park during my trip but it just did not compare to this day! Would highly recommend udawalawe with Lahiru as your guide - it’s just so lovely seeing the elephants in their natural habitat and it is not crowded with jeeps because the national park is so big and Lahiru made an effort to go different routes to other jeeps and was so respectful of the elephants! Not only did I have the best couple of days seeing the elephants, but Lahiru also helped me with my accommodation in Udawalawe, transport for the rest of my trip and recommendations of where to visit.

But you have to be observant/lucky to see a lot else: deer are likely, mongooses, monitors, wild boar, jackal, crocs passably likely.  There's a good number of birds. The peacocks are amazing. One minus is the price at $35 pp.  ....for which you get hopelessly rutted tracks and far too much traffic, noisy diesel engines.  on top of the $35 you have to hire your jeep at, say, $20 for 3 hours, and a further few dollars if you want a spotter too ...don't expect witty repartee. For the most part, you have the thing you are seeing named ...and not much else. We had a better afternoon trip for sightings than we did by getting up for a 6.30 start (although fewer ellies) There doesn't seem to be much etiquette amongst the jeeps - either towards the animals or towards other jeeps. The elephants seem to be remarkably chilled about it. Udawalawe is good, but it doesn't compare to an african safari. One or two half day visits are more than enough unless you have a bird interest (in which case you'd need to find a better than average guide)","February 11, 2024",0.0,0.0

We paid for the safari with our stay at the River camp. When we arrived we were told we needed to pay the entrance fee - approximately $30 per person on top - so basically paid for an expensive driver in a jeep - not sure if there is a cheaper way to do it - like book without safari and then negotiate when you get there? Anyway - a guide would have also cost more on top so we declined as we know a lot about the animals already. As we came into the park, we were effectively following in convoy and we were shocked that so many people were in their own jeeps - some people literally on their own. This made us feel quite uncomfortable, as we would have preferred the option to share a jeep for a lesser price so that there were not so many diesel spewing engines around the animals and noise. It took quite awhile to find anything at first- then the drivers would let each other know and there would be a bit of a ‘traffic jam’ for a bit, which we didn’t like. On the positive note, we did see a a lot of diversity in the wildlife. No leopards - but that would have been a bonus. Would not go again though and my partner felt the same. It felt as they were really trying to commercialise this place to the max and I think they have reached their tipping point!","January 15, 2024",0.0,0.0

The park was created to provide a sanctuary for wild animals displaced by the construction of the Udawalawe Reservoir on the Walawe River, as well as to protect the catchment of the reservoir. The reserve covers 30,821 hectares (119.00 sq mi) of land area and was established on 30 June 1972.[1] Before the designation of the national park, the area was used for shifting cultivation (chena farming). The farmers were gradually removed once the national park was declared. The park is 165 kilometres (103 mi) from Colombo. Udawalawe is an important habitat for water birds and Sri Lankan elephants. It is a popular tourist destination and the third-most visited park in the country.[2]","November 23, 2023",0.0,0.0

Nothing was too much trouble, he organised a transfer from Ella to Udawalawe, overnight accommodation at a wonderful safari lodge for us and a transfer onward to Galle. He is such a knowledgeable, kind and helpful guy. His passion for wildlife in the park is infectious. He is so brilliant at spotting wildlife and was able to share fascinating facts about every species. We took a different route from all the other jeeps, he instinctively knows where to find the animals. When seeing the elephants at really close quarters to the jeep, many other jeeps were around us and then having taken photos, drove away. Lahiru knew if we backed up and waited a moment the big tusker elephant would appear looking for the ‘ladies’ and we witnessed their encounter. We saw many different species - monkey, buffalo, deer, monitor, mongoose, crocodile, peacock, owl, many types of birds and reptiles, it was simply fabulous. Seriously, you need to book him for your safari trip.

The first hour was quiet we maybe only saw 2-3 elephants, peacock and a land monitor. But when we went to the clearing by the lake there was 10s of elephants, birds, spotted deer, water buffalo, a crocodile in the distance, painted stork, and a mongoose. Make sure you take water and suncream with you and maybe a snack too as a large part is of course waiting around to find the animals. (Most of the cars we saw are covered but depending on time of day the sun still comes through the sides).

Solo travelers pay $43USD, which is about $7USD more than two travelers entering together and so on ($43USD for individuals vs $36 USD if you're a couple). Also, as a point of reference the current entrance fee for Kruger National Park in South Africa is $27USD. $43USD is an extremely high entrance fee for any National Park in the world.  I know there's a cost savings on vehicles when you share one, but a solo traveler penalty is ridiculous. I tried to find people at the gate entrance to share a safari with. Many of the tourists were interested,  but the guides have a ""mafia"" type ""wilderness association"" and refused to let any tourists share costs. Was it worth it? Maybe once. Well, when others described ""herds of elephants"" in their reviews, I was expecting herds, like in Tanzania, Kenya or like other places in Africa.  I believe herds in Sri Lanka means families of elephants, which numerically speaking are smaller-- maybe 5 or 6 in a family vs 10+ in Africa. There is a good variety of wildlife-- elephants, deer, monkeys, buffalo, crocodiles, mongoose, jackals, boar, peacocks and other birds. It was nice. If you're interested in going, I eventually went with the owner of my homstay, Nalaka, +94 77 635 8192. He took me on a 4 hour jeep safari for 8,500 rp.

We visited in January and had a 3-hour safari around 3 pm to 6 pm and it was an unforgettable experience. We saw nearly 60 elephants during our safari, which was truly breathtaking. The park is home to a wide variety of wildlife, including elephants, deers, crocodiles, and many species of birds. Our safari keep driver/guide was excellent and made sure that we had a safe and enjoyable experience. He was also very knowledgeable about the park and its wildlife, which added to the overall experience. It's important to note that while visiting the park, we should take care to minimize our impact on the environment. This means not littering and following the park's rules and regulations. Overall, Udawalawe National Park is a must-visit destination for anyone who wants to experience the beauty of Sri Lanka's wildlife and nature.

Saw many elephants, some crocodiles, deer, horn-bills, peacocks, and eagles. Nothing better than seeing animals in their natural habitat. Tour guide was pleasant enough but was more a driver than a guide. He pointed out some more of the animals but not much more than that. Would have been great to have some more information on the animals. Was also a shame to see so many tour jeeps with just one or two people in. We would have been happy to share our jeep if it meant less vehicles in the park. At some points we were stuck in queues to get a look at the animals.

Lahiru was one of the best guides we have ever had! From start to finish, he was courteous, well organized and extremely knowledgeable. His animal spotting abilities are second-to-none. His extensive knowledge and deep passion for his work and Udewalawe National Park were evident every step of the way. Unlike the vast majority of other guides we saw operating during our day with Lahiru, he was always very aware of the boundaries of the animals and did everything in his power to ensure they were given enough space to feel comfortable and respected. One thing that really stood out was Lahiru's willingness to go above and beyond in terms of providing you with a real feel for the park. While all the other guides simply beelined for the elephants in a dusty convoy of 20 vehicles, Lahiru strategized the day in a way which made us feel as though we actually got to experience the park itself. We spent time driving through the back trails of the park looking not just for elephants but for all the animals Udewalawe has to offer. We saw tons of elephants as well but got to do so as an individual group, not disturbed by the mass of jeeps all going to the same place at the same time. All in all, we cannot recommend Lahiru enough. He offers a true 5-star experience and we will be absolutely be joining him for another safari if we ever return to Sri Lanka. Contact him as soon as you can as he often books well over a month in advance (and for good reason) - he's the best! Thanks Lahiru.","February 22, 2022",0.0,0.0

I’d totally recommend booking a tour with him instead of a regular jeep at the door - as most guides are just driving around without any decent explanations. Moreover, we went away from the main roads and had hours without seeing any other jeep. Contact Lahiru for a more tailor made, ethical and informative trip instead of a typical tourist round.

In addition to elephants, and we saw many, there were spotted deer, sambar, crocodile, jackal, water buffalo, lots and lots of peacocks in display and many other birds. Elephants were single males sometimes but also several large family groups. And nice picturesque spots to just sit in quiet and wait to see if anything passes out of the bush. Our guide from Induwaru Safari Resort where we stayed was exceptional. Care was taken when driving not to disturb animals, plenty of time allowed for viewing to our requirements, effort obviously put in not to follow the crowd. Breakfast was taken on safari, sandwiches, egg, pancakes, fruit juice and fruit. A mobile breakfast better than many we have been served in the accommodations.","February 16, 2022",0.0,0.0
