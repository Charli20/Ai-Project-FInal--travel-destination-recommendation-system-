It’s small compared to other ruins, but the details are incredible. The pillars are carved to look like lotus stems, each one slightly twisting as it rises. It’s amazing how delicate and artistic the stonework is, considering it’s over 800 years old. It’s a quiet spot, and many people skip it, so you might even have it to yourself. I loved standing there imagining the ceremonies and gatherings that happened inside. If you love discovering hidden details and beautiful architecture, don’t miss this gem while exploring Polonnaruwa.","July 8, 2025",0.0,0.0
