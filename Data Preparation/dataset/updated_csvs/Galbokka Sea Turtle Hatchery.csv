Kaveesh guided us round and talked through the different stages of turtle life, as we saw very young through old turtles in about 8 tanks. We had never seen turtles like this before, or even thought about the dangers of ocean plastics, nets and boats to the animals. Both educational and fun; thoroughly recommend.","December 19, 2025",0.0,0.0

The staff greeted us warmly, and the entry fee was very reasonable. They took us on a guided walk around the center, explaining the life cycle of the turtles and the different species they protect. We got to see their most recent hatchery with expected hatching dates, and then each tank where they carefully described the turtles inside and the treatments or rehabilitation they were receiving. The team is incredibly knowledgeable, friendly, and you can genuinely feel how much they care about their work. The whole area is clean, peaceful, and not overly touristy, which makes the experience feel more authentic and dedicated to real conservation. Overall, it’s informative, meaningful, and absolutely worth the visit. Highly recommend!","November 15, 2025",0.0,0.0

From the moment we arrived, we could feel the care, dedication, and love that the staff and volunteers pour into protecting these incredible creatures. Seeing the rescued turtles up close — some recovering from injuries, others preparing to be released back into the ocean — was both humbling and hopeful. The team took the time to explain each stage of the conservation process, from hatching to rehabilitation, and their passion was contagious. What touched us most was how personal it all felt. Every turtle has a story, and the staff share those stories with such tenderness that you can’t help but fall in love with these gentle beings. Having the honor to watch one of their turtles make its way toward and back into the ocean we’ll never forget — a reminder of the power of kindness and the importance of protecting our planet. This place doesn’t just rescue turtles; it restores hope. 🐢💚 If you ever have the chance to visit or support their work, don’t hesitate — you’ll leave with a full heart and a renewed respect for the ocean and all its life. Thank you Charith. Thank you for the work you do and thank you for the fresh coconut 🌴 🥥. You were the highlight of our mother/daughter Sri Lanka trip. 💙💚","November 13, 2025",0.0,0.0

Our guide was incredibly informative and engaging, helping the kids understand the dangers turtles face in Sri Lanka and explaining the species that are common in the region. A real highlight was being able to hold some baby green turtles—a truly beautiful experience, especially as it was the children’s first time interacting with them. We also got to see how the team rescues and cares for injured or disabled turtles, which was both fascinating and eye-opening. It was not only educational but also inspiring to see the dedication of the staff. Our guide mentioned that the funds generated from visits go directly towards feeding and caring for the turtles, which made the experience feel even more meaningful.

You can see damaged turtles that they try where possible to heal. They have only a few very small turtles because keeping the turtles, more than some days is not good. So the young turtles are released as soon as possible at the beach at the right time to make sure they enter the ocean safely. This is not Europe, so the protection program is fully based on donations by visitors. You can donate the costs of eggs, if available, and make the experience of putting the eggs yourself in the clean and protected sand with the Hatchery.  The act are usually brought by people from the village to the Hatchery. They get money for the eggs, otherwise they would eat them or sell them. That was very normal not so long ago and the people in this country are to a large extent poor and very poor. Charith is also willing to give a very interesting tour in the Temple close by.  he knows a lot about Buddhism and he practices its principles. Don’t forget to donate if you visit them. They will not ask for money, but there is a box at the entrance where you may put in money. With $12 can save a whole nest of turtles. When the turtles hatch, they sent you a video if you leave your WhatsApp number.  For me, it was a great experience and I have been there several times last year and I will this year. Make sure you go to this one and not strand in another one. Is it not so easy to find, is nearly at the end of the beach,  if you come over the beach walking to Galbokka.  The walk at the beach is wonderful.  If you come by Tuktuk be aware that some drivers prefer  to bring you to another hatchery,  because they get money or because it belongs to family or friends.

The place has several small ponds that are used to rehabilitate injured sea turtles, to raise and strengthen newly born sea turtles, and a complex of nests that were copied from the beach to keep the eggs. When we were there, we saw 3 types of sea turtles and tiny turtles that were just born that morning that are kept in a tank until the evening when it gets dark to increase their chances of survival. For sea turtle lovers, it seems and feels that they care, they doing a great effort to help theses sea turtles and their goal is to restore the sea turtle population, but they don't have the financial ability to do everything they would like, the ponds are small, the turtles are big, and there are also For example, a case of an injured sea turtle that got air in its shell so that it can't dive and lives in a really small water tank, which was very difficult to see, on the other hand, they don't have the money to finance the treatment that this turtle needs to return it to the sea. The entrance costs 2000 Sri Lankan rupees, which is their source of income to finance the place. According to what we were told, they do not have any government funding. The money they get used to buy sea turtle eggs that are collected by fishermen to sell for food, buy food for some of the turtles, a veterinarian when needed, maintenance, and more, all financed by the place only. One of the workers gave us a tour and explained everything they do at the center, and answered all of our questions. In this center, only 3 people work in total. They would be happy for volunteers, including volunteer families, to help with all the center's current activities, including releasing turtles into the sea. From what I understand, you can just reach them, they hardly have any volunteers, and you can also contact them on their Facebook page.

We spoke at length to the staff and volunteers who help run it and they are very knowledgable about the turtle species, their history and their probability of survival. They are earnest in their determination to make a difference in both helping the turtles survive, but also educating others in actions that we all need to take. Yes they allow visitors to participate by burying the eggs, but they made sure there was no sweat on our hands to contaminate them first. We never felt under pressure to buy merchandise or other money making schemes, although we did manage to buy some t shirts, but this was because we wanted to make a donation to their work and take away a momento as well as some pictures and wonderful memories. The large turtles that are kept in the tanks were there because they had been rescued following injuries mainly caused by human negligence. Fishing nets appear to be one of the most frequent causes. After a period of recuperation and care, they will be returned to the sea. A couple will never be returned to the sea because their injuries will almost certainly mean they will not survive. My overall impression was that if you are prepared to show interest in the work being carried out here, then the people who run are more than happy to spend as much time as you want telling you about the work that they carry out here.","March 3, 2019",0.0,0.0
