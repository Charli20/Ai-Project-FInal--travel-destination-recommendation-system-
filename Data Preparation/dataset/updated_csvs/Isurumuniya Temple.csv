This ancient monastic complex, believed to have been established in the third century BCE by King Devanampiya Tissa, shortly after the arrival of Buddhism Sri Lanka, has been shaped and enriched by generations of subsequent rulers. Our exploration began at the temple’s archaeology museum, home to a remarkable collection of rock carvings.  The centrepiece, the bas-relief known as the ""Isurumuniya Lovers"", dating back to the fifth century CE, captivated me with its delicate depiction of a woman seated gracefully on a man’s lap – a timeless symbol of artistry and emotion.  Surrounding this masterpiece were numerous other sculptures, each radiating an almost unbelievable beauty and craftsmanship.  I was immersed for over an hour, admiring these treasures and reflection on the stories they silently conveyed. After our time in the museum, we ascended the rock outcrop to visit the small stupa, enjoying sweeping views and a sense of tranquility that seemed to linger in the air.  The experience was both spiritually uplifting and artistically inspiring. A visit to ancient Anuradhapura would be incomplete without experiencing the wonders of Isurumuniya – a place where history, spirituality and art converge in unforgettable harmony.","December 21, 2025",0.0,0.0

The temple is full of history, calm energy, and beautiful carvings—especially the famous “Lovers” sculpture carved into the rock. A small tip for visitors: make sure to wear appropriate clothing (shoulders and knees covered) as it is a sacred place. We weren’t properly dressed, but luckily we were able to rent sarong-style wraps at the entrance, which allowed us to still enjoy the visit respectfully. The surrounding ponds, stone architecture, and quiet atmosphere make this temple a perfect stop for anyone interested in culture, spirituality, or photography.

The figure of a man and horse carved on the rock by the side of the image house was believed to be Agni as fire, and the man sitting in the royal posture as ""Parjanya,"" the rain god. A pre-Buddhist cult worshipping the rain god may have continued throughout the Anuradhapura period because the sculpture is believed to have been created between the 5th and 7th centuries.

The Isurumuniya temple was built by Devanampiyatissa (307 - 267 BC)during his rule of Anuradhapura.  He was son of King Mutasiva who ruled in 367-307BC, who built the Mahamevnawa Park and grandson of King Pandukabhaya founder of Anuradhapura kingdom ! According to historical facts, during Devanampiyatissa’s reign the Buddhist Monk(Thero) Mahinda(Mahendra) brought Buddhism to Sri Lanka. It stated 500 children of high-caste were ordained into Buddhism, and Isurumuniya was built for them to reside. Mahinda Thero lived here for a while. It also stated Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi Tree Sapling was brought by daughter of Emperor Ashoka, Theri Sangamitta, also sister of  Monk Mahindra(Mahinda).","April 7, 2019",0.0,0.0

We spent about 40 minutes having the history of the the Rock Temple explained to us and visiting the different areas. Of particular interest was the reclining Buddha and the history of his life. As with all the temples and stupors we found them to be extremely challenging in the hot sun, many areas were just too hot to walk on, you’ve been warned.

Upon my entry I was overcome by the monotone prayers coming from the speakers at the front of the temple, the feel of warm dirt beneath my bare feet, and the smell of flowers which came with every breath of crisp air I took in....

Be prepared to have your feet burned off. The temple itself is nothing spectacular.  There is a old bath with some carvings, and stairs to climb up a boulder.  There's another grotto kind of built into a cave with Buddha statues.  Interesting, if you don't mind the hundreds of bats that have made it its home - although you can get some photos there.  Once you see all three things, each worth about 5-10 minutes of your time, you're pretty much done...  I honestly found the surrounding lily ponds and view of the reservoir more interesting than the temple itself.  Definitely see that. All in all, a somewhat mediocre site as far as historical/cultural attractions go.  I pegged down because of 1) the shoe policy: temples elsewhere, for example, often hand out clean flip flops to use.  and 2) The site itself was simply not that spectacular.
