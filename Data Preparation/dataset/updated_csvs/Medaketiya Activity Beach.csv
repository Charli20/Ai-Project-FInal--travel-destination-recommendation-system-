Maybe we were just unlucky the day we went, but litter and local beach boys from nearby Tangalle town who stare/hound you seem to be more permanent problems. Some decent restaurants nearby to choose from though the fare seemed to only be curry or seafood, salad & chips. Given some of the other outstanding beaches west of Tangalle, heading towards Mirissa, better to explore further.","March 4, 2015",0.0,0.0

There are plenty of beachside cafés and cheap accommodation. The town end of the beach is a little industrialized but the further east you go, the better the beach.

The owner and his family are very very kind and friendly and always try to help you out and feel comfortable. The rooms were very clean but simple, with big bathrooms and beach infront. They offer several meals for the typical tourist price but still fair and very delicious! WiFi included. Unfortunately there are many stones at the shore so that it is really dangerous to go swimming in front of the bungalows. But few meters to right you can swim easily!","March 13, 2014",0.0,0.0

We highly recommend ""Shehani guesthouse"". I do not find this guesthouse on tripadvisor, but I would like to share my experiences about this guesthouse anyway. The guesthouse is located almost next to the Ibis guesthouse. Its run by a Sri Lankan family. They have one cabana and three rooms. We got a simple but clean and cosy room with outdoor bathroom for only 3000 rupee a night. The breakfast they serve is really good and there's a choice between a wide range of food. the restaurant is right at the beach, its just amazing to eat under the palmtrees. We would recommend this guesthouse to everyone!","January 21, 2014",0.0,0.0

However, do not venture out far as the waves are strong and the undertow (current pulling you into the ocean) can be extremely dangerous. Also, as the beach is across from a road, you notice locals staring at tourists in skimpy bikinis, so be careful crossing the street as drivers are very distracted!","January 19, 2014",0.0,0.0

Golden sands, crashing waves and palm trees. The area was unspoiled by tourists and was generally quiet... the strength of the waves shouldn't be ignored though, even paddling can result in being swept off your feet and sunglasses flying off your face!","April 26, 2013",0.0,0.0
