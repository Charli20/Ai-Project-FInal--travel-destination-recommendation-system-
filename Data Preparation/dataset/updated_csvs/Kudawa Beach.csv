The beach is quiet, clean, and surrounded by nature, making it ideal for travelers who want to relax away from busy tourist areas. The ocean views are beautiful, especially in the morning and evening. It’s also a nice area for dolphin and whale watching during the season. My clients enjoyed the calm environment and simple beauty of this coastal area.","December 21, 2025",0.0,0.0

I am not sure it is save to swim (the water is not that clean) and I supposed it is swim at your own risk as there isn't any facilities available for shower after swimming. I didn't see any food vendors around as well. Basically it is an empty beach that good to take a walk and enjoy the sound of the wind & wave. I went there a took a couple pf pictures, walked a little further the see the local catching fishes at the lagoon. It is a spot that the sea is in front of you and lagoon is behind of you. This is impressive and there are coconuts trees laying around. I enjoyed it very much. Do make sure you have your sunscreen with you as there isn't any shelter around.","September 23, 2019",0.0,0.0
