Even though Sri Lanka is a country of having many nice waterfalls, most of those are located in hill country which we will have to spend more time when travelling from Colombo. You have to drive from Colombo - Rathnapura main road and have to turn left near Kuruwita. There is a name board at the road where you have to get that turn. The hight of this waterfall is only 30 m. But it has a nice view. The name ""Bopath Ella"" has derived from it's shape. The shape of it looks like a ""Boo Leaf"" (a leaf of Ficus religiosa) when the waterfall is rich with water during the rainy season. Even though some people used to have a bath at the nearby pond, it is very dangerous to bath at the areas closer to the waterfall because there is a risk of increasing the water level rapidly mostly during rainy seasons.

It was around 1 p.m. and the hike up to the falls was too much of an effort, but we were very keen to get a good view of the falls. The only option was to go to the nearby restaurant which was facing the waterfall. We were tired after a long drive, and since we wanted a good view of the waterfall we decided to go to the restaurant instead of walking in the hot sun towards the water. The attendant at the parking area came with us. The place was deserted, there were used glasses and tea cups lying about. The attendant said there was neither food nor cool drinks available, only tea. After climbing to the top level which gave us a fantastic view of the waterfall, we were served sweetened tea by the same attendant, in spite of informing him that none of us took sugar in our tea. There were mops and cleaning equipment lying in the corridors. The 'Manager' appeared much later as we wanted to settle the bill. The place was thoroughly disorganised. However, I should mention that the hotel garden was beautiful and well maintained, in spite of the poor service we received. To give the benefit of the doubt, perhaps they had not quite got round to their normal routine after the Sinhalese New year holidays - the time of year when everything comes to a grinding halt in Sri Lanka. Along the way to our destination  we saw heaps of rubbish dumped by the roadside in polythene bags. Stray dogs and crows were having a field day. The negligence of the surrounding area and the environment was appalling. Nature is very resilient. Sri Lanka is a beautiful country blessed with such fantastic scenery and natural resources. Humans including visitors, locals, vendors and the hotel owners spoil it. There is much room for improvement around this beautiful waterfall which I would have rated 'Excellent' by itself, if not for the human factor.","April 19, 2016",0.0,0.0

Even when no rain in the area suddenly water levels of the falls gets higher due to rains in over lands. It was near Adams peak mountain. So when mountain gets rain it flow down to nearby lower lands. Also lots of locals visiting and keep your distance from them.,"October 22, 2015",0.0,0.0
