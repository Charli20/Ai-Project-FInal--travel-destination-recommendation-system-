But this time the famous publishing house got it wrong. Not everything, of course! The beach is long with fine golden sand and slopes very slowly into the sea. The water due to the sand is not particularly transparent except in the early morning. But in addition to the Guide you can add many things. For example, the small town consists almost all of Guest houses, hotels and restaurants but seems dead if not at mealtimes. There is no walk or bar open in the evening, in fact, I doubt there are bars if not those of the hotels. Dogs, cows and crows can annoy someone who can't stand free animals. On Saturdays and Sundays, the beach near the Point of Sale is frequented by multitudes of Sri Lankans (you feel a bit embarrassed to be in costume and so it's better to move to the area of the two ""Resorts""). Moreover, prices are not at all affordable compared to the services offered (Pigeon Island costs more than $ 40 each without discounts for anyone: now many people, like us, give it up to go snorkeling around Angel Rock).","August 5, 2024",0.0,0.0

Most Sri Lankan visitors swim here and there is a 400m or so clean stretch of sand with lifeguards. South (towards Trinco) of this stretch there is a bit of plastic litter on the beach.This worsens after about 1km to the extent that you wouldn't want to walk further let alone swim. You can't directly walk North along the beach as there is a naval training facility. Beyond that there is a short decent stretch of sand in front of a couple of smart hotels (there is also a ticket booth for Pigeon Island here.) Further North the beach is pretty filthy.

My hotel was only 2mins away, so I was very pleased to see there was a lifeguard area just 100m down the beach.  As it was the monsoon season, there were very few visitors, except at weekends when crowds of Sri Lankans arrived in buses to spend the day, bathing and partying, which was a lot of fun as everyone was so friendly.  There's a little lane of shops and cafes behind the beach where everyone gathered to buy toys, sweets and street food,  though it was closed during the week due to lack of visitors.  Most people stay in the lifeguard area, but I enjoy beach walks, so several times I walked a few kilometres southwards, and had it all to myself.  During the monsoon season the sea can be very rough, so it's almost impossible to swim as the current is so dangerous.  Most of the local visitors just stood in the water, in all their clothes!

But most of the time, we are dispppointed when we see unclean beaches with stuff discarded by beach goers. Nilaveli was different. The beach was suprisingly clean. I could see why the beach was called Nilaveli - i loved the blue sand and the clean water. Though I didn't venture out of swim, I stood in the water for almost an hour enjoying the feel of clean water against the sand. The beach is relatively less crowded on a weekday and filled with locals. I can spend an entire day here, enjoying the sand and the water.","September 3, 2015",0.0,0.0
