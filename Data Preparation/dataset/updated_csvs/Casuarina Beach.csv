I was disappointed.   Pay 500r as a foreigner to enter area. There are toilet and changing facilities.  Actually public toilet was spotlessly clean which is not usually the case. The beach is clean but you can't get away from young men who are obsessed with staring and it becomes uncomfortable.  I elected to stay dressed.  Sat enjoyed sand and scenery.  There are boats coming and going. Family friendly. Lots of sri lankans come in special buses as groups. There is a shop for drinks,snacks and basic food.

The beach acquired its name from the pine-like casuarina trees planted on the shore.  The bright-blue waters were shallow, pleasing, enjoyable and warm.  People 75 metres in the sea could stand quite comfortably with head up.  The area for bathing is marked out by flags.  There is a ""Surf Point"" manned by lifeguards. The Changing facilities are basic.  Simple enclosures one each for Male and female. The scotting toilet facilities available are unclean. You can have a shower at a cost of Rs 40 each.

You can catch several local bus lines to go to Karainagar (including bus nr. 782 which we took). The ticket is 50 LKR per person and the ride takes around 1 hour. If you tell the conductor that you wanna go to Casuarina beach he will tell you when you should get out of the bus and from there it is a 15 minutes (slow) walk to the beach. It costs 20 LKR entrance fee. There are toilets, changing „rooms“ (more like walls) anf shops for drinks and snacks. The beach is a nice sight but be aware that you are only allowed in the water directly at the beach. We tried to find a spot a bit further away but a beach guard sent us out of the water and back to the beach immediately. Unfortunately our overall experience was not positive. When we arrived we were the only girls. The beach was crowded with young local men and boys and soon „annoy the white girls“ was their favourite hobby. They followed us around staring exessively, they always sat unneccessarily close to us, threw stuff in our direction and took pics with their smartphones even after we told them they shouldn't. In the time we spent travelling through Sri Lanka we never felt this uncomfortable. When we were about to give up and leave, a bus full of nice older locals came and the atmosphere changed to the better but since we already changed out of our swim clothes and the bus seemed to take only a short break we decided to leave anyways.

It's a great place to relax and have a swim in the evening and the water is about 25°C, which is the optimum temperature to have a relaxing bath, according to my opinion. This beach is unknown to most of the tourists who come to Sri Lanka. The sea is quite shallow  and you can wade offshore for about 150 metres, when it's about 5 feet deep. The sea seems to be calm, something you won't find in most of the other beaches in Sri Lanka. One of the huge problems in this beach is the lack of an allocated place to keep your valuables while you bath. In the evening, you can see many people there enjoying and most of them don't leave until dusk. You can't visit there after sunset because there is no source of artificial light and also there can be some debris at times, which is not a considerable problem because when you compare it with the other beaches in Sri Lanka , this beach is cleaner and has less pollution.

Enjoy the views across the Jaffna lagoon when travelling on the causeway to Karainagar island. The beach opens to the public at 7am, we reached there bang on 7 and had the beach all to ourselves. Probably due to the time of year we were there, the wind was biting cold and the water was quite chilly. The sea is not the pool like calm that you would expect reading some of the reviews, it certainly has waves but the waves are not high and the water is not deep so you can go a fair distance in. My advice is that while this is a very enjoyable beach, its not fabulous enough on its own to warrant such a long drive from the city. Try combining your visit with other attractions in the area such as the Keerimalai hot springs, Dambakolapatuna, or maybe plan to have lunch at the Fort Hammenheil restaurant. But go early to avoid crowds especially on weekends.","February 21, 2015",0.0,0.0

Another difference is the  the color of the sand it is also a bit different and it was very soft making it a pleasant experience.
