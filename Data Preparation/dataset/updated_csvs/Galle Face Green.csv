Promenade by the water with street food shacks, tents and vendors. Feeling adventurous, we started with salty chillie mango. I didn't mind it but have never seen my wife's expression before😂. We had an assortment of prawn Pattie things which they fry in boiling oil in front of you. Topped with chopped onions and sauce (we asked for spicy)They were really tasty and delicious and edible, prawn heads and all. Cheap too, like 3 for 100 rupees with some variation. Also had chick peas with spicy sauce which were very nice. Many locals and others dipping feet in the water with life guard on duty. I think may have never been to the sea before.

However, we nearly fell vicitm to a rouge tuk tuk driver and his tout. We left the front of our hotel and walked towards Fort, and a chap started talking to us. He said do you remember me from Shangri-la, I saw you this morning. I didn't, however with the curse of English incesent politeness, my wife said she did (later admitted she did not) . He offered to show us the way to the local temple, only to state shortly in to the trip that we should take a tuk tuk as there may be some protest today. He summoned a tuk tuk and off we went, leaving him waving us off. Having travelled extensively, experience told me to obtain a price for this first, only to be told that the price was on the meter - suspiciously there was no meter present. In fairness the tour was very good, the temple beautiful and the driver gave us some good information. We were taken back to the hotel, however then came the fun part. The driver stopped us equidistant and therefore as far as was reasonably possible from the hotel entrance and promptly demanded 6500lkr for what was a 10 minute each way journey. He was firmly rebuffed however was persistent in return. We then trudged away from him having refused to hand any cash over at all. Arriving at the Shangri La security Post we spoke with the guard, whose eyes bulged at the demanded price. As soon as the captain of the tuk tuk saw we were in conversation with the guard, the price miraculously changed from 6500 to 650. Weird as I had confirmed the demand of 6500 with captain tuk tuk three times on my phones calculator. Little sod.

He was offering us so much food and we asked for rice, calamari, a sausage and a cheese naan. He then offered us some noodle thing and I said “can we have half noodle half rice”. He said yes. We stupidly didn’t ask the price. He then brought us 2 x rice dishes, 1 x noodle, 2 x sausages, 1 x calamari and 2 x beers. We presumed they were being very friendly  and this was just the portion sizes. Despite being more food then we could ever eat we laughed it off and said “oh well it’s street food - how much can it really cost”... 8,900 rupees which is £40!!!! He brought the menu over and talked through it exactly and added it up in front of us. I said no that is too expensive - you’ve shown us the wrong prices. But the owners wouldn’t budge and we left feeling ripped off for mediocre food. Other than that the beach is a state - the only nice thing is that there are lots of kites being flown which is pretty - we would of bought one and had a go but we were too wounded by the over pricing.","August 13, 2018",0.0,0.0
