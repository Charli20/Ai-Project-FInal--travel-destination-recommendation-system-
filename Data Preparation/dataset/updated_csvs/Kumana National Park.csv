You will then see countless birds, from the ibis to 5 diverse stork species, but also many Crocs, occasionally an elephant, wild boar and Axish - and, yes, leopards. Their density is said to be highest here in the world, not in Yala, for example. Kumana is never as crowded as neighbouring Yala, probably because most of Arugam are just for surfing or bathing...the drive here alone takes around an hour, but is scenically really super nice. Of course, good luck is always part of an animal observation, of course, sighting a leopard is never guaranteed. Beautiful places to get out and legs represented on the Kumbuk-lined shore of an inlet in the park","September 28, 2025",0.0,0.0

Located in the southeastern corner of Sri Lanka, Kumana has preserved its pristine natural beauty. The drive from Arugam Bay is among the finest—evoking memories of colonial-era roadworks. With untouched jungle on one side and the shimmering sea on the other, the journey infuses an energetic sense of wonder. For those interested in Buddhist culture, Kudumbigala Monastery is another must-visit on this trip. With a history spanning over 2,000 years, its serene isolation has helped preserve the site's authenticity and spiritual charm.","July 14, 2025",0.0,0.0

Leopards and bear had been seen the previous day but we were not lucky on this day. We saw herds of elephants with young ones, a lot of deer, not so usual types of colourful birds, huge crocodiles and a lot of peacocks too.

This biodiverse paradise is a haven for wildlife enthusiasts, boasting an incredible array of fauna and flora that are unique to this region. What makes Kumana stand out is its status as an important bird sanctuary, with over 200 species of birds including rare and endangered species like the black-necked stork and greater flamingo. In addition to birdwatching opportunities, visitors can also spot elephants, leopards, sloth bears, and many other animals in their natural habitat. The park's mix of wetlands, forests, and grasslands create a stunning landscape that offers a different kind of safari experience compared to other national parks in Sri Lanka.

Contact Manaf (0779690896) The way our driver tracked down the leopard was simply incredible! On that day almost every jeep we encountered said the leopards are no where to be found and they all left by 5.30 pm. But our driver was so determined and kept on repeating a small route (which he guessed there could be a leopard hiding) over and over again. When he repeated the same route for the 3rd time we got frustrated (thinking he's deceiving us) and almost asked him to leave the park. But when we came back for the 4th lap we were shocked to see some fresh leopard footprints over the tyre marks on the road (it had waited for us to move and then crossed the road!). Then he quickly took us to another route deep into the forest, all of a sudden booom the bad guy appeared on the road out of nowhere. The sighting lasted for about 5 min and we were the only jeep around :) By the end of the trip we almost ended up spotting all the animals the park had to offer!

One can enjoy the park as it is not spoilt with too many visitors and vehicles. Roaming animals have their freedom and we can enjoy the viewimg them in their Marital habitat. People of the country has to value these without dumping their rubbish out of their vehicles as plastics can be seen around and feel sorry. Authorities must take more care about the people who stay overnight in those rented bungalows with stringent rules requesting them to take their own rubbish out as they dump their alcohol empty bottles out in the beach and under the trees. Animals have left their foot prints only on the sand, beach and its so admirable while people leave their rubbish in a vergin jungle having a brain to think that it does not decay for centuries.

Other groups even seemed to have spotted a leopard. Also there were not too many Jeeps, at times it felt as if we were the only ones there. Furthermore the landscape alone is just stunning and varies a lot throughout the park.

It cost us LKR 4500 per person. We had 2 other couples as well as one subdue traveller with us on our jeep. I would say the shared option was really good as it was lighter on the pocket for us, while we also got to meet some fellow travellers. If you hire the jeep solo from Lemon Tree the quote was around LKR 14000. We were super pleased with Lemon Tree’s service all around. We asked around all the tour companies in Arugam Bay before finalising, and we found most of them either not transparent or not properly communicative. In particular the guy in Ceylon Walking tours lied to us overstating the government entree fees to the park as LKR 4500 (when its common knowledge that it’s arounf LKR 2200) and also lied to us that the pilgrimage season was in November even though it was happening then. Manas from Lemon Tree on the other hand came across as a very ethical salesperson staying everything transparently and not trying to increase prices for us even when we were in a rush towards the end. Lemon tree was also the only one who arranged shared trips; all other operators would only arrange singular trips and if you want to share you would’ve to find other travellers! The drive through Kumana National park was fun. We had quite a few close elephant sightings. Buffaloes, birds, deers and monkeys we sighted in the plentiful. I also had a fleeting glimpse at a leopard before the shy animal strode off into the brush. I can imagine why they say it’s a birder’s paradise. Even though I am not a bird watcher I found the sheer variety of birds amazing. One tip would be to avoid going on weekends though as the number of jeeps in the park would be relatively higher as the locals too would be in to watch the animals on their day off. But again it’s still way less crowded than any other park I have been to, so go for it if you can’t pick any other day.","July 10, 2018",0.0,0.0

Overall there are few reasons to be made this journey most attractive. First is the timing chosen for the Safari. It is January so that after having some rains whole park is in lush greenery. We started the journey from Arugam bay at about 2.30 pm and after about one hour travel we reached to the Kumana National park entrance. Total safari inside the park was about 3 hours from 3.30 to 6.30 pm so that it is one of the best time to see animals in kumana. Second reason; Kumana is still remain untouched by many visitors and Safari is not yet spoiled by lot of jeeps at once like in some other National parks in Sri Lanka. In some other parks it seems nos. Of jeeps are more than the animals in the park hence can not feel and enjoy the real Safari. In kumana, most attractively there are lot of animals and birds with many verities. Deers , elephants , wild bore, buffaloes , peacocks & many migrant birds, crocadiles and many others. Unforgettable climax point of the Safari is we were very lucky to see a leopard at very close distance. This is very rare opportunity in Sri Lanka and some travelers have to spend over night in camping site to eye catch such a scenery . So Kumana safari is recommended as one of the best safari in Sri Lanka .

A jeep with Ceylon Walking Tours cost 8,000LKR including driver and guide, and we split it among 4 people. The journey to the park entrance takes about 40 minutes. We arrived as the park opened up at 6am. Entrance for 4 tourists was 8600LKR, so 2150LKR each. As with everything else in Sri Lanka, it is much cheaper for locals, and you do get the feeling you are once again just subsidising their own domestic tourism industry, rather than supporting a good cause. The climate is noticeably cooler at this time of day. The park is enormous. We spent about 4 hours there in total, driving all the way to the river which divides it and Yala Strict Natural Reserve. Along the way we spotted one large and very surprised elephant, mongooses, deer, crocs, water buffalo and numerous wild bird species (although our guide informed us that we had missed the main migratory season to see all the bird life). All the while we were desperately looking for any sign of a leopard, straining our eyes up to every tree branch and rock we passed. However despite bumping along miles of track, all we saw were pawprints. Disappointing but given a park of this size where animals are also free to roam into Yala, understandable. It was a shame because we did feel we were mis-sold the trip a little, in that we were assured the morning would be a great time to spot leopards, and many visitors had seen them recently. Go with limited expectations, and a packed lunch, and you won't be disappointed!","June 24, 2017",0.0,0.0

There are leopards, crocodiles, sloth bears, elephants on the way and plenty of herds of deer and peacocks. Bring plenty of water and wear a comfortable clothing, the climate is fairly hot.

They walk from Okanda through the park to Kataragama. All of the animals go into hiding. When we visited the park it was a few days after this, and all of the animals were still in hiding.

Quit a long drive but well worth it. The best way to experience the park is camping, try to get a good reputed camping expert like Xtream tours, and enjoy the wilderness at its best. You will feel the difference as soon as you enter in to the park, no vehicles so late back, most of all no mobile coverage so you are one with the nature. In my experience you will see more leopards in Kumana than Yala, but they are very shy so don't get disheartened if they ran away. It's just that they are not used to vehicles that much. In May, I saw 4 leopards at once, so it's well worth the trip. Make sure to ask for a good guide from the Park office if you are travelling with your family, it's always better to talk to him and ask few basic questions about the park just to get an idea to assess him. Nearest hotels would be in Arugam bay about 40km from the park, so if you are staying there early drive would be the best. Park also have a bungalow (Thummulla) which can be reserved through the DWC (Department of Wildlife Conservation), if you are to book the same you need to plan a month ahead, further details pls access the department's official website. Thummulla bungalow is situated at a very good location, in front of a lake where you see loads of animal activities all day long. Clean place with real SriLankan authentic food.

Birders who visit the Park are usually amazed at the sheer diversity of species that call Kumana home mainly due to the presence of 20 lagoons and tanks. These tanks are generally less than 2 metres deep and are often flooded by seawater and are spread throughout the park. Many campsites are located close to the water tanks and the Kumbukkan Oya, which forms the Southern boundary of the national park. The favourite among the five sites is the Gal Amuna Camp Site, Which stands by a natural rock Dam across the Kumbukkan Oya. The site is vast and surrounded by Kumbuk trees and provides a front seat view of the animals ranging from a vast number of birds to deer, elephant and leopards coming to the river for a drink. The naturally formed pool provides a rare crocodile free bathing spot to the campers. Heraligas Ara and Madametota too stand near the Kumbukkan Oya but are not the ideal bathing spots due to current and crocodiles. Yet the camping sites amply provide for the lack of water sports and animals and birds gathering by the river during the night and morning are sure to keep campers awake. The two Eda Kumbuka camp sites, thus named for the famous twisted Arjun tree nearby, too face the Kumbukkan Oya and are two scenic sites situated few hundred meters apart. They offer many photographic opportunities, with or without animals, yet the proximity to the river means keeping a safe distance from the banks as the water level tends to record a sudden rise. The two river mouth camping sites, named for their closeness to the delta of Kumbukkan Oya occupies prized location between the river and the Indian Ocean and is ideal for bird watchers and turtle enthusiasts. The campsites, maintained by the Wildlife Department has to be pre-booked and a guide had to be secured while an off track vehicle is an essential due to state of the roads. However private campsite operators too function inside the Kumana Park and provide semi luxury and luxury camping options.","September 3, 2013",0.0,0.0
