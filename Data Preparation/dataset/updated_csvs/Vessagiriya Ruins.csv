By the first look we didn't understand the importance or at least the size of the place. Luckily we met a guide who gave us a very good explanation of this place. According to him, this place dates back even before era of King ""Devnam Piyatissa"" who supported and sponsored the spread of Buddhism in Sri Lanka. You can see man made caves which leave you confused how they were moved and how they were placed in the way they are now. And this is the only place I saw the unfinished stone work which always made me confused how the workmen in those days have produced buildings and statues with smooth surfaces. However the highlight of the place for me was the frescoes which looked identical to Sigiriya. You can also find a kings chamber too. If you are really interested of the place, I strongly suggest you to talk to a guide because this place is rarely mentioned with Sri Lankan history. The guide we met is Lal Mettasinghe (+94 703663123).","July 20, 2019",0.0,0.0
