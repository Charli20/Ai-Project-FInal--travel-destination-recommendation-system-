It is believed that the seven story palace of King Parakrambahu was set on fire by the armies of Chola dynasties about a thousand years ago. The thick walls with holes placed at regular intervals were used as reinforcements for he wooden beams which were supporting the seven storied palace. A well preserved staircase leading to no where is what is left of the upper floors. The high finish of the rooms can be visualized by highly polished wall plaster which is still visible. A must visit while you are in Polonnaruwa, Sri Lanka. Recommended.","October 1, 2025",0.0,0.0

Even though only the walls and foundations remain, you can feel how grand and powerful this place once was. The palace grounds are huge. The brick walls are thick and rise several meters high, and you can still see doorways, corridors, and the layout of rooms. It’s incredible to imagine that this place once had over 1,000 rooms! I found it fascinating how the palace was built with so much detail, despite being from the 12th century. The stone steps are beautifully crafted, and you’ll notice small carvings and architectural details if you look closely. The ticket counter is right near the palace, so it’s easy to start your exploration here. The staff were friendly and helpful in explaining where to go next. There’s plenty of shade from trees around the ruins, which makes walking around comfortable even on a hot day. And there’s a sense of peace — as if time has slowed down. If you love history, ancient architecture, and imagining life in a royal court, you absolutely shouldn’t miss this place. Tip: Bring water, wear comfortable shoes, and take your time exploring every corner. The details are what make it so special!","July 8, 2025",0.0,0.0
