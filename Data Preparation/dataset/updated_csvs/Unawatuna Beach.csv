The beaches are okay, but not really the hit. If you're lucky, you'll see big water turtles coming to the beach.

Unawatuna's one-kilometre beach stretched out in an arc. Its main advantage is the absence of a strong wave due to the double reef, which takes the shock load. The beach is good and profile. A gentle descent allows you to swim here with children, as well as people who are unable or poorly swim. That's probably why Unawatuna is popular with the local population, not just the Russians. Although the percentage of Sri Lankans able to swim seemed substantially higher than in India... However, the depths start at 10 or 15 meters. Another advantage of the beach is the availability of sunbeds. They're on display outside beach hotels and restaurants. You just have to grab drinks at the bar and use them all you want. Very convenient and cheap... We're into the Blue bistro restaurant.  Unawatuna is not yet imbued with the spirit of commerce like other resorts, so pressing with extras like boats, bananas, parasailing and so on is practically non-existent. That's a plus to me. You can swim safely... The central part of the beach is more interesting, although most of the vacationers are for some reason in the northern part, although there is not far from the river flow. Not very good smelling, by the way... Maybe it's because there's a lot of restaurants and a few hotels. One last thing. Apart from its main purpose, Unawatuna Beach is good with sunsets. They won't leave even emotionally restrained people indifferent. It's best to see here...","November 21, 2025",0.0,0.0

Not too many beach hassles.  Sea quite wavy but lovely to swim in. Two things spoilt it. Staff in Cormorant Beach cafe claimed we had only paid 1000 rupees when we had paid 2000.  Very hard to prove except a) why only notice several minutes later? b) why did they not chase after us when we left?  I cannot be sure but I think they were trying it on. When leaving we booked a cab with pickme, a hailing app which gets you the fair price not the tourist price.  A tuktuk driver, looking for a customer, told us that pickme would not come here.  I pointed out that we had come this way.  He said it was drop off only.  This seems a little odd.  When our ride did arrive, driver was accosted aggressively and told he wasn't allowed to be in that area. The guy hit the outside of the car violently with us and children inside. It looks like this is a place with some kind of syndicate going on with some dishonest restaurants to boot.

So as I headed to the coast from Ella, my first stop was Matara. From there to Mirissa and then onto Unawatuna. It was absolutely packed during the day. I was told the area is 93% Russian tourists. Even signs are in Russian. There’s a tower block hotel on the beach which is so unsightly compared with the landscape. I only stayed two nights before heading up the coast to Hikkadua. I really didn’t like Unawatuna. Locals try and trick you with over inflated prices. I liked Skinny Toms Delhi for food. My guesthouse was poor and just the general vibe I didn’t like.

Either way, it was an incredible disappointment. As my Tuk Tuk meandered its way along the narrow Main Street, all my fears were realised, however it depends what you are looking for. If you want a lively beach front resort that is rammed with tourists, all I might point out, Russian (no problem there depending on your politics), with endless tacky shops and bars and a busy beach, this is your place. You will only hear Russian spoken, all the signs and menus are in Russian which isn’t anything to particularly detract from the experience, everyone is very well behaved, it’s just a bit overwhelming. There is a tower block sized hotel that caters solely to this market and floods the town in the evening. I had a little hotel on the outskirts of the town so didn’t have to deal with the very loud bars and restaurants nearer the centre which might be problematic to some people. My main concern was the pollution. Whilst the main town beach is fairly clean, the beaches at the Dutch watering hole and Jungle beach, are less clean unfortunately. Both beaches have precarious paths to them that are not for the faint hearted, on either beach there are sun beds for a minimal amount and a restaurant. The disheartening thing is that the paths to both beaches is strewn with rubbish, piles and piles of it. I really don’t understand why someone doesn’t organise a clean up, it’s absolutely filthy. The beach and sea at DWP is cleaner than at Jungle Beach which has a lot of rubbish floating in the sea. Not my idea of fun. Having booked to stay a week, my initial horror died down a bit on the second day and because my hotel was quiet and clean decided to,use the place as a base for scootering around but only for 5 days. Hopefully I’ll find some less hectic places down the coast which, if I return will be preferable to Sri Lanka’s answer to certain resorts in Majorca but then again, it’s snowing at home and 30 degrees here….","November 21, 2024",0.0,0.0

I wouldn't mind that if it wasn't for the fact that tourists from this specific country are ruining the island. Of course there is good people and bad people everywhere, but I haven't seen other foreigners (from other countries) doing any of the following things: throwing rocks at dogs and laughing, removing corals from the sea into the land or throwing empty bottles of alcohol into the ocean. The behavior of these tourists is just unacceptable. Instead of seeing locals defending their area, we see them supporting this type of stuff/behavior. It's very sad to see this. We know Sri Lanka is in desperate need of tourism, but this type of tourism will destroy beautiful places. They get drunk and ruin your experience with their drunkenness.  I hope the police starts patrolling the beach and making tourists have some respect for the public areas.

Even you don't need to book a room here if you are not staying a night. if you want to swim for a couple of hours here, you can park your car at a nearby hotel , 300LKR car park charges and then take a meal from the bar/restaurant near the temple and you can have free shower after sea swim. Otherwise, it will be 50LKR. not bad. diving is great near the ""Aluth gala"" area. Discovery will cost around 5000/-LKR. Don't spend beyond that. Romantic activities in the beach: Well, actually it's illegal since this is a public place. But it's quite okay if children and not too much crowded. This is a little bit crowded beach, if you are looking for a less crowded beach, then you may find it near Hikkaduwa. Not a good beach for romantic activities but great for swimming.","November 14, 2021",0.0,0.0

My ideal beach has no undertow or current and is deep enough to swim as if you are in a swimming pool. Unawatuna beach ticks those boxes. It is a bay protected by a reef that keeps the dangerous current of the Indian Ocean out. It is actually one of the few beaches in Sri Lanka where you can swim without getting drowned. The safest side is towards the temple. There the water is even suitable for small children. When you swim from the temple towards the main road you feel when the waves get stronger. There will be no undertow, but the waves will be too strong to swim pleasant swimming pool like laps. The downside of the Unawatuna beach is that all the boats are floating in the part that is most suitable for swimming! You will have to swim around these boats or worse inhale the petrol fumes! How can tourist enjoy the freshness of the sea air when the have to inhale stinking petrol! The beach is for Sri Lankan standards wide. Non swimming tourists like to enjoy this beach to lie in the sun or drink cocktails. This beach is however completely artificial. The municipality puts this sand which is different from real beach sand. The sea erodes this sand and then more sand needs to be put to keep the beach. The result is a smaller bay to swim and less clear water due to the eroding sand floating on the water!","August 13, 2019",0.0,0.0

Lovely beach to walk along and to jump in the waves. Be careful though as there is a strong current in some places. The beach has beach bars and restaurants and I can see it being a hive of activity in the peak season months.  We opted to have drinks and a snack at The Lucky Tuna and they allowed us to use their sunloungers for free. I would have given the beach a 5, but the number of people offering massages, surfing, diving, clothes, hair braiding, bracelets, sarongs, jewellery, coconuts and stories of the tsunami ..... well with the list of things offered you can see it was not relaxing. They were relentless with the same people asking time and time again. I am always polite, but did finally have to ask them to go away as I was not interested. I know they are desperate for sales, but pestering people deters them...well in my case it does. Beautiful beach though and we enjoyed our day.","August 8, 2019",0.0,0.0

Also  i was horrified to see a dreadful monolith of a hotel being built at the end of unawatuna beach at least 12 stories high and easily visible from Galle and dalawella. The locals are horrified too... apparently it is a vanity project initiated by the president's son and such a shame as nothing else exceeds the height of a palm tree.

There are dozens of shady bars and restaurants along the back of the beach where you can go for lunch and dinner (they move extra tables out onto the sand at night so you can dine on the beach at night). There is a narrow village street that runs from the beach up to the main road that has lots of restaurants, bars, shops etc, which for us was a highlight of the place. If you stay at Calamander Beach Resort they do not tell about this street and if you don’t know where it is, it is possible that you can stay at Unawatuna beach for a week and not even know that it is there, so make sure you find it! (You can walk through to the village street from some of the other hotels, such as Tartaruga Hotel & restaurant, you walk through the driveway, turn left and right along a few short laneways and then you pop out into the middle of the village!). We loved this village, there are good rooftop bars such as The hideout, and good restaurants such as the Happy Spice, which is down the lane way behind the Pink Elephant (another good restaurant), and the Shifting Sands. We stayed at Calamander Beach Resort and although our rooms were pretty good, the service was underwhelming, meals took far too long so the restaurants were not busy, and we think there were better (and probably better value) places to stay that are also on the beachfront or in/near the village, with a very short walk to the beach. We stayed in 6 different hotels in Sri Lanka and we rated Calamander as the lowest in terms of value for money and service. But we loved Unawatuna both as a beach and a village, thoroughly recommend staying there.","January 26, 2019",0.0,0.0
