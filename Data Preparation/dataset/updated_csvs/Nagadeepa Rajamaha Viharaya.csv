The calm surroundings and well-maintained premises offer a refreshing escape from the busy city atmosphere. The religious importance of Nagadeepa Temple is deeply rooted in Buddhist history, as it is believed that Lord Buddha visited this sacred site to settle a dispute between two Naga tribes over a gem-studded throne (gem chair). This historical event adds great spiritual value and meaning to the visit. At present, the road from the vehicle parking area to the ferry point is still under expansion, with construction work actively ongoing. While there may be minor inconvenience, access is manageable, and the improvements will greatly enhance visitor convenience in the future. Ferry services operate according to a scheduled timetable, so visitors are advised to plan their trip accordingly. For those seeking flexibility, private boat services are available at approximately Rs. 5,000 per one-way trip. The ferry journey itself adds a scenic and memorable element to the experience. Overall, Nagadeepa Temple is a must-visit when traveling to Jaffna, ideal for travelers seeking spiritual insight, cultural richness, and a peaceful atmosphere. We truly enjoyed our visit and highly recommend it.","January 2, 2026",0.0,0.0

This holy Buddhist temple, located on the serene island of Nagadeepa, is steeped in history and spiritual significance. According to legend, the temple marks the site where the Buddha himself visited Sri Lanka during his second journey to settle a dispute between two Naga kings. This makes Nagadeepa one of the most revered pilgrimage sites for Buddhists in the country. We began our journey from Jaffna, driving to the Kurikadduwan jetty. From there, we took a ferry to reach the island. The ferry service is frequent and well-organized, with ferries departing regularly throughout the day. The ride itself was smooth and offered beautiful views of the surrounding waters, making the journey to the temple a pleasant experience. Travel Tip: For a peaceful and crowd-free experience, we recommend arriving at the Kurikadduwan jetty by 7:30 AM to catch the first ferry. This allows you to reach the temple early in the day, avoiding the crowds that arrive later. By doing so, you can worship and explore the area at a leisurely pace and return before the heat and humidity become too intense. The temple grounds are beautifully maintained, with a tranquil atmosphere that invites reflection and meditation. We spent time exploring the temple and its surroundings, taking in the sacred ambiance and learning about the rich history of the site. The local devotees and temple staff were welcoming and offered insights into the temple's significance. Overall, our visit to Nagadeepa Rajamaha Viharaya was a peaceful and spiritually uplifting experience. We highly recommend it to anyone visiting the Jaffna region, as it offers a unique glimpse into Sri Lanka's deep Buddhist heritage.","August 20, 2024",0.0,0.0

The boat was crowded.  Every passenger was required to wear a life jacket provided by the boat.  These were less than clean after many uses!  The cost of the boat ride was Rs 40 per person. We landed at the jetty leading to Nagadeepa Buddhist temple. The other second main jetty leads to Naga Pooshani Amman Hindu temple. The main attraction is the stupa.  Unlike other stupas this is painted in silver to protect its limestone-based construction from the salty winds.  The elegantly built main shrine room is on the far side of the stupa.  The bo-tree on the seaside is surrounded by a fence, with posts painted golden.  The buddha statue guarded by seven cobra heads is attractive and striking.  The beautifully drawn mural near the bo tree illustrates the commonly believed historical event, where buddha, settled a dispute between two warring kings of Naga (snake) tribe advocating compassion and non-violence.  Hence The name “Nagadeepa” comes from the “Naga” (Snake) people who inhabited this island. The three storeyed building behind the main shrine room, in its second floor, houses a museum.  On the open hall in the third floor is another Buddha statue, and a small bronze stupa said to contain small piece of Buddha's bone. There were many devotees paying their respects at the temple, considered to be one of the most sacred Buddhist places of worship in Sri Lanka. Although Nagadeepa has a long-chronicled history dating back to 100 AD, much of the old temple had been destroyed badly during the colonial era. What we now see are reconstructed and new structures built after 1940. After visiting the Nagadeepa temple we walked along the motorable road linking Buddhist temple and the Hindu Kovil. Many stalls on either side of the road sell shells, fruits, sweets etc. Nagadeepa temple, situated in the Jaffna Peninsula was not accessible to Buddhist Sinhalese in the south during the 30 year old civil war.  Buddhists now visit here in large numbers to pay their respects to this temple, said to have been visited by Budddha himself.","July 16, 2019",0.0,0.0

The Nagadeepa Purana Rajamaha Viharaya is one of the sixteen most sacred places of worship by the Buddhists in Sri Lanka. Pilgrims have been coming to the Nagadeepa since about the 1st century AC to worship at its famous Rajayathana stupa. The Rajayathana stupa was constructed by two warring Naga kings, Chulodara and Mahodara, at the site where Lord Buddha during His second visit to the country on a Bak Maha Amawaka Poya Day, five years after attaining Enlightenment, intervened and mediated in settling a dispute over the possession of a gem-studded throne. The precious throne was offered to the lord Buddha, was returned to the Naga Kings and was later enshrined in this Rajayathana stupa. History records that the Nagadeepa Purana Rajamaha Vharaya was developed and reconstructed by pious kings, Devanampiyatissa, Dutugemunu and converted into a fully accomplished sacred place. During the period of Portuguese, Dutch and British all the Buddhist religious places were destroyed and the Nagadeepa Viharaya too has been subjected to it and Buddhists were deprived of worshiping these religious places. In the year 1931 Ven. Randombe Somatissa Nayake Thero from Ambalangoda has visited this place and observed the ruins of the Rajayathana stupa and the Kiripalu Nuga tree and identified as the stupa constructed with the gem studded throne on which Lord Buddha has preached, and Thero then reconstructed this stupa with the support of donors to enabling Buddhists for their religious observances. Praveenacharya Damma Kiththi Sri Venerable Navadagala Paduma Kiththi Tissa Thero the Chief Sanganayake of the Northern Province is the present chief Incumbent of Nagadeepa Purana Raja Maha Viharaya and he is a pupil of former chief Incumbent Rajakeeya Panditha the Late Most Venerable Brahmmana Watte Damma Kiththi Tissa Nayake Thero of Amarapura Nikaya. The Nagadeepa Purana Rajamaha Viharaya is a shining example of inter racial harmony in Sri lanka and this had been improved at various stages and ever since it has become the most sanctified place of worship by the devotees.","November 26, 2016",0.0,0.0
