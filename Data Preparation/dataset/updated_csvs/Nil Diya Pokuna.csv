This is the perfect adventure and isn't too long either all whilst being one of the most unique experiences you can have on earth and the pool at the end was spectacular.  We had it all to ourselves as well. Overall highly recommend to anyone . Maybe not if you're into adventures or are not able to climb a ladder for 30 seconds lol.","December 5, 2024",0.0,0.0

He moved so quickly we couldn’t keep up and showed no consideration.  We got the sense he was annoyed he had to take us. At one point when I fell he didn’t even pause to check if I was ok. The cave might have been beautiful, I’m not sure, the walk/climb in and out were so rushed I didn’t have a chance to look up. The path is a bit of a scramble in places and quite slippery, but manageable. The pool at the end is nice, and they hold up a light so you can swim. We also found out after the fact that they charged us almost double the actual price. If you do go, make sure you haggle hard.","August 22, 2024",0.0,0.0

If you’re planning a trip, this place should definitely be on your list. Our guide, Harshana, was exceptionally friendly and thorough. The tour costs 1500 Rs per person, which is a great value for a lifetime experience. If you’re visiting with a group, the price per person decreases. The best time to visit is in the morning. After a 500-meter walk through a forest reserve, we reached what seemed like a rabbit hole—the entrance to the cave. Headlamps are provided. From the entrance, we descended 10 meters via ladders. Initially, we encountered a large cave that led us to the Nil Diya Pokuna (Blue Water Pond). The water in the pond is refreshingly cool and its level rises on rainy days. The cave tour lasts about 1.5 hours. Facilities include a small public washroom and a dress-changing area near to the ticketing office. We also discovered silver dust and shimmering graphite deposits in some rocks. Be prepared for sharp rocks and note that the cave can be muddy and slippery.","August 12, 2024",0.0,0.0

It was hard, but absolutely magnificent! The guides were very good and patient. An absolute must do! The caves are enigmatic and dark. The head torch that you carry as a crown leads your footsteps, but nothing prepares you to the steep paths and climbs. The mud makes it slippery and extremely challenging at times, but arriving  at the bottom is worth the fight.

If you want to go somewhere adventurous without flashy lights and infrastructure, this is great - I went during the end of rainy season and was worried about the cave flooding, but it totally wasn't, it's incredibly deep and people are going in and out of the cave every day, so my fear quickly went away - in my opinion, the two ladders to enter are the most claustrophobic parts. After that, everything opens up a lot. So do not worry about having to squeeze in any small spaces. If you can do the ladders you'll be fine. It's very roomy in there - guide is ESSENTIAL A few word of warnings: - there are bats and small flies in there, but if you hold your torch in your hand they really won't bother you - the water isn't a super clear blue during rainy season, so manage your expectations - our guide didn't have great English, but clearly knew the route and we felt safe with him - your clothes will get filthy and you will sweat!","January 14, 2024",0.0,0.0

The Sri Lankans running the show are just a below average example of their customer service and ability to give tourist a great experience. Details: Three of us (men, slim and above avarage fitness) paid 3000 LKR each for entry. Not sure but they probably would not let you in without a guide. That is a very high price for what they provide. The seller of tickets had decent english, gave us info about the tour and safety instructions. All good. We got helmets and embarked on a short hike to the cave entrance. Our guide made only little effort at conversation as his english was pretty poor. Some questions were only answered with yes because he struggled to understand. It is very hot inside the cave so be ready for some sauna. Also there are annoying flies, dripping water and bat excrements everywhere. You will end up dirty. The caving itself is not that hard. The smallest part is the second ladder from the entrance. Only once after that you have to partially crawl. The cave is fairly big with interesting layers of different colored rock. However it is hard to see this as the personal light on helmets are not very powerful and the guide's big torch isn't strong enough either. This is where they could make the experience so much better - bringing a better torch or getting electricity into the cave to light things up. I give them the benefit of doubt that perhaps they don't want to do that to preserve natural habitat for the bats or something like that. In our case (end of rainy season - 2nd December) the water in the cave was too high so swimming was not allowed.","December 3, 2023",0.0,0.0

If you are around don't miss this. You will swallow some flies, walk over bat poop on your way down, which has no illumination but your headlamp (keep it in your hand as the flies will approach the light), and many rocks.

If you’re to big you cannot enter the cave. You should bring a headlamp or hire a guide like we did, the price includes the headlamps. Climbing into this totally raw cave through a small hole on a rope fixed to a tree (!) was one of the coolest things I ever did. Not knowing what was waiting for me I went there in flipflops and a white shirt. It took me only two seconds to find out that this was not the best choice because even the small entrance hole is very dirty and wet already. A big group right before us led to heavy traffic jam. You climb down using the knotted rope, than a steep ladder that’s missing every other step and finally crawl through a small way into the main cave. Than you can move more freely but be careful, it is really slippery. The cave is home to a lot of bats making noises in the far corners, sometimes flying over your head. When stomping the ground you realize that you are walking on mountains of their poop - but it’s to late because you already used your hands a lot:) The guides jump around like mountain goats with their flip flops but I wouldn’t do that at all because I did not see any rescue equipment at all, not even a pulley ore a rescue harness to get an injured person out through the cave entrance. So if you would break a leg down there you would be waiting a very long time until a professional rescue teams arrival. The cave descends 700 meters down until you reach a beautiful little lake. Some people were jumping in and had a swim. Then you leave the cave on the same way that you crawled in - dirty and happy. Just wow!!! Bring good shoes and move slowly. 4 stars because of the missing rescue equipment and the old rope that they use. That’s definitely something they should improve on.","January 18, 2022",0.0,0.0

It’s bit scary sometimes when you go down. Must take a guide with you. It’s impossible to find your way on your own. The initial bit was the toughest as it is a direct descend for about 50m. Guide puts a rope also to help the climb down. There after the path is fine and you’ll be amazed by the size of the cave system. The initial half is very muddy and filled with bat poop. You must strictly follow the foot steps of the guide since if something goes wrong no one knows where you’ll end up. Within about 45mins you can reach the pond. And you will be out of words once you see the crystal clear water surface. Do not try this if you are faint hearted as it is a very mysterious feeling you get once you are inside. Bathing at the pond is also not recommended as there are plenty of unknowns and if something happens you are 200 ft directly below the surface and no one would be able to reach out to help you in a short time. Be careful and focus on your path and you will be quite fine. Must do thing in Sri Lanka for sure.,"March 4, 2021",0.0,0.0

It is pitch dark in the cave without the head LAMPS. The cave guides will provide you with cave lamps and a rope. The water down there is cold and fresh. It was difficult to guage the depth and distance of water. I didn't swim accross. Since I was warned not to. The descent it self is dangerous with lose rock and slippery conditions. At some narrow points a fall would mean certain death. Wear cargo pants or trekking/ out door pants. The cave can be explored bare foot or wearing  trekking shoes.

If you’re planning to go down the tunnel, remember to take torch, preferably a head torch, (you need a powerful one since it’s pitch black down) proper footwear and a head net if possible because some days it’s swamped with little fly thingys. And be ready for bats lots and lots of them. But you should be fine, if you’re careful enough not to alarm them. And don’t carry anything other than what you really need because at the beginning the tunnel is really small and it could get tricky to carry backpacks. And last but not least you need a guide for this, tunnel is huge and dangerous as one side of the path is straight down the steep rocks walls and If prepared, you will enjoy this thrilling journey to the fullest.","January 3, 2020",0.0,0.0

A better depiction of this hell hole would’ve been a photo of a million flies flying into a persons nose, eyes, ears, and mouth while they’re covered in mud and bat poop, accompanied with a photo of the murkiest vomit and snot-infused pond ever to taint our otherwise beautiful earth. Unfortunately, we were adventurous and gullible enough to fall for the brochure’s marketing tactics, and we went to this decrepit, godforsaken place. After walking through a wilderness trail for about 15 min, we arrived at the entrance to Satan’s playground aka Nil Diya Pokuna. It was a deep, small hole with a muddy rope leading into a black vortex of despair that you couldn’t see the end of with your headlamp. We lowered ourselves in with the rope and arrived at the first landing into the cave. Our guide began lowering himself to the next landing, using a moldy ladder with fungus that was bound to consume the wood at any moment and lead its user to a muddy, perhaps lethal fall. As I peered down to follow him, I saw hundreds, thousands, millions, perhaps billions of tiny flies occupying every square inch of air space through the rest of the cave. They were, most certainly and undoubtedly, the spawn of Satan himself. My instinct was like “NOT TODAY, SATAN,” but I didn’t want to be a bad sport since we had already come this far so I decided to bite the bullet and climb down to the next landing. I should’ve listened to my instinct. The next 40 minutes of my life were likely the most tormented minutes of my human existence. There were no more ropes, ladders, or light. We continued to climb, squeeze, and jump through dangerous holes, crevices, and jagged boulders that were all covered in slippery mud and bat poop all while being attacked by tiny flies that attempted, and succeeded, to enter every available opening in our face. The bats were screeching in excitement above us, probably rubbing their greedy hands together in drooling expectation of the three warm-blooded mammals that would comprise their next meal if Satan were so kind enough as to have one rock collapse and block our one and only exit point from the cave of hell. Spiders the size of a human hand were equally as excited, staring at us hungrily because the gigantic roaches and crickets that also lived here were becoming too small of meals for their ever-growing eight legs. They leered ominously from every rock that I almost put my hand on for support, after which I would gasp with shock, fear, and relief; for each time I knew I had escaped a poisonous death by fangs of Satan’s favorite insect. I wanted to leave many times, I didn’t give a damn about this stupid pond from the moment I saw the flies (it was like a premonition, I knew the worst was yet to come), but my friend kept saying “we must be close now” and the guide spoke no English, so every time I asked how much longer he just pointed in the direction we were walking. Satan’s helper he was; the flies didn’t even seem to bother him while I gagged and blew fly-infused boogers out of my nose behind him the entire trek. When we finally arrived at the pond, I laughed. We ventured through hell to find Satan’s bathtub, floating with Satan’s grime. The water was vaguely reminiscent of the color blue, if blue lost all of its vivacity and beauty, and were instead replaced with a clouded sea of lost and hopeless souls, sealed in their watery grave by an opaque grey film. Surely nobody but the devil himself would consider entering this liquid filth. As we made our way out of the hell hole, I prayed for our safety and the stability of the rocks so that we wouldn’t be caved in and I might breathe fresh air once again. But I didn’t dare speak these prayers aloud, for fear of giving Satan any ideas. We finally made it out and I vowed to never enter another evil cave again in my life, and to share my experience so as to save other adventurous, daring, and naive tourists from the clutches of Satan.","December 18, 2019",0.0,0.0
