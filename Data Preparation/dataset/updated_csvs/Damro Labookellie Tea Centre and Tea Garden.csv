We went to the Damro factory and after a tour where they explained to us how they make the tea, we had a tea tasting. Both things were good so we decided to buy some boxes of tea to bring home. In particular, I bought one box of Damro Labookellie Cinammon tea and another of Chai tea. Recently, we opened the tea and we were badly surprised by the bad quality of the tea. They don't have taste neither aroma. We felt scammed.","January 3, 2026",0.0,0.0

While the factory visit was interesting, it was shorter than expected. At the end, only one type of tea was offered for tasting, it would have been much better to sample a variety of teas, especially given Sri Lanka’s rich tea heritage. The scenery is beautiful, but the overall experience could be improved with a slower, more engaging tour and a broader tea tasting.","December 29, 2025",0.0,0.0

I had a very disappointing experience at Damro Tea Factory. I was served a cake that was clearly expired, which completely ruined the visit and raised serious concerns about food safety. When I brought this to the attention of the staff, the supervisor, Thushara, handled the situation very poorly. There was no proper apology, accountability, or effort to resolve the issue. This level of negligence and unprofessional customer service is unacceptable for a well-known establishment like Damro. I strongly urge management to take immediate action to improve food quality control and customer service standards. ATTENTION MANAGEMENT: Unprofessional customer service by THUSHARA (Supervisor) you’re about to lose many chauffuer guides and tourists.","December 23, 2025",0.0,0.0

The emphasis on the name of the tea brand seems to have changed  from being Damroo to Labookellie. The original brand name was Mackwood Labookellie Tea Estate which is about a century old tea brand. The place is crowded with foreigners and the parking lot was too hot with  no tree for shade. The overstretched staff were busy with their hands full. It took considerable time to draw the attention of the staff. The smile from the sales staff is missing. Free pastry and tea were provided for the visitors. The packaging of the tea has improved with airtight containers. The price of the packaged teas have also been considerably jacked up. The company seems to be going in the reverse direction by increasing the  tea prices many fold  while the janatha is clamoring for reduction in prices. Instead of buying good quality but over priced tea packets from the show room, visitors could also explore the other tea show rooms in the vicinity like Rothschilds, Oakray Tea Bush, Ramboda for alternatives. The company could also explore reverting to the original name Mackwood Tea brand if IPR licenses are still held by the present owners. Expensive.","September 18, 2025",0.0,0.0

Don’t spend your travel time budget on this one. My Sri Lankan partner and I (aka the foreigner) visited for a tea tour. After a 15 min wait for the guide we went on a tour that took 15 mins at most. We listened to some scripted information about tea and found ourselves seated next to the shop with a promise of a cup of tea and an invitation to buy. No discussion, no questions invited, no explanation of why the ‘tour’ did not hit advertised targets. A guy quickly poured tea and was gone. No explanation; I don’t know what we drank. Boxes of tea were about $50. We left and spoke to a local guide. He said that he’d overheard staff say it was busy so they should cut our group quickly and get onto the next one. He reported complaints from multiple customers of his. He also said that foreigners get free entry because they’re likely to buy stuff at the shop. Locals get charged entry because they’re considered less likely to spend at the shop. We didn’t pay.  I’d say they need an overhaul of their customer treatment practices.

From the moment we arrived, the staff consistently directed their attention only to my boyfriend, who is Western, and completely ignored me. At reception, the woman arranging the tea tour asked only about my boyfriend’s nationality and spoke solely to him, despite both of us standing there. During the factory tour, another staff member again asked only about his background—and not mine—while asking other couples (including a Nepali couple) where they were from. Later, in the tea room, the waiter brought the menu and asked only my boyfriend if he wanted to order anything. When he declined, the menu was taken away without even acknowledging me. It felt as though I was invisible. This kind of behavior from a well-known tea brand is incredibly disappointing. No one should feel disregarded or devalued based on their ethnicity or the nationality of their partner. I sincerely hope the management reflects on this and improves their staff training to ensure a more respectful and inclusive experience for all visitors.","July 22, 2025",0.0,0.0

Except for Planter's, the other teas are powder. If I wanted to buy this kind of tea I could go to a Cargills and save a lot of money.

All followed by a (again free) tea tasting. On the road to Nuwara Eliya from this facility you can see some of the 600+ ladies employed as tea pickers across the 1200 acre estate. Makes you appreciate hard work - these folk have to pick 18kg of tips each / day!,"January 18, 2024",0.0,0.0

As soon as I entered I wasn't allowed to have a cup of tea as I need some sort of membership that costs Rs 1,500. I was a bit disappointed as I wanted to try and buy some silver tip tea and the only way to do is to pay the fee.  It was a bit embarassing as I took a seat and then get up and walk out. They need to put a ticket counter so that people entering the tea room could buy the ticket first.  Very disappointed as in the past I never paid any money to have a cup of tea. You probably need to pay for the cup of silver tea on top of this fee.  Will never go there.

We had our tuk tuk driver take us there, Upon arrival, a hostess will meet you and ask if you would like to go on an excursion. for 15,000 rupees (€43, 3 of us) we received a 20-minute tour with explanation in the factory and then an hour-long safari through the plantation where we could pick ourselves and the ladies at work could see. The lady who gave the explanation had a terribly annoying voice so I quickly dropped out. She explained the process itself very well and you could see how they worked behind glass. Then we went for a cup of tea in the tearoom before being picked up for the tour. The boy who served us asked if we wanted black tea and if we wanted a piece of cake. I asked if I could drink green tea and I was the only one who wanted a piece of cake. He didn't say anything about it costing money and there was no menu on the table so I thought it was part of our tour. Until the bill arrived that included my green tea and cake. I said I wasn't going to pay it because nothing was said. Our tuk tuk driver came to pick us up to say he was joining us for the ride. Very nice, I thought. Then he doesn't have to wait so long. Got up and went outside. We set off in a comfortable jeep-like car with an open roof. We drove up between the tea fields. We were given a tea leaf in our hands and were allowed to help pick what one of the ladies was doing. we were given a basket on our backs to put the tea leaves in and left our backpacks in the car. I don't know if our tuk tuk driver conspired with the tour driver but they went into our backpacks. They opened our front pockets for me and my son. Afterwards I missed my beautiful pocket knife and my son had €50 taken from his wallet. My daughter and I both had a bag with our money in it, so they couldn't reach it. We only found this out at the hotel. The ladies who work for this company have to pick 20 kg per day and then receive €3.50. We saw them dragging the heavy bags while tourists (us) drive past them in a car. Let them use those cars to transport the tea. This looks like slave labor. It was a worthless trip that didn't last an hour and for which we paid too much money. We might as well have driven up in our tuk tuk. When I returned I asked for my money back. I was unable to speak to a manager and did not get my money back. After all, we had already had the excursion. I left pissed. While we were on our way, our tuk tuk driver received a phone call. They called because the bill for the tea and cake had not yet been paid. I said again that I am not going to pay for it. So, watch your stuff when you go picking and you now know not to have another tea and cake if you don't feel like paying extra.","December 11, 2023",0.0,0.0

Too touristy and staff are not interested and not personal. Biggest regret as Sri Lanka are filled with many nice places and people. Damro staff are more interested in selling than service. In Dec 2019 before the onset of Covid19, I was personally guided around the tea plantation by a fair local girl that gave me the impression very blankly that she did NOT want to be there at all. I asked for permission to take picture of the tea process and accidentally had a picture of her looking nonchalant and sulky inside my picture! A picture paints a thousand word! have since submitted my feedback to my travel agent who checks in on my mum and I everyday. This same girl’s face only lighted up very slightly when my mum and I started purchasing many teas. Another incident that disappoints me was the complimentary black tea which we declined as it was already mid afternoon and we were afraid that the caffeine will affect our sleep when we arrive at Nuwara Eliya. Thus we requested for chamomile or peppermint tea that they said coat Sri Lankan Rupees 700  (USD3.80) which was not expensive but the tea arrived COLD! This is an abomination to a lovely country that prides itself as a top tea country! It was a rainy day in the hills and that was the last thing my poor old mum needed. Very disappointed with the entire experience! I would avoid all the “touristy” restaurants with big tour buses as we were on a private tour as the guide will have a tendency to bring the tourists there for reasons we all know why... so do your homework and have your travel agent give you a detailed itinery as to where to eat etc..we had a wonderful travel agent and I shall visit Sri Lanka again just NEVER to return to DAMRO!","July 22, 2020",0.0,0.0

The picked leaves are placed in huge belts to dry where huge air blowers blow air to aid in the drying process.  This takes about 14 hours of drying. It takes 5 kg fresh leaves to make 1 kg of black tea. Once the leaves are dried they are sent down to the machine where it's rolled and cut as per the requirements.  Then they are placed on the table for fermentation where the process of oxidation changes the colour of the tea leaves. No fermentation for green and white tear.  Then the leaves are sent to the Dryer machine to stop fermentation to turn to black colour.  After this they are sent to the Grading machine for different quality of grading - strong, medium, light.  The tour ends with complimentary light black tea. For the huge acres of tea estate and the fact that it's a factory the rates should've been cheaper than the markets. Was very surprised to see such expensive rates.","December 23, 2019",0.0,0.0

However, it's still not a huge operation and the walk-through therefore does not take a lot of time - about 30 minutes gets it done. You peer at the operations through glas walls. Nevertheless, i learned quite a bit about tea. The Twining's Orange Pekoe I drink is a milder form of English breakfast black tea etc. This tea factory sends its product to the merchants in Colombo for distribution and export. The capital is also where flavours, such as peppermint are added. The factory does not do any of the flavouring that is the basis for all the options we see in our supermarkets. Of course, the tour inevitably stops in the shop, which is the only place in which you can buy Damro Labookellie tea under its own label. Of course, we bought samples - BOP and BOPF.

Pickers work on the tea terraces around the location and the tea making process is well demonstrated within a ""mini"" factory environment. Tea is served free of charge after the tour, a cake is available at a very small charge. There is a gift shop selling tea, but you are perfectly free to exit the facility without visiting the shop, which is on the opposite side of the building from the exit. Our tour guide spoke excellent English and was very knowledgeable when asked questions. We definitely learned something about the different kinds and grades of tea. It is what it is, It is what it is, but if you want to know how tea is made, then this a free attraction worth visiting.","May 11, 2019",0.0,0.0

The Damro factory is buzzing with tour groups and families delivered by tuk-tuks and taxis. The tour through the factory is interesting, and you can learn a lot about the process. You get a cup of tea at the end (you don't choose which type), and you'll be offered a slice of chocolate cake to go with it. The tea is free, the cake isn't. They won't divulge that until later. It seems pretty likely that tuk tuk and taxi drivers get commissions from the tea shop inside, since the drivers strongly encourage you to buy some tea before you leave. And they hang out in the store to make sure you get that purchase through.","April 16, 2019",0.0,0.0

It was recommended by several tuktuk drivers and our homestay host. The tour was complimentary and lasted about 20 minutes, as we walked through the factory. We visited on New Year so there were no leaves being blow-dried. Our guide looked tired and recited off a script. She did nonetheless entertain our pesky questions well. After the tour we got to taste a cup each of FF1 tea in the lounge, but sadly we weren’t particularly impressed. Strangely, there wasn’t the option to try other types of tea - we would have wanted to try the loose leaf types like OP and BOP which we later discovered were more to our liking. We were, funnily enough, allowed to buy cakes, which admittedly were cheap and decent. Ultimately, as we had liked our host’s tea, which was from damro, we proceeded to make the mistake of buying too much tea on our first stop. It was only after visiting the Mackwoods museum in Nuwara Eliya’s city centre that we found out more about the history of Damro - it was a furniture company that had just (as of 2016) ventured into the plantation business, acquiring great swathes of land, including the Labookellie tea lounge, and a significant stake in the Mackwoods brand (the second oldest tea company after the parent company of Lipton). Make what you will of our experience - we still can’t figure out if we are happy with our purchases 4 days later. But the experience as a whole was somewhat uncanny. The price of tea in the gift shop we found to be average - higher than the Zesta / Lipton types in supermarkets but lower than most single-estate tea companies we visited elsewhere in Sri Lanka. Our advice would be to stay off the teabags (which we tasted and found to be quite ordinary) and stick to the loose leaf teas.","April 15, 2019",0.0,0.0
