We were expertly guided by Raj Fernando, of Leopard Trails. He has deep and detailed knowledge of the wildlife. We like to learn as much as we can about the nature and wildlife around, and Raj thoroughly impressed us with his knowledge. He is also a most gracious person, very well organised and service oriented, nothing was too much for him and our expert driver Dinesh. We saw leopard, elephant, bear, wild boar, crocs, and many many bird species. Just a glance at a distant spot was enough for Raj to identify a bird and tell us all about the species. Thanks to Raj and Dinesh, visiting Wilpattu national park was an unforgettable experience, a treasure not to be missed.","November 26, 2025",0.0,0.0

Having done 2 safari tours in Sri Lanka thus far we travelled to Wilpatu for a short stay near the Wilpatu national park. The town is dead with really nothing to do outside the hotel. We had booked a full day safari which in my opinion was a big mistake. Take my advice & opt for 2 to 4 hours experience if you choose this activity. The terrain is expectedly extremely harsh so after bouncing up & down for 10 hours my body is now rather suffering. Don’t get me wrong our guide was brilliant & if the animals were there to spot he spotted them. The trouble is, & it may have just been a bad day that there weren’t that many to spot so sometimes sightings were an hour apart. Additionally the guides/drivers for some reason have to stop & chat everytime they pass each other. I get they want to share if they’ve spottted anything so others can enjoy but with over 70 vehicles buzzing round this space & stopping every time they pass each other even if they’ve passed each other 10 times previously it starts to become a little infuriating. This does however give you the opportunity to observe your fellow safari goers faces in the other vehicles which pretty much all had expressions of extreme boredom. There is impressive wildlife in the park so like I said if you choose to visit just do a short tour.","August 24, 2025",0.0,0.0

Leopards and bears are for sale, but neither was seen. There are about 6 leopards in the area where the Jeep is going. After breakfast, we got word of a leopard and headed there, but it was already a long traffic jam and the leopard was gone while we waited. Except for leopards and bears, most of them can be found just driving around normally, so I think it would be good if they specialized in leopard hunting. Don't seem happy with peacocks. Beautiful little birds to check out. As usual, monkeys are found in various ruins. I got the impression that there was not as much exchange of information between drivers as in Africa.

It is mass tourism where the rangers / drivers push before six to get the entrance tickets for their guests. Then 45 minutes in motorcade on a sandy path through the forest to the location where almost every safari jeep stops for a breakfast break. Along the way we did stop a few times to spot a few bird species, a crocodile and a large number of deer. After breakfast we continued our way and apart from a lonely elephant in a lake we did not see any new animals. This while the park is known for its population of leopards and lip bears. Due to the monotony of the surroundings (forest, sandy path, lake) and the lack of visibility of animals, boredom struck at some point and we returned home around noon. Entrance fee is USD 29.50 incl. VAT for an adult and USD 17.70 incl. VAT for a child up to 12 years old. In addition, depending on the size of the party and the length of the Safari (morning, afternoon, full day), you pay an amount for the car + driver.

We has an amazing guide, Chumi, who was incredible at spotting the birds and animals.  We kept a list (and took over 200 photos), with his help, and although we didn't record absolutely everything, we did note over 35 different bird species (a special interest of ours) and around 15 different mammals and reptiles, including elephants, crocodiles, leopards and Sri Lanka bear.  The leopard was very relaxed and we got lots of great photos, and were lucky enough to see it hunting, catching a mouse deer right by the side of the track.  Amazing.  Most visiting tourists push for seeing the “big 5” - elephants, water buffalo, crocodiles, leopards and bear (and we did see all of these) but Wilpattu is a fantastic park with lots more to offer and it's much better not to press your guide into rushing around.  Take some time to really look and give your guide a chance to point out wildlife, it is a wonderful National Park and an unforgettable experience. Highly recommended.","June 19, 2025",0.0,0.0

The main route for visitors within Wilpattu is a disgrace, which we are told cannot just  be blamed just on weather. This is one of the locations promoted for tourists, and the constantly bumpy journey eroded the pleasure of driving through forest and more open landscapes. Yes it is good to see animals and birds, but by sharp contrast with the tracks in public national parts of southern Africa, this is a shocker. The driver/guides in their jeeps do their very best for visitors, but in response to observations about the road they must face, they say that the relevant authority needs to be pursued. The park makes significant money from tourism and tourists deserve to have some of it returned to them in the form of an acceptable journey.","April 21, 2025",0.0,0.0

We were satisfied with everything we saw including 1 leopard. What was striking at the entrance to the park is that of the approximately 40 4x4 jeeps that were parked, approximately 90% only had 2 passengers, the average number of passengers per Jeep is now approximately 2.2. That is strange because we and some other visitors had indicated in advance that we wanted to share a jeep to save costs. The park management chooses to send as many jeeps into the park as possible because they earn more this way. This does not benefit the welfare of the animals, cars disrupt the peace of the animals. If a rare animal is spotted, 10-15 jeeps will be around it within a few minutes. The park management should aim for an average of 4 passengera per jeep, which will halve the traffic in the park. What else stands out is: At the lunch spot it is mainly the drivers who throw waste on the ground. You also see many drivers feeding animals so that their clients can take close ups of the animals. There is no enforcement of applicable rules, such as the ban on feeding and leaving waste. Our driver spoke very poor English. He knew the names of all the animals but there was no point in asking him a question, he never understood it, his English was too bad. Most drivers work long hours (5:30 AM - 6:30 PM) and our driver used a lot of betel nuts to stay awake. In the afternoon, other Jeeps regularly stopped next to us and our driver handed out beetle nuts with the other drivers. Use of betel nuts by drivers is dangerous because it masks symptoms of fatigue and is addictive. The park management would be better off using 4 passengers per jeep and 2 drivers per jeep so that they can take turns resting. Many drivers don't go far into the park and stay a short distance from the lunch spot. It would be better to drive deeper into the park, most of the animals (especially elephants) are in the north-west side of the park, at least an hour's drive from the lunch spot. To guarantee the continued existence of the park, the park management should allow a maximum number of vehicles per day and encourage the distribution of vehicles in the park. Monitor behaviour and enforcement of park regulations and ban on stimulants by staff.","January 31, 2025",0.0,0.0

At that moment about 40 4x4s pushed in and infront of each other to get the best view while blocking the view of others. The bears didn't seem to mind but took off after a few minutes. Than the race began! Vehicles speeding around the clearing to catch another view on the other side, overtaking and litterally bumping into each other. We had a terrible car (most seemed better and more comfortable) and the roads were EXTREMLY bumpy. I did safaris before and own a 4x4 myself but this was aweful. The bad condition of the roads might have been due to the continuous heavy rains over the last weeks (although end of January).

A large park, we were often on our own with no other jeeps around, although at the Leopard sightings it was an absolute traffic jam (apart from the big male when we were on our own).

When visiting, make sure to bring enough water and snacks, as you will travel a considerable distance from the entrance. The climate is hot and dusty, so be prepared for that.

As a tour guide, I’m continually impressed by the park’s untouched beauty and its reputation as one of the best locations for leopard sightings in the country. The park’s diverse ecosystems, from dense forests to open plains and serene water bodies, create a dynamic environment that supports a rich array of wildlife. One of the most exciting aspects of guiding in Wilpattu is the thrill of tracking and spotting the elusive leopard, a highlight for many visitors. The park’s relatively low visitor numbers mean that encounters with these magnificent big cats are often more intimate and rewarding. The park’s sheer size and varied landscapes offer an ever-changing safari experience. From navigating through the jungle to exploring the open plains, each game drive provides unique opportunities for wildlife observation. The sight of elephants roaming freely, the occasional glimpse of a sloth bear, and the vibrant birdlife add to the park’s allure. One of the things I love most about Wilpattu is its sense of solitude and immersion in nature. The park’s tranquil setting allows visitors to connect deeply with the natural world, away from the more crowded tourist spots. Sharing this serene and untamed beauty with travelers is incredibly fulfilling. For anyone looking to experience Sri Lanka’s wild side, Wilpattu National Park is an absolute must-visit. Its rich wildlife, stunning landscapes, and the thrill of leopard spotting make it a standout destination.

The jeeps are well maintained, seats are really comfortable ( I have done many safari's in different parts of India.)

Our principle focus was birds and the guide was very knowledgeable, we saw 82 species of birds, various mammals including 3 species of deer, water buffalo, elephant & primates etc. We also saw mugger crocodiles, flap shell turtle. No sign of leopards however we were not really looking for them. The driver was great at spotting, stopping and turning off the motor. With just 4 of us on the jeep photography was easy.

The park's responsible tourism initiatives ensure that visitors not only enjoy a breathtaking safari experience but also contribute to the preservation of this natural wonder.

From majestic elephants and elusive leopards to an array of exotic bird species, every moment felt like a scene from a wildlife documentary. In conclusion, Wilpattu National Park is more than just a tourist attraction; it's a testament to the importance of nature conservation. For anyone seeking a harmonious blend of natural beauty, diverse wildlife, and responsible tourism, Wilpattu is an absolute must-visit.

Saw herds of elephants (were quite far), crocodiles, birds of prey, small colored birds that flew with us, 3 elephants with 3 little ones and later on our path a huge herd. We couldn't believe our luck. Furthermore, it was probably mating time for the Peacock. The females were working really hard. Lots of men around it. It was choking. Many herds of deer and a fox that was lurking for a small deer. There are no herds of cars chasing each other in this park. We felt like we were the only ones. I highly recommend it.

It doesn't reveal all its glories at once, you have to be patient, but if you want to visit somewhere that still has a real feel of unspoilt wilderness then this is the place. We rarely saw other jeeps, and when we did it was easy to head off down another path. Plenty of wildlife to discover, we were lucky to see Leopards. But Leopards are shy so if you don't see one its fine. And we saw bear, deer, elephant, crocodiles, eagles, owl, water ox, and so much more. Even though a full day 6am to 6pm  is a long one. Half a day is about 4-5 hour tour. I suggest half a day tour. You need to find a good safari driver who is keen on showing wild animals to you.

We were reassured that this would be a trustworthy company to book with though sadly was not the case. After seeing 1 leopard, 1 elephant and some deer during the morning hours, we were hopeful that the afternoon would bring more encounters with the various wildlife that roam this park. We decided to pay for a pre-prepared lunch at around 20 euros for both of us. It was unfortunately not great, the food had been left on the passenger seat next to the driver for the entire very hot morning (around 30 degrees). The advantage I suppose is that the food stayed relatively hot with our drinks (water and juice) left being warm as well as our yoghurts and various other food items. We left for our afternoon session at around 1pm. We felt lucky to have had a 2nd encounter with a leopard. This time he was very far away but were able to use the driver’s binoculars to get a closer look. (As a photographer I would recommend bringing a very large zoom lens if you hope of getting pictures during the tour, we were always extremely far away from the wildlife in the park). It was after this that the tour turned sour. The driver drove around for a further 2 hours without any further encounters during this time. (I have to note that we understood that there is long periods were we won’t see anything, but it just felt that the driver lacked skill in being able to locate the various wildlife). After this 2 hour period the driver appeared to give up all search of wildlife and promptly took the road back to the exit. We left the park at 4:30pm, when we should have still had another 1 hour 30 mins left of our tour. (The park closes at 6pm). It was so disappointing as it’s around this time during the sunset hours that the wildlife starts to come back out. There was never any discussion about leaving the park, the driver never asked if it was ok. He just drove us to our car and left us there will no explanation. After contacting the owner for an explanation, he said that we had seen enough animals during our tour and that the driver had decided it was over. No apology or accountability for what had happened. Please do yourself the favour of doing a different safari here in Sri Lanka, would not recommend this company.","May 28, 2023",0.0,0.0

The camp is only a few minutes drive from the National Park’s entrance gate and our journeys to and from the park were partly taken on the wrong side of the road.   The local rice farmers have worked out that by spreading their newly harvested rice over one carriageway, the rice dries twice as quickly (using the heat attracted by the black tarmac) as traditional methods.  We took three drives (one full day and two half days) which saw us cover a good deal of the park’s forested, sandy and lake side areas.  It was great to see many animals in their natural habit and spotted deer, water buffalo, jackals and wild boar made regular appearances.  An elephant entertained us by standing in the lake, ripping vast quantities of water plants up, shaking off the mud and munching them for it’s tea.  There were many species of birds to admire, with sea eagles catching their supper from the lake, serpent eagles and owls staring regally from their tree perches and our favourite, the brightly coloured varieties of bee eaters.  Often our drives seemed like we were driving through snow, as white butterflies settled in mud pools to collect minerals and then burst into blizzard like flight as we passed close by.  A picture postcard position beside the lake was perfect for a sumptuous lunch.  A little drama was added by monkeys watching us closely for the chance of any left overs and us keeping a careful eye on the partly submerged crocodile twenty meters out in the lake.  Further searching revealed many other sightings, even a brief glimpse of a Sloth Bear.  Sadly the key attraction (leopards) remained elusive for everyone","May 10, 2020",0.0,0.0

The dirt roads, of an orange reddish colour, were not bad but there were numerous potholes and portions that were not level but this is a national park. The park hours are 0600 to 1800. The only animals in any abundance were the spotted deer. There were numerous peacocks. Other birds included parrots and egrets. A couple of iguana were seen and one turtle sunning itself. Water buffalo were seen in the water and grazing. The star of the afternoon was a somewhat hidden leopard. It did eventually walk off into the bush, clearly annoyed at the presence of so many jeeps and the level of noise. I was concerned with the speed the jeeps went en route to the leopard.

We got a brief leopard siting and two separate Sloth bear encounters, you can also see Ruddy nose mongoose and Langur monkeys. There's tons of land monitor lizards, plus brown forest lizards, skinks, geckos etc. Migratory birds as well as residents are present in abundance due to the number of lakes in the park. Lots of birds of prey too. All in all too many species to list here. Furthermore Wilpattu is less busy than other parks in Sri Lanka (some are over crowded with tourists). On our safari it seemed like we were only sharing the park with around 8-10 other jeeps. Not sure I this is always the case but felt much quieter than parks such as Mineriya and Yala. Loved it.

It's also Sri Lanka's largest national park. These two factors mean that you'll experience less safari traffic than in Yala or even Kaudulla. Another benefit, if you're lucky enough to discover a leopard or other large animal, is that there is no mobile phone reception so safari guides cannot readily communicate sightings to stimulate a mad dash by everyone within range to share the experience. It's a selfish view, but it paid off for us when we encountered a leopard on a lakeside trail in a more remote part of the park. Our driver slowly reversed the vehicle as our leopard followed us back down the trail for about 15 minutes before padding off into the jungle. We also encountered a Fishing Eagle and Crested Serpent Eagle within telephoto lens range in this park - something we had not been able to do elsewhere. Wilpattu also offers encounters with the usual suspects - water buffalo, land monitors, wild boar, spotted and barking deer, crocodiles and a wide variety of birds.","July 23, 2019",0.0,0.0

The park is so vast that a half day tour won’t do you justice. A full day safari would be more ideal if you happen to enjoy wildlife. There are few wildlife bungalows also available inside the park which you need to book from the wildlife department. An overnight stay inside the forest would be an excellent experience. We had our safari with Dilshan and he is very knowledgeable about the forest and the wildlife. He did his best to show us more animals and his friendliness made the safari more enjoyable.

I was told there were crocodiles,jaguar and many species of birds alas one eagle no crocodiles one peacock . My final impression of this park the cost of a 2 hour drive on very bumpy roads(to be expected) $100 be careful about this as the Jeep companies will take 100 aus or US whichever comes out of your wallet. We tourists create our own problems of course and the big one for this park is the amount of traffic jams in a national park like this as it is not controlled. You will not be alone looking at wildlife as most of the time there will be 20 jeeps behind you full of loud screeching tourists taking photos of scared elephants.

I did one full-day safari and started at the Eluwankulama entrance - it was quiet when I went, there were no queues and the only other jeep there was carrying the other guests from my hotel. The biggest group of jeeps that I saw at once (aside from at the rest stop) was when a leopard had been sighted in the bushes. At that point there were maybe 6-8 jeeps in the vicinity waiting for the leopard to make an appearance. The leopard did indeed come out and crossed the road in a flash! At other times throughout the day, we passed the occasional other jeep but often went long stretches of time without seeing anyone else which was really nice. The park is vast, a lot of it is wooded and so it felt harder to spot animals for this reason. There are several watering holes and you can see animals drinking around the perimeter. I did see a huge variety of birds, elephants (including a large group just before the entrance/exit to the park - I was the only jeep there), 2 leopards (fleeting / at a distance), monitor lizards, deer, monkeys... The wildlife is fewer and far between compared to other places perhaps, and we did go a couple of hours without seeing any animals at all. When you do spot something though, it feels extra special for this reason. I didn't love the rest stop where I was brought for breakfast / lunch - too many monkeys which steal food and climb into the jeeps. They are afraid of the drivers but certainly not afraid of the tourists. There are basic squat toilet facilities. I would have preferred to have parked near one of the water holes in the park and eaten there instead. Overall, if you go with the right attitude and don't expect a zoo - you will enjoy Wilpattu.","March 1, 2019",0.0,0.0

We'd already seen a mongoose cross the road before we got to the park and at the entrance on a bird feeder there was a beautifully tailed Ceylon Paradise Flycatcher, so it was a good start. It turned out to be a very good trip for birdlife. I'm no expert but we saw kingfishers, Junglefowl, painted storks, peafowl, woolly necked storks, a great thick knee, bee eaters by the dozen, and plenty more, including an in-flight white bellied sea eagle and a crested serpent eagle that happily posed in a tree by the track. As for mammals and reptiles.... whilst we didn't spot any elephants, we saw monitor lizards, crocodiles, monkeys, mongoose, chipmunks, deer and water buffalo, but the highlight for us was that we were lucky enough to see (and see very well) a leopard just prowling in the undergrowth about 15 or 20 feet off the track. Sadly it was obscured by foliage so I couldn't get a clear photograph of the leopard, but will always remember just how big and powerful he looked. So all in all had a very good first safari. We had been a little concerned at the beginning that we'd just be following jeep after jeep but although it was busier than I would have liked we still saw a good deal and felt it was an interesting trip. The breakfast stop at the lake appears to be an automatic place to pause for a break, but be warned, don't leave anything loose especially food as the very knowing monkeys here will snatch it away before you have a chance to blink and they just love hotel pack ups.","February 28, 2019",0.0,0.0

One was an afternoon safari and one was an all day safari. Wilpattu is a big park and there are less roads than at Yala, but there are also a lot less jeeps, and for much of our wildlife viewing we were on our own. During our afternoon safari we watched a sloth bear feeding from a termite nest very close to the road. We were able to sit there for around 20 minutes and during that time we were joined by maybe half a dozen other jeeps - a complete contrast to Yala where around 30 jeeps were competing for a view of a sloth bear which was much further away from the road. We saw lots of animals and birds. We didn't see a leopard but we saw plenty of evidence that they were around - lots of very recent footprints in the sand - it's down to luck whether you actually see one or not, but the chance is obviously increased by the number of safaris you undertake. There is a place where they stop for lunch and breakfast where there is also a basic hole in the ground type toilet. Beware of all the monkeys there, who will steal your food at any opportunity! As expected it is a very bumpy ride in the jeep and my husband suffered a bit as he has some joint problems - especially during the all day safari, which lasted from 6.15am to 6.00pm. However the advantage of the all day safari is that they can take you much further into the park, away from any other jeeps. This park is not for kids who will easily get bored - but it is a genuinely immersive wildlife experience.","February 27, 2019",0.0,0.0

We stayed at The Backwaters and organized our safari trip with them and found them to be very trustworthy. They charged us LKR 6500 (Feb 2019), for a private Jeep fitting up to 6 people with an extra guide to sit with us. The Jeep and entrance fee must be paid in the local currency. Seeing a leopard or a bear is up to luck, and we unfortunately didn’t see these animals. We came close to spotting a leopard in the bushes but mostly the guide spotted it and could take a picture of it for us. The bushes are really dense so you have to be really lucky or early to spot a leopard walking up to you on the roads or in an open space. We did a half day safari starting from 6:30 to about 11am. By the end of it we were pretty beat. So maybe it's more advisable to do a morning and evening safari on two separate days if you wish. Bring a jacket and wear light long pants as the Jeep is open (windy) and the morning air gets quite cold. The drive in is through a long road of dense bush land which might be a bit boring if you can't spot anything. There are small ponds where you might spot crocodiles. Our favorite spots were the open spaces with a sort of marshland or watering hole / lakes which look like a dreamland. There you can spot heards of deers, and if you're lucky like us, a large elephant swimming through the water! Simply magical! We also spotted wild boars, many birds, a turtle, a ferret and monkeys. Of course we wished we'd seen more large animals but it is up to luck really. We would rate the park more highly if it would have had more plentiful, and better maintained washrooms which are a basic necessity for an area which invites tourists to visit it. There is no soap, the toilet is a squatting toilet which you can't even flush, so you can imagine the smell. Please bring your own toilet paper and hand soap... And of course someone has to invariably take a dump just on the side of the toilet hole itself. Why??? If you can, use the washroom near the ticketing office and avoid drinking till you're about to leave the park again.","February 8, 2019",0.0,0.0

We decided to eschew Yala as it has a reputation of being very busy, so can't comment on that, but Wilpattu isn't as quiet as we expected - even if there are only a dozen or so vehicles, you'll still end up seeing the same cars time and again as you search endlessly for wildlife!  The bush is pretty thick in places in Wilpattu, so spotting stuff can be pretty tricky at times, particularly if your driver is driving at a quicker pace that you'd like!  We started early - we were in the park by 6.15am - and it was cold, particularly with the windchill when driving - if you go early, do yourself a favour and take some warm layers with you!  We did spot quite a few things on our day safari - lots of birdlife, and quite a few mammals and reptiles too.  We weren't lucky enough to see a leopard on this occasion, but we did see a sloth bear late in the day and there's clearly a grapevine as within 10 minutes of spotting it there were about 10 vehicles around us!  We noticed quite a few vehicles had separate guides while we just had a driver - haveing done other safaris this concerned us, as normally a separate guide is a good thing (we re-organised our safari late due to issues with our previously arranged trip so had little choice!) and while we managed OK in the end I'd suggest a separate guide would be better.  It can be a very long day though - we were in at 6.15am and left the park at about 5.30pm, having been batttered and bruised from the drive in the meantime.  Still, it was well worth it - while we seemed to spend more time driving round to find stuff than we'd have liked, we did see a decent quantity and variety of animals in the end, and came away feeling pretty happy about it (probably the sloth bear siting helped!)","January 22, 2019",0.0,0.0

If you got a full day ride or morning ride, it's better to enter to park by 6am. Chance of meeting elephants are bit higher in evening. And during the March & April, chance of meeting bears is quit high. Most importantly, if you want to see wildlife make sure you ask your safari driver to drive bit patiently through the park.

Whilst the first time I stayed overnight in Puttlum before coming back to Colombo, this time I wanted to try making it within a day. Thus, a team of 5 including me traveled early in the morning, and did reach the main entrance by 09:00 am, since we made a wrong turn, which delayed reaching our destination. Since we traveled after rains during mid December in 2018, the weather was cool and comfortable. My biggest aim was to spot a leopard and a sloth bear this time as I did not get the chance of spotting one the previous time I traveled. There were only few jeeps inside the park from the time we entered until around 03:00 pm in the afternoon, and as such we had the opportunity enjoy the nature and its beauty in more relaxed moods. We did spot a variety of birds, and then many deer roaming about. We did see the most often seen lonely elephant who enjoys reeds that grow, and did manage to see a single leopard cub, who spend about 20 mts traveling in front of our jeep, without being disturbed. I hoped that I would see a bear and many crocodiles, but I was not lucky enough to see them. We left the park entrance around 06:30 pm on the same day and headed to Colombo and reached Colombo around 10:30 pm. Though we expected to be tired, non of felt tired after a full day of traveling and spending inside wilderness. Hope to travel again to see many more animals to Wilpattu National Park as soon as possible. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304132-d2706501-r645311122-Wilpattu_National_Park-Anuradhapura_North_Central_Province.html#","January 12, 2019",0.0,0.0

This is a tough one. Staying at a Wildlife Conservation Department bungalow inside a national park is at best compared to camping out, except you have a roof over your head. Let’s list out what you don’t have: Charging facilities for camera batteries. Wi-fi Refrigeration Mobile phone signal Easy access to groceries If you’ve never stayed in a WCD bungalow before, you’d be in for a shock. You have to take everything you need for the duration of your stay into the park. Everything. From water to toilet amenities to linen and towels. You have to plan your meals and buy what you need to make them. And not just for you and your party but for at least 3 other adults - the tracker, driver and caretaker cum cook. The Wildlife Conservation Department say you don’t have to feed their employees, but practically this is impossible. How can you not feed the people looking after your well-being in the middle of a jungle? So don’t go stay at a WCD Bungalow if you don’t have someone who can coordinate everything for you, between your party and the WCD bungalow stay. That would be a disaster waiting to happen. As is was, with all our planning, on or third day there we were down to our last two and a half litres of water, which was cutting it a bit fine, in my book. The thing is, if any of what you’ve read up to now has thrown you off staying inside a national park - a jungle - you’re not the type of person who should be there in the first place. The Bungalows inside the national parks run by the WCD are for people who enjoy the thrill of a perfect capture of a leopard walking right up to them. Or observing an elephant chase off errant safari vehicles from the comfort of the bungalow verandah. Or being the early birds in a wildlife park, with the best chance of  spotting a wide variety of birds and beasts. Or being the last people to finish a safari for the day, driving up to you bungalow exactly at 6:00pm at which time all human activity in the park has to be confined to the WCD bungalows that are occupied. It’s an experience that, if you could make happen, you should have at least once in your life. Most people forfeit this experience for hiring a safari Jeep outside the park and driving into the park for a three hour excursion. This is understandable because when you’re on holiday the last thing on your mind would be meal planning and buying groceries - say nothing of the time constraints forced upon you by packaged tours. This method of seeing the park works too.  But you’d never know that exhilarating feeling of seeing a Sloth Bear less than ten meters away from your back door at 8:45pm, having his dinner  (fruits from a tree in the garden. You can not, ever, feed the animals). And then there are the birds and beasts. Each sighting of an animal or a bird is unique and it doesn’t matter if you’re in the park for a drive in and out safari or staying in the park at a bungalow. There’s always that sense of awe when you’re tracker leads your vehicle along the path that he thinks the leopard would take - and he turns out to be right! A word about the WCD personnel here. You can’t enter any national park without a tracker. This is the person who works for the department who has a twofold job. The first and arguable the most important is to see that you and your party behave themselves in the park, not “spooking” the wildlife. The second is to show you as much of the wildlife in the park as possible. For this the tracker has to know not only the geography of the park, but the psychology of the animals in the park. A good tracker is essential to a good experience as much as good planing is. We had a good tracker. We spotted eight individual leopards in two and a half days. We also saw Elephant, Water Buffalo and Bear, Barking and Spotted Deer, Jackal, Wild Boar and over 25 different species of birds of which two were endemic and one sighting was absolutely unique - a juvenile Serpent Eagle practising a kill on twigs on the ground. The only animal the tracker didn’t show us was the bear. The bear visited us himself! The safari jeep and driver we hired because without that combo, one of the party would have had to drive. This of course would have meant one of us would be concentrating on the road and not on seeing things. Not having to do that was a good call on our part. Do I recommend a stay at the Panikkar Villu Bungalow? The answer is an unqualified yes. No matter what your have to do to prep for your stay there, it’s worth it.","August 30, 2018",0.0,0.0

As a result, much wildlife has been left to its own devices, but like many others, licences jeeps and drivers are available for hire. Our cost 8,000rps each and was designed to be one of the longest trips. You can negotiate shorter trips for less cost down to about 4,000rps each. Our Jeep driver was very happy to stop and check things out and during a 4 hour trip, we managed to see most of Sri Lanka's wildlife starting with a smaller adult bull elephant grazing on the trees about 500 metres from the park entrance. During the trip we also saw crocodiles, Mongoose, sand deer, spotted deer, water buffalo, monkey and many birds which thankfully our quite could identify for us. We had begun the trip at 2pm and we're lucky enough to get a call that a leopard had been spotted - quite close to the entrance again - so we rushed for half an hour to get to this spot and were very lucky indeed to catch sight of this beautiful creature. Apparently there are 12 leopards living in this area and with 2 babies this year the population is at least steady, although pressure on space can lead to conflict with the local population. The ride was bumpy and dusty, but the experience was wonderful and it was an inspired idea to create this further wildlife reserve. We have so enjoyed our opportunities to see the wildlife and watching as these creatures shyly come to the water holes and lakes in the late afternoon has been a real privilege. Don't miss an opportunity at some stage to get out into the countryside and the skill of the Jeep drivers both managing to traverse the tracks, know their way round the parks, work out where best to see the animals and communicate with each other, was very impressive.","August 26, 2018",0.0,0.0

Go early morning or late evening given more likely to see leopards and elephants etc. It’s about a 3 hr drive from Colombo and then u are driving a few hours again in a Jeep in the back so again do one of the local temples and do this next day given u are sitting down way too long otherwise.

I wasn't too bothered about elephants as have spent substantial time with them elsewhere in Asia. I was so happy I stuck to my guns and visited Wilpattu on my first day in the country. The park was peaceful and unlike other parks, wasn't overrun with jeep safari's. In fact, I only saw 4 other vehicles in the whole 3 hours and that was because we called them to say what we saw. And what did we see? Leopards - 2, black sloth bears, deer, birds, water buffalo, iguanas, mongoose - everything. Luck was shining on me on my visit. My trip (as a solo) was expensive but well worth the cash. I  almost don't want to recommend Wilpattu as it's a hidden gem often overlooked. Just remember it's not a zoo though and you may be disappointed if you don't see anything if you go. It's a huge national park and chances to see wild animals are slim.

We did one afternoon and two mornings and hit the jackpot on the first one (pm).  The leopard only appeared for a few minutes but as we went prepared not to see one, I was so in awe when we did that I was literally shaking trying to take photos.  The second sighting was on the second morning.  A baby leopard suddenly appeared crossing the track quickly followed by mummy.  Wow! We saw so much more in the 2/3 hours we were there.  The bird life is amazing.  There was a crocodile hidden in the undergrowth which was a surprise as it was quite a way from water.  Only one elephant, but I don’t know how many are in the park.  3/4 different kinds of deer.  Monitor lizards were in abundance (all sizes).  The only animal missing from the list was a sloth bear, but we thought we were so lucky seeing what we did. The jeeps tend to space themselves out so we felt we were the only ones there most of the time.  There is just one place where we were allowed out of the vehicle, which is a seating area near a lake.  Crocs can be seen in the distance! The toilets were being worked on when we were there (April) so I had to brave it and disappear into the undergrowth.

It is about 6 hours travel from Colombo.  It seems to be the largest and the oldest national park in Sri Lanka. However, it is less visited than Yala National Park in down south. This park is mostly known for Leopards. They say about 40 leopards are in the park. We were able to see a cub leopard and two more adults. We were not fortunate enough to see a single elephant. But lot of birds like peacock, Bee- eaters, Eagle, butterflies and many more birds. Also lot of deer, barking deer, Sambar were sighted. Several crocodiles were at the lake. One bear was walking along the road looking for food I suppose. Several land monitors were seen. This Wilpattu National Park is an amazing wealth we got and we must protect it.

I didn’t have anyone to go with so had to solo it. And honestly had a very mixed experience. I quite enjoy solo travelling but a safari can be PRETTY boring alone at times- especially if there are only 3-4 other jeeps around. I booked through my hotel- “Rajratra reach resort” and the owner didn’t explain the price properly to me- so had some issues there (he was genuinely a nice guy and I am just giving him benefit of the doubt that he forgot to explain me that there’s an entrance fee along with the Jeep hire. Anyway the safari part: it’s the biggest national park in Sri Lanka and there are numerous lakes inside (approx 42) which is responsible for the unique eco culture. We were the only ones to spot a leopard on the day- so I was pretty happy. We also saw: plenty of peacocks, Sri Lankan jungle fowl, eagles, wild buffalos, various other bird species, fox, crocodiles, deer (plenty). In summary: don’t recommend a full day safari; would recommend going in a large group (more fun and easier on the wallet); bring binoculars; also try booking through your hotel and get a good price but make all the costs very clear at the start. Also bring plenty of food and water there’s not much once you re inside the park. Getting to Wilpattu: - note the Wilpattu is closest to Anuradhapura (about 30kM) - how I got to Wilpattu? - I was staying in a hotel in Anuradhapura - I caught the 5am bus (from the “Main bus station”) and asked the conductor to drop me off at Wilpattu junction (Rs70) - note that there are 2 buses- bus #4 and another one I can’t remember (they are both heading towards Colombo) - my safari driver was waiting there and took me to the entrance gate where we bought the entrance tickets.","May 12, 2018",0.0,0.0

Because if I were to say: we saw amazing plants, eagles, beeeaters..., people just switch off. In Africa, they only want to hear if you have seen the big 5, here in Wilpattu, wildlife has been reduced to the Big 3. That makes me a bit sad because surely all of nature is to be appreciated? The bad reviews here baffle me: how can you review a forest? I seem to understand that if people see a leopard, they give it a high rating, otherwise not so... well Wilpattu is not a zoo but a vast and sometimes densely overgrown Wilderness. I loved the wildness of it, the lakes full of Lillies, the trees... we only saw a glimpse of a leopard and a lone elephant far away but we saw an eagle a meter away from use, colourful green bee-eaters right close, monkeys, deer, fighting lizards, storks, peacocks, a giant squirrel and many birds. Isn't that amazing? In my book, it is. We got the impression lots of people come here for the day from the beaches and they expect to have the animals shown to them on demand.

We continued with the safari as our guide didn't understand our complaints with the short notice. We saw no animals at all. We paid the full amount for no animals, half the amount of time and our own pick up and drop off. We would never have paid what we did for 3 hours safari if we had known in advance.","August 14, 2017",0.0,0.0

We asked our safari jeep driver to get there as early as possible and somehow managed to get the tickets. Just 10 mins into the park we came across a huge sloth bear by the road which was busy searching for food (insects) totally ignoring our presence. Amazing ! However, we can clearly see the animals and birds struggling big time due to the drought and most of the waterholes were empty. Kudos to our wildlife department, in the evening huge number of trucks are been sent into the park to fill the waterholes and artificial tanks. Since we were the first to enter the park and one point we saw some leopard footprints on our pathway and our driver started tracking it. However, after following it for about 20 mins it suddenly disappeared. But 15 minutes later our driver got a call from his colleague that they found a leopard, then our driver rushed to the place where there were already four jeeps waiting desperate to get a glimpse of the elusive leopard. A mom and two cubs ! Mom and the elder cub have already crossed the road, the younger one got stuck at the other side as we were blocking the road. The thick dense forest didn't allow us to observe the animal properly. I was able to see only the back and the tail !  Afterwards All four drivers quickly decided to leave and give room for the cub to join her mom. Later on we even came across a dead elephant by the side of the road. Although Wilpattu is the largest national park in Sri lanka it has got the least number of elephants compared to other national parks. Strange isn't it ! This could be the reason for the abundance of bear and leopard population in Wilpattu.","August 10, 2017",0.0,0.0

The Sri Lankan subspecies of the leopard, Panthera Pardus Kotiya, can sometimes be seen here. This park remains a challenge for viewers because animals have plenty of areas where they can avoid being seen - which is exactly the way things should be. I waited 34 years (1981 to 2015) to see my first adult leopard here, but it was well worth the wait. The ""Villu"" system in this park is also unique. Villus are large ponds - or small lakes, if you prefer - that are surrounded by sand. Most hold fresh water - making them attractive to both predator and prey during times of drought.

Here I'll give you a breakdown of what it cost us in Feb 2017. And ill let you know what I thought of it. Here is a breakdown of the costs: Jeep entrance: 250 Jeep hire: 4000rs Park entrance per foreigner: 2175rs Park entrance per local (your driver): 60rs Service charge: 1160 Government tax: 882 Guide: we got this free but often the drivers don't speak English so you'll need a guide as well. Tips: your choice but it's expected that you will. So in total, for 2 people it cost us: 10,762 or about 5000rs each. Basically, whatever a jeep company quotes you, it won't be the full price because there are so many components to the price. As a rough guide, it's always 5000pp for every national park. Obviously the jeep hire is divided by the amount of guests, they are normally 6 seaters. Be prepared, they will be very reluctant to find someone for you to share with because they get less money. Do this without them knowing and pretend you are travelling as a group. The actual park of Wilpattu is nice although the elephant herds are rather small. Also, it's unfair on the animals to chase them around too close so don't expect the up-close encounters. We saw a sloth bear but no leopard. I like Wilpattu more than udawalawe.

But the pick of them is leopard, followed by Sri Lankan sloth Bear, both of which are elusive and hard to spot, with a 30%-40% chance imo. You could see Elephants, Crocodiles and Buffaloes too on most days. Park is nearly 1500 hectares, having over 40 water holes called ""willus"". The attraction is to spot the animals, and if you have enough time to see the dynamics between the hunter and the hunted. Here are few factors that may be handy to know a. Park is open from 6am to 6pm b. Entrance for locals is around LKR 800 for foreigners its more c. Jeep fee are negotiable half day LKR 4500 and full day LKR 8000 for locals. For foreign nationals it my be 5000 and 10,000 respectively. Get a Toyota or Mistubishi jeep rather than Mahendra ones.  You may want to look at the seat too d. There are no supermarkets, well stocked shops or restaurants close to the park. So arrange for food (breakfast and lunch) , water and any other refreshment you need prior to going in to the park. This is sad part, but true. Even after coming out of the park at 6pm you cant get a good cup of Ceylon tea, unless you have pre-arranged or travel to Nochiyagama (few km from Wilpattu Junction). Suggets you buy the following 1. Water Bottles from Cargills/ Keels Super or Arpico / American Premium or Aquafin 2. Tea : There are iced tea/ fruit juices if you like to sip in 3. Some fruits or nuts: Almonds and Guava are my favorites if I'm going for a full day. Anamaalu bananas are good too. e. Park has different routes so you could say you want to go up to Thambapanni (Kudiraimalai Point) which is a beach where early settlers to Sri Lanka from India came. But less animals or birds here. But you could see sea eagles fishing on most days and large elephants on Periya willu or Periya uppu villu and sinna uppu willu. You can ask the jeep to go towards Pomparippu where seeing elephants is more likely though its a dusty road. f. There is a very basic washroom at Kumbukwillu where jeeps stop for breakfast (around 8-9) and lunch around 1pm. Better to tell him your expected lunch time so that you don't have to keep worrying g. between 12.30 to 2pm these jeep drivers prefer not to drive and the excuse they say is that animals will be resting during this time. Only partly true imo but unless you know the driver well, you may have to stick to taking photos around Kumbuwillu. One driver to us to a church close to pomparippu but that is not a done deal it seems h. you could stay at Anuradhapura and drive to the park early morning or stay in wilpattu itself. Rooms start at around 3000 for locals. You may have to check if the hotel/ motel provides food (breakfast and lunch) early morning at 5.30 or so before confirming the motel/ hotel. I. During dry season lots of dust / If you are going with the kids you may want to use masks. Caps and sunglasses are must. I don't go there without my camera, or at least binoculars. I have been there few times. I have been to other parks in Sri Lanka, but for diversity in terms of animals and landscape, no other park could beat Willpattu.

A few herds of deers and buffalos. Two gigantic elephants and a few other birds and mammals but that's all. We had a full day tour for 5.5k lkr pax (4ppl in the jeep).

All the talk about this park is the chance to see a leopard. The problem with that is the chance of seeing one is 50-50. So like what happened to me... there is potential to be disappointed when you fail to see one. Probably the biggest problem with this park is that it is quite thick jungle and as such the view from the Safari truck can get a bit monotonous. That being said the scenery opens up at some points and when it does it is majestic. I saw in Enormous Lotus Lily Ponds, beautiful lakes and a whole bunch of animals I was not expecting such as a very cool 'Sloth Bear', Buffalo, deer, crocodiles, monkeys and a lot - and I mean a lot - of birds of amazing colours and shapes. At the end of the day I had to tell myself 'self don't be disappointed you ... might have missed out on the leopard but half the people do... but you still got to see something pretty amazing.' So I think if the park perhaps talked down the leopard a bit and talked up the other great things They have this might be a more well known attraction. A half day was enough... It opens at 6am. It is about 1 hour out of Anuradhapura so it makes for an additional half day trip if you are visiting the ancient city there. The heat would make any longer in the park unbearable - and besides, the animals are all hiding and sleeping in the middle of the day. Take a lot of water and food with you as the shop was not open when the park opened.","August 10, 2016",0.0,0.0

I chose to come here over Yala and the more famous reserves in the south as I had heard a lot of tales from other travellers about irresponsible operators in that park, harassing the animals and behaving dangerously.  So I decided I'd prefer to visit a park that had lower chances of seeing a leopard, but at least wouldn't put the animal at any risk if I did see one. Vilpaththu does have all sorts of animals living within its forests, including leopards, sloth bears, crocodiles, and a very small number of elephants.  You are not guaranteed to see them.  I have been lucky enough to already see leopards in Africa, so I was perhaps more relaxed about this than some travellers may be. The park consists of dense jungly forest, interspersed with big lakes (the name means 'many lakes').  You drive in high, open sided jeeps along well defined but bumpy red earth tracks, through the forest.  There are relatively few tracks so you tend to take the route there is.  There aren't options for vehicles to go 'off road' due to the forest, which is a good thing as it prevents the environment being degraded. On a four hour trip, I saw lots of different wildlife, including crocodiles (huge, and really good views), spotted and barking deer, mongooses, peacocks, green bee eaters, a serpent eagle, beautiful butterflies, large monitor lizards, two types of monkey, wild boar, and wading birds.  For me, a lot of the joy of a safari is not knowing what you might see next, and its that thrill of the unknown that makes it such a great experience.  Even if you see nothing at all, I find that makes the experience worthy in itself.  Of course, I'm lucky in having done several safaris in different places, so perhaps get less anxious about seeing things that people who might have only had this chance. If I'd had more time, I'd have been happy to stay here and do a few game drives over a couple of days.  I reckon if you went several times you'd have a pretty good chance of seeing a leopard or bear.  You are unlikely to see elephants here, but there are lots of other parks in Sri Lanka where you've got a really high chance, so factor in a trip to one of those too if you can.  It's a well managed park, with no litter and not too many jeeps, and I loved it.  If you have never seen big wildlife before and are desperate to see a leopard, you might be better off going for one of the southern parks.  But I'd highly recommend this park in addition if you can, or for those who are happy to see smaller animals.","February 23, 2016",0.0,0.0

The park is half the size of Rhode Island and is full of animal we did not see in Udawalewe or Bundalla.  The park itself is beautiful but the during the last hour as it was getting cooler (after 4:00) we saw a large male leopard asleep in the road.  We were far enough away that he took his time waking up and moving on.  Everyone was ecstatic as we quietly watched this amazing animal.   I was fortunate to have a large lens on my camera and I've been asked to share the photos with our driver.

After taking the advice of a very helpful lady at our hotel (Menuka at Jetwing Blue), I booked this trip which included transfer from/to the hotel, a naturist guide (also provided by the hotel) and the jeep safari at the park. We were staying in Negombo, so it was a 3 hour journey to the park.  Kids feel asleep and I enjoyed seeing the various sights along the way. Once at the park, our guide took care of everything whilst we had lunch (which was a picnic provided by our hotel) - all very nice and relaxed! The jeep safari was excellent - basically it is a converted 4x4 pick up truck with comfy seats welded/bolted into the back.  It had a roof but open sides - so we only got a little bit wet when the rain poured down! During our visit there were intermittent heavy downpours, but this did not in any way spoil the experience.  Our kids loved it (aged 7 and 3). We saw many animals and birds, each explained by the naturist who had a book and binoculars (my 3 year old was so much more interested to be shown the book when looking at something in real life - it made it more understandable for him). Highlights included there was the lone bull elephant eating reeds in one of the lakes, a leopard (which we only spotted on the way back), large land lizards, peacocks and other colourful birds. We left as it was getting dark, and just before the gate there was an elephant crossing the path - we had to wait until it disappeared into the bush, but then it let out a loud roar which the kids thought was amazing. Although it was a long journey from/to our hotel (because of young kids), we all thoroughly enjoyed the visit and it is a memory that we will cherish.","February 21, 2016",0.0,0.0

Many people go to this northern wildlife park to see leopards, which has 38 of them, and never do. We saw 3 in one day, including one that put on a show in the road just a few meters away. Also spectacular is the birdlife; water fowl and eagles. This park straddled the former conflict zone during the civil war and was off-limits for nearly 20 years until the war ended in 2009. It is Sri Lanka's oldest and largest park. Its jungle is dense, making it a challenge to see even large animals. But to me, it is far preferable to Yala National Park in the south, which has so many visitors that its rutted roads are as jammed with traffic as central Colombo. And any leopard sighting attracts an unruly jostling of jeeps. That rarely happens in Wilpattu. The landscape changes dramatically in the northern part of the park, more open grasslands where herds of elephants roam -- though often at a distance. Keep an eye out in the treetops on this side for the magnificent hornbill.","February 16, 2016",0.0,0.0

Although the 18h30 park closing time is flexible (we left at 18h45 as part of a caravan of 7), park rules forbid artificial light (e.g. headlights!), which (because dark falls quickly at about 18h35) puts a natural limit on your visit.

The authorities really need to improve the condition of the tracks. Some of them have very deep gouges and others are completely water logged and impassable. My biggest grouse was the toilets. They are in a shocking condition and a disgrace to the whole country. I shudder to think of what visitors from overseas think of the standard of hygiene of this island. I do believe that the one near the Admin block has not been flushed or cleaned for at least a month. It must have been teeming with Bacteria and a site for air borne diseases. The odours from the one within the park reached at least a 10 meter radius around it. Yuck!!!! The Department of Wildlife Conservation obviously does not care about the awful image created or the health hazards. We fully intend returning when time permits, because although we did not encounter any thrilling experiences, we did prefer it to the other parks in Sri Lanka which are overcrowded with visitors where  one encounters jeeps racing around thoughtlessly. It was much quieter here and to us, a typical wildlife park and not a circus. Since it was a very large park, 13,00 ha, it was not easy to cover much ground with the rough tracks. The Water holes were full since this was post the rains, and were very serene to look at. There were large expanses of water, which could be a reason for the lack of sightings, as the animals probably had small pools inside the jungle to quench their thirst.

Back then the park was closed for visitors during the war. In 2003, during a ceasefire agreement, we managed to get permission to camp in the park. It was the most exhilarating experience, camping deep in the dense wilderness, next to the clear waters of the Moderagam Aru. Due to heavy poaching back then the sightings were few, but I will never forget the massive tusker I encountered on Percy Bendhi wewa close to the park entrance. I named the tusker ""Wasantha"" after the gutsy park warden back then Mr. Wasantha Pushpananda. Since then I cant count how many time I have visited the park. Maybe over 500 times. As a review what I would say is this park gives the most complete and ""real"" wildlife and wilderness experience out of all the parks in Sri Lanka. Don't come expecting a quick fix of wildlife, where a one day trip would result in a loads of wildlife. Remember this is not a zoo ! this is a real national park with real wild animals and they would choose to appear or disappear. I would highly recommend spending at least 2 full day safari's in the park to get a real feel of the place. Also having a great driver/guide is a must. This is the place, where if I die, I want my ashes scattered, its that special to me. Over the last 13 years of visiting the park, I have seen many amazing sighting, from 5 hour leopard sightings, to tuskers, bears, elusive and rare Forest Eagle Owls, our jeep being rammed by a wild boar and so much more.

The overall experience in the park was very good. We were at the park in late December which is also the tail end of the monsoon season. The park was lush and green and most of the “Villu’s” or Lakes were at full capacity. The park name “Wilpattu” is derived from these shallow “Villu’s”. Driving on the water filled sand banks of the “Villu’s were a great experience The sanctuary is located in the dry part of the country and it is the dryness of the surrounding that attracts animals to the many waterholes.  We didn’t get to see too many animals because there is plenty of water inside the jungle for them to drink. We were lucky to spot a bear as we were leaving the park. The park is very large (appox 13,00 ha) and was declared a wild life sanctuary in 1938. We arrived at the park around 2.00 pm and were forced to leave before the gates close at 6.00 pm.

It's Sri Lanka's biggest park, but in terms of wild life it's thinly spread. Our tour was however still amazing, the park is beautiful, but we didn't see what we come for... Not the park's fault of course. The number of visitors in the park is very low which is of course a big plus. We had a private jeep with a great driver and spotter. He was very knowledgeable about the park and all the (wild) life inside. The park is well laid out. I had a bit of a feeling too much was 'touched'.

Took some time for him to come out and he crossed the road. -- Just before we left the park, we saw an elephant hidden behind bushes. -- A cool green/blue bird. -- Some deers. -- Some monkeys. -- A lizard or two. -- Two white storks. -- Quite some peafowl.","November 28, 2015",0.0,0.0

I had to change my group's itinerary at the last minute due to the announcement of Yala that it will be closing on the day my group was supposed to go there for a safari. I think it was the best unfortunate circumstance to happen because we managed to spot leopards on 3 different areas of Wilpattu. The park is beautiful. We went in early September so it was the end of the drought season. Near the opening of the park, it was dry and almost arid but deeper into it you will see the lush fullness of the forest around the reservoirs. Our guide, Krishan Fernando of Triplanka Tours was a god send. If you're a bird watcher you will love the guy. He identified all the wildlife we saw, most especially the birds. He knows all the local birds of Sri Lanka by heart. He even brought binoculars with him. Had a good eye in spotting the wildlife in the bushes, better even that our hired park driver. We paid 3300rupees each for a group of 6 people for 6 hours in the afternoon in the park. Thats 130-630pm. We opted afternoon with the thought that the animals will start appearing after the heat of midday, maybe near the watering holes. We were lucky. We saw a 2 year old adult male leopard 3-4 hours into the safari. It was just right there. Lounging beside a bush at the edge of clearing near a lake. Like a boss. The other two we saw while going back to the entrance. Along the road! One was around an 18 month old female who probably just left the care of its mum as our guides said and another was a cub, barely a year old. so the mum was also probably hiding somewhere in the bush. We didn't spot a sloth bear, our guide said it wasn't the time of the year but the leopards alone were so worth it. Just hope for the best though, not everyone sees one. They do get scared if there are too many jeeps around. We were lucky there were only a max of maybe 15 jeeps that afternoon with us. A couple we talked to spent an entire day at the park without seeing a single leopard or bear. Just birds.","September 28, 2015",0.0,0.0

Wilpatthu , however remains in my eyes at least, heaven on earth for anyone seeking to reconnect with nature and who values the feeling of being in the wilderness It is much less popular than Yala, and I wish , very selfishly I may add, that it remains so, so we will be spared the excesses of human nature that Yala so unfortunately exemplifies.

Others in the camp where we stayed did a whole day safari and they saw the leopards, crocodiles etc. I think the driver / the guide makes a lot of difference. When we asked if leopards were around, the guide just said the season isn't right, but i think he couldn't have cared less... The nature, with the big lakes is beautiful though, other parts just look like a European forest! I wouldn't recommend it for small kids for sure. Whole day safari probably, as you cover so much more of the park. The entrance the park was 4700LKR for 2 adults (if I remember right).

Who knows, a day earlier or later, and our trip might have been very different..? Bearing that in mind I still decided to report here how disappointing our trip was today. After all, I'm not particularly spoiled when it comes to Safaris, never having been to Africa for example. We made a similar trip a few years ago in Perus jungle region near Puerto Maldonado, and we haven't seen anything larger than a Capybara. Still, there there was a general feeling of the forests around us teeming with wildlife, with animal noises abound and much rustling and cracking in the underbrush... In comparison, Wilpattu felt about as exotic and alife as your standard European mixed forest. Some birds, some lizard, a few deer... That was it. Not for a minute was I under the impression that it would've been risky to leave the Jeep and have a stroll around. Some guides did even that. Of course, there must've been a small chance to run into a Leopard, but the chances of that happening seemed slimmer than being bit by a venomous snake somewhere else in the country. We've seen more animals on a two hour bike trip in Anuradaphura than in these five mildly boring hours on the backseat of the Jeep in Wilpattu. And the bike tour certainly didn't cost us $120. Even worse, the road into the park was the same as the road back, so after 2 1/2 hours even the scenery started to repeat... If you consider doing this trip while in Anuradaphura: - Consider another park maybe, if your travel plans allow for it..? E.g. the Eco park near Sigirya was a slight disappointment for the couple accompanying us, but in there at least we saw a bunch of Elephants a Tortoise and many of the same birds in half the time at a fraction of the cost. Later they showed us amazing pictures of their trip to Yala (which by itself seems to be dismissed by many experienced travelers as not being a must-see). If you're anywhere near those places, and if you don't get a much better deal for Wilpattu than we did, these might give you better value for your money and time. - If there's just two of you, try to find some other travelers to share the cost of the Jeep... Nothing will soften the blow for the entrance fees which are as steep as everywhere else in Sri Lanka. - Make sure you book a GUIDE, not just a DRIVER. I knew beforehand that this would have been preferrable but I was too lazy to look further for better options. Our driver missed more animals that we spotted (scaring them away with the Jeep) than the other way around, and we felt that he already wanted to have it over with way before we left the park. All in all, a big disappointment for us.","June 10, 2015",0.0,0.0

With good guide you will be seen a World which was just hidden from naked eye. Good Camera with Zoom lences are must. We had BF in the jungle. Oh God monkeis are the problem. As you are going to stay in the jungle for around 4 hours (Hald day Safari) it is advisable to use washrooms before enter. Leoperds den is a good tourist hotel with good food. You can visit them at the main road turn to National park.,"February 25, 2015",0.0,0.0

Our hostel arranged a driver who took us to the park and then transferred us to a park jeep in which we spent the morning hunting around for leopards. Spoiler Alert: We found two jaguars and they were magnificent to see up close. Neither they nor the peacocks, deer or other animals were particularly skittish so it made for great photos. We observed both park department jeeps as well as private vehicles but all the drivers seemed to be in touch so that when a sighting was made, the other vehicles were able to coordinate to maximize sightings. We were able to get out and stretch at a designated rest zone (with a bathroom). I wished that we had more time to spend there and we appreciated that the guides were both expeditious in their attempts to cover as much ground as possible but also stayed put as long as we felt like taking pictures at a given spot. Good times.","February 25, 2015",0.0,0.0

It's is much advisable to spend at least two days to enjoy the stay if you want to take loads of pictures. And also bring a good zoom lens :) . You have to have patience in order to see lots of animals. Start as early as possible. The park opens to the public at 6.00 am.  And closes at 6.00 pm. You can reserve a safari Jeep prior visiting the park to avoid any discomforts. Bring your own food since you can't find any outlet once you start the journey. And please bring only the memories and photos. The animals are bit tough to see if you travel during the monsoon rain season, because they are plenty of water holes and they don't travel much in order to quench their thirst. So travelling during the dry season will worthy of your visit.","February 9, 2015",0.0,0.0

As other reviews have said, there are few roads and the jungle is fairly dense. You have to work hard to find and see animals and birds and its not easy to get good photos. Few other tourists. We have visited Yala three times where its an easy tourist trip but we did enjoy Wilpattu.","February 6, 2015",0.0,0.0

How is that possible? We went to Wasgomuwa NP Udawawele NP, Yala NP and Wilpattu NP and can compare these parks. We put Wilpattu on the top position with 5* mainy because there are hardly any other tourists, the park is very big, the trackers love their park ánd they have all the wildlife! We spent the wole day in the park (from 6 am to 6 pm) and were never bored! We don't think you must give 1* or 5* because you see a lot of wildlife or you didn't see any wildlife. On our day In Yala nobody saw a leopard and the day before us 4 leopards were spotted. Spotting the wildlife is not a reason for us to give 1* or 5* because th WILDlife is unpreditable. We give Wilpattu 5* because the park really gives you the feeling of being in a wild national park. It's huge, there are many different habitats and people at the ticket office, the locals, the driver and our tracker all love the park and love to welcome tourist after 25 years of war. In Yala, it's too touristic, they just want your money... Spotting a leopard in the wet season in Wilpattu is difficult and we were lucky to be the only ca (out of the 10 in the park) that day to spot a leopard. In the dry season they spot as many as 10 leopards on 1 day. Wilpattu has a lot of elephants, 3 species of deer, crocodiles, big lizards, turtles, lots of birds etc. So the park has a friendly and relaxed atmosphere and that is something Yala doesn't have at all. So, go to Wilpattu and you wil NOT be disappointed","January 7, 2015",0.0,0.0

Driver was really knowledgeable and had the eyes to spot living creatures from small birds to a big male elephant, including a variety of deers, crocodiles... but no leopard, who apparently do not like rain and wet grounds One CAVEAT, lodges around are really pricey and given the lack of competition do not offer great accommodation: we visited after our day in wilderness but decided to come back by night rather than sleep over at the park","January 2, 2015",0.0,0.0

It was very tired looking bush, all water holes were very low or dry. We saw a few water birds, a viper, monitor, a kingfisher, 2 close up eagles some wart hogs, a mongoose, a bear and some good shots of spotted deers. Oh we also came across two leopard footprints on sandy track. I have probably been spoiled with excellent wild life experiences in South America and stunning experiences in Africa but even so I was disappointed. Our driver and spotter were willing workers but lacked the skills for searching and approaching wildlife. Driving too quick through tree areas and no quick response possible to driver when one of us spotted an animal/bird. My recommendation is that it is worth going there on the chance you could be lucky but are prepared to accept that you may see very little.","December 29, 2014",0.0,0.0
