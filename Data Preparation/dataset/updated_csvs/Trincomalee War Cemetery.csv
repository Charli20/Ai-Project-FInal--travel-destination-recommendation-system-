I spoke with a caretaker of the site he told me a lot of the graves where men from an aircraft carrier that was sunk by Japanese forces out of Batticaloa. This is an excerpt from amazinglanka.com “The Trincomalee cemetery was originally the Combined Services Cemetery, but was taken over by the Admiralty from the military authorities in April 1948 for use as a permanent naval cemetery. On the withdrawal of United Kingdom Forces from Ceylon it became the property of the Ceylon Government is today maintained by the Ministry of Defense on behalf of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. The cemetery records 303 world war II causalities. Save for a few post-war and non-war graves it is purely a war cemetery, and service war graves were transferred to it from Trincomalee (St. Mary) Churchyard; Trincomalee (St. Stephen’s) Cemetery, Kottadi Cemetery, Jaffna; and Vavuiyna Combined Cemetery. A special memorial commemorates a naval man buried in Trincomalee (St. Stephen’s) Cemetery whose grave could not be found. The non-war graves are those of men of the Merchant Navy whose death was not due to war service, and of civilians, of whom some were employees of the Admiralty; while the post-war graves were dependents of servicemen, civilian employees of the Admiralty and dependents of such employees.” It’s worth a visit just to remember.","September 15, 2018",0.0,0.0
