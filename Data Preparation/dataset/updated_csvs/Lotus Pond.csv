It’s a bit off the main path, so many people miss it, but it’s a true hidden gem. The pond is nearly 1,000 years old and completely carved out of stone in the shape of a lotus flower. You can see the individual “petals” forming the steps that lead down into what used to be a pool of water. It’s a beautiful example of ancient Sri Lankan architecture and artistry. Standing there felt like stepping into a storybook or time-travel moment. The surroundings are peaceful, with trees and birds, and it’s so quiet that you can almost hear the past echoing around you. One important thing to know—there are lots of monkeys in this area! They’re cute but very cheeky. They will try to steal your food, or even your bag if you’re not careful, so keep your things close and avoid carrying snacks in your hands. It’s not a big site, but it’s definitely worth visiting if you love history, hidden spots, and beautiful, peaceful places. Tip: Go early in the day for the best light and fewer tourists. And watch your stuff around the monkeys!","July 14, 2025",0.0,0.0

It only takes a few minutes to visit but well worth it and it is superb.  An ancient pond shaped in the form of a lotus, the flower that was loved by the Buddha. Short drive from the main complex It is an interesting little bit of Medevial architecture and an important stop on the route to many other historical sites nearby. Sri Lanka is an interesting country, and the people are very friendly. It was wonderful and the design is unique and lovely. I can call it as a pleasant respite. The pond is located near the Thivanka Image House but hidden from the main attractions. It is a beautiful pond with the shape of a lotus flower and very pleasing to see the symmetrical shape. Road to pond was not paved as of now. It is in an archaeological park and it roads are being built. The pond is made of carved granite segments depicting the arrangement of lotus petals. Scallopedrings enlarges outwards from lower level to the upper. It is a marvel in design for an outdoor water feature. This featurecan is easily missed due to the artefacts being at the ground. It is a beautiful pond done during the Polonnaruwa era by the great kings for their use. Though we called them ruins, the beauty of this has not ruined. This is good and bad is that that majority are skipping this place. aThe lotus pond is one of the highlights of the visit to the Pollonaruwa site, it's just beautiful and off the track enough to appreciate it in peace, please don't visit Polonnaruwa by bike only because the LP guide says so, I saw people with red faces, nearly fainting for the hot temperature, otherwise take the bike but in early or late ours of the day This design is an unusual for a pond, with several levels to the bottom with the shape of a bloomed Lotus flower with layers of petals and it seems like one of its kind. It can be considered as a masterpiece in ancient Sri Lanka. The basic design has been followed in designing the newly done Nelum Pokuna Theatre in Colombo. It is an amazing task how it was done all those years back considering the workmanship without using modern machinery is unimaginable. This must have been hard work for the people in those years. This Lotus pond is one of the most wonderful I ever had seen. The location, a little bit far from other antics, but in the rainforest, is also interesting. I recommend you to visit Lotus Pond.","December 15, 2017",0.0,0.0
