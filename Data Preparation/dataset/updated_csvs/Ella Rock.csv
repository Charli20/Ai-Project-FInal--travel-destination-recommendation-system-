The trail itself is very manageable however poorly sign posted, granted we did the sunrise hike so it was dark and misty but even so pretty unclear. When walking we were approached by a local who informed us we were going the wrong way despite the path clearly continuing ahead and insisted we went a different direction. About 15 minutes later we were approached by another local who told us again we had gone the wrong way. Conveniently, the first man that approached us reappeared (he had clearly been following us for the last 15 minutes and had purposely sent us the wrong way). At this point he said that he would show us the way if we paid him. I had read online that this was a common scam on this trail and had also read that they could become very persistent and aggressive if you refused so when we had two men standing next to us in the dark we felt like we had no other option but to pay. We trek regularly and by no means are oppose to paying for a guide when needed but this is not a requirement for this trail and these are not guides but people setting out to deceive and scam. The whole experience is was extremely intimidating which is such a shame as I have felt extremely safe in Sri Lanka up until this point.","December 20, 2025",0.0,0.0

The trail passes through tea plantations, eucalyptus forests, and quiet railway tracks, giving hikers a glimpse of local life and natural beauty. Reaching the summit requires moderate effort, but the panoramic views make it worthwhile. On clear days, you can see rolling hills, deep valleys, and even distant waterfalls. Early morning is the best time to hike, as the weather is cooler and the views are clearer. Ella Rock is ideal for nature lovers, photographers, and travelers seeking an active escape in Sri Lanka’s hill country.","December 17, 2025",0.0,0.0

Nevertheless this is a must see. Need to have proper hiking boots, we took a local guide which was over the moon when we gave him LKS5000 (£12.50) who only wore a Sorong and flip flops (not sure how he did it) however the day albeit tiering was a great experience not to be missed. The journey started walking along the railway which was a bit unnerving, it soon became apparent that the journey was to make all other Sri Lanka hikes look like babies. The last km being the toughest. There are 2 routes, one which is an easier way but we chose the tough hike, at one point I thought my heart was going to burst out of my chest. Fab day would totally recommend.","October 30, 2025",0.0,0.0

It was dry and dusty when we did it but some parts are over bare rock and would be awful wet. Wear good trainers/hiking shoes - this isn’t one for flip flops. Take at least a litre of water each, personally I’d suggest two especially if climbing any time after 9am. There is a small ticket charge to get into the summit area with the viewpoints, presumably as it has been tidied up with the benches etc. (970rp as of Sept 2025 - the ticket box had plenty of change). As others have said - the locals are deliberately concealing the start of the trail/destroying the markers and will also deliberately misdirect you to extort money. The photo I’ve included is what is currently blocking the start of the trail as you cross the footbridge after coming along the tracks from Kithalella (the branches) - go past these a little and bear to the left through the tea plantation (the trail as marked on Google maps is actually pretty accurate), don’t pass the house as you’ll be directed further into the forest the wrong way. Hopes this saves someone else the misdirection from the locals! There are a couple of locals selling coconuts/cold drinks at fair prices on the marked part of the trail - handy on the way down!","September 28, 2025",0.0,0.0

However, we did encounter one of those locals that initially points the way and then follows at a distance to aggressively take over at the first uncertain fork in the unmarked trail. We actually let him do this because it saved us time enough to make it up before sunrise, even though we had a downloaded map. If you don't like this, and I imagine most would not, and you have a downloaded map, be sure to politely say right away you already know the way and make it clear you won't be tipping.  On your own expect to stop at a lot of unmarked forks to determine the right one because the tea fields naturally have a lot of worker paths and in the dark it's hard to see where they all go, but it isn't that hard. You will also go right by front doors of homes and near other buildings so don't think you made a mistake just because of that. Sometimes the correct fork in the road is the narrow path through the weeds.","September 13, 2025",0.0,0.0

The tourist who only goes 500m on concrete lanes to the attraction, will suffer here. The trained hikers will find the number of tourists on the trail annoying. You're not alone, but it's certainly not a flight of stairs up. For our family a very varied walk, especially if you make a loop trail where the second part of the loop is off the beaten track.

The visit itself was spectacular and will be a memorable family moment for years to come. Here are some travel tips that may help you: (1) The view of the Ella Rock is best seeing from the spot where the Flying Ravana (Zipline/Swing & Little Adams Peak) are located. This is all in the same location at the top of the same steep hill. Autos are able to take you to the top where you can explore all three attractions. The walk to the top is not a short one and quite steep. There are little stalls/shops selling water and snacks along this hill. The drive is bumpy but it's a lovely view of the Ella Rock and the high elevation/and green landscape. * The view of the Ella rock at the top is spectacular (as you can see from my photos). If you choose to climb Little Adam's Peak, make it a separate trip and go early in the morning (for the sunrise, or around that time) as the afternoon sun can be quite hot. * Both my children did the Swing at the top, by the Ravana Pool Club (noted in (1) and it was fabulous experience for them (and for us watching them). We did not rent the dresses as my daughter took her own. This is a must do if you enjoy heights and want to get some memorable photos of the incredible view of the Ella Rock. Take an Umbrella in case it’s very sunny so that you can shield yourself from the heat. The Ravana Pool Club is beautiful if you want to get a drink or a bite to eat. Costs are $$$ on the scale. The use of the Ravana Pool Club swimming pool is based on a package deal which you can buy at the entrance of the club, at the top of this hill (Cost is $$$$) (2) The Nine Arches bridge is in a separate location not too far from the Flying Ravana/Swing area. The Auto's are able to take u right to the top where you can walk to the bridge in a few minutes. * If you get Auto's offering you 'package deals' to visit the (1) & (2) above - it should not cost more than Rs. 8,000 for two people to visit both locations. (Unfortunately, because we didn't know the distance between the locations, we ended up paying more than double this price for 4 adults. Lesson learned for next time :) Other Tips for your stay in Ella: * Booking a hotel in Ella Town makes it very convenient to travel to the Ella Rock, and other attractions and restaurants. * The commute from our hotel in Ella Town to the Ella Rock (which is viewable from the Ravana Pool Club / Flying Ravan) was about 10-15 mins (or less from our Hotel). My suggestion is: if you have a driver who can take u to the base of the Ravana Pool Club/Flying Ravana, you can get an auto at the base of the road and only pay about Rs 1,000 - Rs. 1,200 which will drive you to the Top of the hill to view the Rock/Visit Ravana Pool Club/experience the Flying Ravana zip line /Swing (All in the exact same location beside each other). * While there are no 'mosquitoes or bugs flying around visibly', the area is rich in biodiversity, dense with numerous varieties of flora and fauna - which could cause bug bites (especially if you are new to the country/and travelling with children). Make sure to take some After bit cream and to dress comfortably. Any other question - don’t hesitate to reach out and enjoy your trip :)","September 19, 2024",0.0,0.0

I echo what the others warn about scammers. While I didn’t  face these scammers, I heard directly from hikers that experienced it - notably being taken on dubious routes only to be asked for money to be taken on the correct path. The route is pretty easy to follow via markings and Google maps, once you leave the railway tracks and cross the bridge. One other thing to note is that there is a 930 LKR entrance fee. Make sure the ticket guy actually issues you with a ticket once you paid.

We were seemingly helpfully pointed down a track by locals and the ruse was then taken over by a local lady who continued to send us the wrong way then ""rescued"" us, ""guided"" us and then stopped on the track and demanded money.

We were unsure if it was worth getting a tour guide at first - but I’m so glad we did, I don’t think I would have felt comfortable hiking in the dark without one and it meant that we stayed on the right track and made it to the top for the sunrise. Our guide was organised by our hotel. We started the hike at the railway track and made it to the top in about an hour and a half. The climb itself is manageable but suitably challenging, although we might have felt that more because we were pushing ourselves to get to the top in time! At the top you have to pay a small environmental fee and there are toilets nearby. When you see the sun rise it is so worth it, you are surrounded by mountains and the view is breathtaking.

From here the route is easier to follow and a couple of options will lead you to the same place at the top. Stray dogs actually led us! Very friendly and don’t bark at all. Couple of guys selling fruit and drinks on the way up if you wanted to support them. 3 view points, one is early on and finally the trees drop away to a valley on the left. Very nice but keep going through the trees to a log cabin and camping area where you find view 2. From here keep going past another house, A frame style and you eventually come to a tiny view point in the grass where the path stops. This is nice but worth the extra walk maybe not. It took us 2hr 30 in total including plenty of photos stops and we sat for 20-30 mins at the to to eat.

I highly recommend getting a guide, as the trail isn’t obvious or straightforward and the hike starts on some railroad tracks, so it’s good to have a local who knows the train schedule. The whole hike takes about 2 - 3 hours. I made the mistake of not respecting the elevation and needed to take a longer rest than normal from exertion. The second half is fairly vertical and requires some decent work. We started around 8am and it’s wasn’t too hot. The sunrise views require getting started about 5am. If you’re not keen on the sunrise then a 7am start should afford a more comfortable hike experience. The main peak has a water vendor and amazing views, but be sure to walk along the ridge for a second vista.

Many locals had told us that it was pretty easy, but there is no clear path. We were told that it was due to a lack of tourists during the pandemic. A guy offered to be our guide and ww took him up on it. We are very glad we did as it just made everything easier and we could just focus on the hike. We hiked to the top without breaks but it was challenging and sweaty - you also have to be aware that you will have to deal with leeches. Try to prevent the worst by wearing proper shoes and long socks and just keep an eye out for the suckers. Our guide was very helpful with removing them as well. The view from the top is breathtaking. There are actually two viewpoints five minutes apart. One is the ""official"" where it seems like they are building a camp site but we actually preferred the other one which about five minutes to the right of the Ella Rock viewpoint.

You need to go around 40 min along the train tracks, from Ella train station, to Kithalela train station, then another 10 minutes on the train tracks until you see a small shop on the left side which sells juices & fruits. After that store, you need to go another ~400m and take left, cross a bridge and walk through a tea plantation. The path gets a bit steep afterwards as you walk through an eucalyptus forest.

We did get quite lost at first, but this was mainly because of a cheeky local confusing us. They want to show you the way so you pay them a guide fee, so they tell you you're going the wrong way / your map is wrong! We ended up turning left too soon so we went a route without a path which wasnt ideal but we made it with the help of some stray dogs! We missed sunrise but it didn't matter. If you want to make it up for sunrise you would need to set off about 4am, and I think it would be best to get a guide as finding the route in the dark was hard. You need to keep going past the train station until you get to a path which takes you across a bridge over the water. Then it's a clear path! The views were incredible and it was only us up there (about 7.30am). When we were leaving some locals were setting up a stall and gave us some fruit and wouldn't take any money from us! They sell water and coconuts up there too incase you don't have any. The route down was super easy and you couldnt really get lost. It was starting to get pretty hot so I would definitely recommend going early, the views are better then too. A must do hike whilst in Ella!

Go under the net and carry on via a path through different scenery including long grass and then rocky climbs among the trees up to the top.

Continue on path past tea plantations. In 5-7 mins you will see the first ‘Ella Rock’ signpost. 6. Now you go mostly up through forest.

Attaching a map my hotel guy shared with me. This map is pretty much self explanatory and the trek can be done by self without a guide. But people looking for a sunrise trek may opt for a guide because the trek can be little tricky in the dark. One can take a wring turn and get lost in the jungle without a guide. - DONT ask for directions to locals as they may charge heavy after they are done with helping. - DONT let someone local follow you for helping. They will charge crazy after you are done with the trek. - Some locals wait for you to het lost/make u get lost in jungle so that they can guide you and charge money. So either take a guide or be sure of the map before you go. Or if you are getting some help discuss the price beforehand. The hike starts with walk on the railway tracks and then on the tea garden and then in the jungles. The hike is fairly easy except the last 500 meters.

You'd have to be pretty stupid to miss the massive trains that occasionally go by but do keep your wits about you, especially if crossing the bridge bit. Also watch out for malevolent locals who try and tell you the wrong way to go so you end up paying for a guide. From what we could see, once you leave the train tracks, cross the river and hit the tea plantations, there are two routes to take. One leads straight up the ridge first through the tea fields (this is the main route everyone should take). The other (which we took) loops round to the right and involves a climb up a steep hill following red arrows with not another soul in sight bar some local cafe owner telling you you're going the right way. I'm pretty sure he made that route so you go past his shop. Confusingly signs point you in both directions but either way, eventually you make it to the viewing point and then there's a steep 30 min climb to the top.

The hike up itself took us about 75-80 minutes, and another 60 to get down. For the route itself, there are plenty of resources on the web to help you figure your way up. It’s best to have a read on these before proceeding if you go guideless (entirely possible). The general principle is to make your way to the top of the ridge line (sometimes called a tree line in the reviews) as quickly as possible, then to follow along it until the steep part of Ella Rock where the real ascent begins. Walking on the side of the ridge (which we tried on the way down) was less pleasant and had no views to boast of. All the best!","April 15, 2019",0.0,0.0

We left at around 8.30am to try to escape the heat (we didn't!) and soon realised that trying to escape day time heat in Sri Lanka was virtually impossible. We didn't use a guide and found our way based on photographs that were shown to us by our friendly waiter at the Ella Heritage hotel where we went for breakfast even though we were staying somewhere else. (Would consider staying here next time as it's set on a quiet road and in a beautiful English-looking cottage). I already had some idea of the route based on what I found on the net, but found those photographs were way more useful since we saw no blue arrows or benches that were mentioned online. A local lady even ""helpfully"" pointed us in the WRONG direction. The first 3km is a very easy walk on the railway track and you have to pass the Kithaella train station and walk for a further stretch before there is a path on the left by a mango tree which you want to take. There is a shack selling drinks and snacks (cheapest coconut drink for only 80 LKR on the whole route). From there you will cross a bridge, and unlike some blogs that direct you to the right of the bridge, you take a left past a termite hill and from there just keep moving, taking a right when you come to a fork. As you move further along you will come to a cafe (coconut drinks for an exorbitant 150LKR here!). Continue moving past it and from here things start becoming steeper and you will see lovely views from the ridge with the forest behind you. Beyond this is a more challenging climb which would take between 15-20 minutes up some steep and rocky terrain before you reach the top where you will also be able to get drinks (not sure about prices here). We were awed by the breathtaking views and saw Little Adam's Peak which we had done the day before looking very diminutive and were suitably satisfied with ourselves for making it up to Ella Rock. It was a little tricky going down the steep bits but knowing that it was only going to be for a short distance was comforting. Overall I would highly recommend doing this and would most definitely recommend a moderate fitness level, good hiking shoes, sun protection, a towel to wipe off your perspiration, and plenty of water. I didn't think to bring my hiking poles but felt they would've come in handy at the last bit so if you have some foldable ones I would say take them along!","March 27, 2019",0.0,0.0

In a nutshell: complete RIP OFF. They TRICK you into getting a 'guide' and you CAN'T TRUST the signs. DON'T GO by sunset, we have met more than a few who got completely LOST in the woods (you can't see the sun anyway since it's on the other side of the mountain). My friends and I (three girls) wanted to climb the Ella rock without a guide for sunset. The tuctuc driver didn't drop us off at the usual spot and instead brought us to a shortcut. We only found out later and realised it was all part of their trick. There aren't any signs which way to walk and if there are signs, they're wrong. A local guy offered us that we could walk with him because he wanted to go there anyway. Long story short: In the end we wanted to thank him by paying him 600 LKR. First he played nice and refused the money but we insisted. He kept talking for a while and then we realised he wanted 3000 LKR. After a discussion he left agrily with the 600 LKR. We walked back with a couple who had to pay 400 LKR on the way up to a lady who told them the right way. When they didn't have more money, she led them wrong. We walked back to Ella on the train tracks for 45 minutes until someone told us that we were being followed by someone. It was the same guy who led us up to the rock accompanied by a friend. We don't know what their plan was but we made sure to stay with others all the way back.","March 12, 2019",0.0,0.0

From here it is fairly well marked and you will see enough tourists to be able to find your way. It’s a challenging uphill on roughly marked and fairly loose soil so wear good shoes. Not suitable for anybody with significant mobility problems. View at the top is fantastic but what’s even better is the second view point a little further past the forest.

The walk takes around 3 hours and you can start it from the town of Ella. You walk along the railway lines, until you have crossed the metal bridge. From there you turn left down an embankment, across the river and turn right. You need to walk through very tall grasses and it is difficult to judge the pathway. Thankfully there are often other people who you can follow. I would advise using Maps.me which has a number of pathways plotted and saves you getting lost. The view from the top is beautiful and I would recommend going to both view points which are on different sides of the summit. The first viewpoint you reach has two fresh juice and coconut seller which is a lovely reward after your hard work. I would recommend wearing shoes with good grip.

It takes about 2 hours each way from Ella railway station and the latter section of the walk is fairly steep and rugged going but should be manageable for most people. We’re in our late-50s and of average fitness and we got up there ok. The route is really quite. Follow the railway tracks from Ella railway station in the direction of Kandy for about 40 minutes to Kitalella station. About 200 metres beyond Kitalella there is a track on the left that makes a had u-turn back on itself. Take this and cross the bridge over the waterfall. Immediately after the bridge take a left fork. This is the place where you may go working as the right hand fork appears to be the main track and even has a white signpost to the rock. Ignore this and instead look up the hillside for a yellow sign for “Ella Rock - Map Route” and head towards this. Thereafter it’s just a matter of following this track without deviation. You’ll wander through a lovely tea plantation to start with and about half way you will pass a cafe/shop on the left. After this the going starts to get tougher. Just keep going and you’ll get there. One important point, just before Kitalella station there are touts who will try to divert you on an alternative route and offer to guide you for a price. Just ignore them and keep on with these directions. Once at the summit the views are superb but the area isn’t huge and can get crowded. If you pass the summit t9 the right and walk on through the woods then after about 10 minutes you will come to a second and lessvisited viewpoint.","February 21, 2019",0.0,0.0

It is a relatively tough walk to the top but the views are amazing and totally worth it. The only downside it that one section of the route is difficult to follow. It is not worth paying a guide, but be prepared to give the locals a small tip to help you out. The start of the path (45mins) is along the train tracks which is really cool (and safer than it sounds). A short distance from the tracks is Kithal Ella falls which are quite beautiful. The lonely planet guide book suggests you climb from there however this section is impossible to follow so we recommend you return to the train tracks and continue on for a short while until you reach the main path. We tried to climb from the falls and got very lost in thick jungle and had to tip a local to take us up to the main path. Once you are back on the main path the bulk of the climb is very easy to follow. The path is well worn with lots of groups heading up, but it is loose in places and so good footwear (trainers or better) is essential. Don't wear flip flops. The views at the top are amazing, and there is a second viewing platform another 15 mins on if you continue on the same path. The total climb took us 1.5 hours as we are regular hikers and quite fit. I would expect for it to take 2 - 2.5 hours if you don't hike regularly.

We did the whole thing on foot, which starts at the Train Station and requires about a 30 minute walk down the Train Tracks to an odd little statue, where you venture in.  Generally there are locals, many of which will offer to show you the way, don't be fooled, it's not for free.  Some may even tail you to see if you get lost, then again offer to be your guide. The track in initially is not an easy one, and,yes you could get lost, but being a well traveled track you are likely to come across other travelers heading up or back from the top, so ask them were to next.  Once you hit the forest, life is a bit easier, as you simply follow the ridge to the top.  What gave us hope we were heading the right way is that we picked up a guide of sorts, that ran just ahead of us, a local DOG.  So he stayed with us right to the top and was paid in biscuits. Once at the top the view is stunning, we could look across the valley to our actual accommodation.  Once at the top there are vendors selling Tea or Water. Heading back is still as tricky, navigation wise, as it's not a clear route, and will generally offer others heading up directions on where you had just come from. The whole trip will take 2 &1/2 to 3 hours.  It is much longer that heading up Little Adams Peak, but no more challenging. I have not recommended this as a place to watch the sunset as it was hard enough navigating back in daylight.","January 31, 2019",0.0,0.0

The views from the top are amazing and make the hike worthwhile. I was unsure whether to attempt it as people we chatted with said how tough it was but honestly anyone with moderate fitness could do it. The bit I didn't like was the locals in the area who seem to deliberately try to get tourists lost so that they can approach you later and be your guide. We didn't get a guide and ignored advice offered from locals that we were going the wrong way and signs telling us to take turns that we knew to be incorrect.

Practically everyone does it from what I can tell, and most go early morning to avoid the heat of the day, so expect it to get pretty busy at times.  There are a few routes up, I'd recommend the short-but-steep route up through the tea plantations (TA won't allow me to add the URL, but for the best guide Google 'ella rock hike' and it's the top hit!) Once you're off the railway line and you start climbing up, it can get a bit steep and rocky at times - just keep going!  While the bottom section is a bit more exposed, the top (steep) section is most shaded in the trees, which makes things fractionally easier!  It will test you a little though, but as long as you've got appropriate footwear pretty much anyone should be able to do it!  The views from the top are well worth it.

The gentle incline, looping around the horseshoe lee of the landscape, crossing waterfalls and rivers and seeing local life. Approaching the correct turn off is a tricky business. Some wiley local farmers tried to tempt us down another path, with a shrewd offering of cafe's and waterfalls. Persavere with your route, and just past a small outpost station and before the sign to a hostel, is a track to the left, that almost double backs on itself. This is the one, and once on the route well signposted with it. More wandering through local life, into a woodland more akin to the West Berkshire countryside, than tropical Ella. The climb starts here, with breathtaking glimpses as you ascend, sweating prufously but well shaded, before reaching the climax of the rock. A beautiful vista, superior in height and scope to little Adams peak and with the added benefit of some locals selling coconuts and fruit juices. There are further view points along the ridge, which are also worth pressing on to. As per my maps.me app, there is another couple of ways down. But be advised: one route dribbles to little more than an overgrown deer path, ditching you at a stream. On t'other side of stream, is the same wiley gentleman who tried to tempt us down the path earlier on. A swift bribe of 100lkr and we were out of his professed garden and onto the tracks, Mrs Johnson more vocally unimpressed than the good natured couple from Belgium, who we had collected on route.

From Ella station we walked left on the tracks, during this walk we saw a group of wild monkeys, a peacock crossed the tracks right in front of us, some pretty looking birds, and a lot of dogs as has become the norm for this trip. We kept walking until we crossed a metal railway bridge, just after that in the left was a shrine and just past that was a pathway down to a building, if you take that pathway you will come to a waterfall for some great views. From there cross the bridge and follow one of the several paths up the hill, don’t take the path on the left though. Once up the hill there was a clearing, head down on your right past a blue barrel and there will be a small path at the bottom of the hill, you will reach a cross road, turn left and keep walking. You will pass the “cafe” that is on maps.me (it didn’t serve any proper food, just drinks and snacks and there is a basic toilet), keep walking up and you will be on your way to the peak of Ella rock. It’s a fairly easy climb if you are reasonably fit and able, mainly covered by trees so you can find shade to stop to rehydrate. I saw one child going up but I wouldn’t say this is one for kids. When you reach the top the views are breathtaking, there will be the main viewing point by the log cabin where you can also buy juices but behind the cabin is a path to take you to some other viewing points and a shrine.

You then take a path through a fields of crops. On the side of this path is a little refreshment shack. There is a man called Jude selling spices and he will happily give you good directions up the mountain. Everyone else sends you in the wrong direction as they want you to hire them to take you to the top. It is quite a long walk until you arrive at a viewing point which is absolutely spectacular.

You will go past a train station and then a few hundred metres after the station on your left hand side, look out for a rock with a U shaped dirt path.   Take this path.  You will then cross over a bridge and see signs for Ella rock - all pointing you in different directions!    We took the right hand side and made it and on our descent we ended up on the path that would of been the left hand path they all pretty much take you there. On the right hand path we approached the ‘farmers restaurant’ and at this point where the path forked again we kept right almost doing a U turn around the field by the restaurant.  About 40 meters you can see a house built just about you and a path leading up to this - take this path.

You walk from your accommodation so stay close to the centre, or on the western side of Ella to save a bit of walking time. We left Ella Rock House around 8:30am and walked up via Waterfall Road, crossing onto the train tracks where they are only a couple of metres from the road. From there we walked through to Kital Ella station and kept a lookout for the ""tea road"" which is a sharp turn back to the left a couple of hundred metres past Kital Ella station. The tea road is a wider walking track than various other walking tracks exiting the railway. After a short distance on the tea road, there's a bridge across the river and then you're in the tea plantations and starting to climb. Almost immediately you reach a junction with signs pointing to the ""map main road"" to the left and to the ""nearest road"" to the right. The ""map main road"" is the most obvious route with the biggest volume of traffic so it's hard to get lost if you take this route. We took the ""nearest road"" which is a short-cut and we had a Sri-Lankan in our party so when the obvious route disappeared, there were no more signs and we found ourselves in an old lady's back yard, he was able to get directions quickly and without any issues. We walked off-track for a short distance but by that time we could see walkers on the main route so it was just a matter of following a ridgeline through open forest to connect. It was a very nice route through market gardens as well as tea plantations and definitely shorter and cooler than the main route but best to go with a local if heading that way. We connected with the main route at an open point that we'd seen the previous day from Little Adams Peak, with open eucalyptus forest behind us. After a few pics we started the main climbing section, which is a bit arduous but okay if you don't push too hard. We were at the top before 11am and the views were definitely worth the effort. We enjoyed fresh coconuts before walking another 250m or so to a shrine and another look-out which was also spectacular. We started our walk back down the road section a bit further to look at a track we'd seen a couple of guides use. It was a bit longer but not as arduous as the main track, I would stay with the main track rather than take this route if going up again. We followed the main route the rest of the way back, definitely obvious all the way down so if walking without a guide or a local friend it's the best option.","August 22, 2018",0.0,0.0

I'm glad I didn't, though. The climb was OK until you got near the top, then it got much harder and steeper. It was well worth it, though! Do: Get up early! I left about 7.30am and it was reasonably quiet at the top. By the time I was heading down, there was almost a constant stream of people going up and I can imagine it got quite packed at the top! Do your research before you go - it's perfectly do-able without a guide, but you need to know where you're going and what markers to look for so that you don't get lost/ led astray by 'locals' or conned into taking on someone as a guide part way up! There are some detailed directions in some of the TripAdvisor reviews, which worked for me. You'll probably also see other walkers along the way who you can check with. Go with someone else - I started off on my own and, thankfully, met another lady on her own soon after I started. I would have felt like an easy target for some of the people trying to become 'guides' on the way up had I been on my own and some parts are quite secluded. Plus, it's more fun with company! Take a camera - the views are spectacular! And there are some lovely view points along the way too. Take PLENTY of water and some snacks! Take a walk along the top - there's a shrine and another lookout point another easy 5-10 minute walk to the right of where you first arrive at the top. Don't: Get misled by the 'locals' who are trying to tell you where to go - have directions you trust and stick to them! Fret about how to get back down - we ended up going back down a different way, but as long as you know you're heading towards the train tracks, you'll be fine!","August 19, 2018",0.0,0.0

We saw red signs on the tracks showing this. There are also locals sat near a white structure who also tell you to turn left at this point - ignore them as it is not the right way to go. You need to continue down the tracks, past kithalella station. There are small white waymarker signs along the track. Walk past the 166 1/2 sign, there is then a sharp turn to the left which is almost slightly back on yourself but take that.

You must do this hike when you are in Ella! Although I would not recommend this hike with small kids or kids over 8 years old who are very whiny. Some tips: - take a picture of the train hours, so you know when to expect a train on the tracks you will be walking. - go early. It gets crowded at the top around noon. This is dangerous and not ideal for pictures. - wear sunscreen. The walk on the tracks is with little or no shade, the walk up Ella rock however is true the forest so you will not have a lot of sunshine. - don't listen too local guys who give you directions without you asking them. They could trick you, so you get lost and feel desperate enough to hire them as a guide - you have to pass 1 train station. Than you continue to follow the tracks (you will have rock on your right side and vegitation on your left side) and after a few minutes you will see a path on your left side. It's very easy to miss because it's a very sharp turn do pay attention. This is when you have to leave the tracks and enter the forest. I used some blogs too find my way. I highly recommend you do some research and use a blog aswell because it's easy to get lost. But that makes it more of an adventure, right?

The varying vistas along the way plus the spectacular view at the top make it a 'must do' hike.   The heat makes it a bit tougher but there are plenty of places to catch some welcome breeze along the way, and I recommend setting out earlier in the day. We left at 8am and felt sorry for those only starting out at 11am. I found it a little tough (not a hiker) but the rest of the family were fine. Allow about 3-4 hours so you can spend some time relaxing and taking in the spectacular view at the top (and along the way) - the reward for your efforts. We set off on foot from the centre of Ella along the train tracks for quite a long way to the base of the hill.  We had our driver as a guide but I did not see another option and there was a steady stream of hikers doing the same.  The walk along the tracks was interesting and enjoyable - past homestays, farms and we spotted lots of birds, butterflies and the occasional monkey. It would have been quite confusing to know where to go. Many tourists seemed to get lost, and resorted to hiring a 'guide' on the way up.  They didn't look happy.  Others spotted us with our Sri Lankan driver and tagged along (clever).  As you would expect it is a climb and I found it challenging towards the very end where the terrain is quite steep. Before that was okay.  Bring water, but there is a spot towards the top (before the last steep climb) to buy drinks, and you can buy water or fresh coconut at the very top. Terrain includes railway tracks, packed dirt, steps, rocks - but it was a little slippery so good shoes with grip required. We were able to lightly jog some of the way down!  Very worthwhile - lots of amazing vistas at every step.","July 11, 2018",0.0,0.0

At this point a “tracker” arrived who took us to Ella rock. We trekked through pathways that were not pathways.

But this is much harder to climb. But if you are in good health you can do it without much hassle. It’s not hard to find the route. Walk from Ella railway station towards kandy side. After about 2km you will find the kithala ella sub station. Just after the station there’s a path to your left in the shape of a ‘U’. Go through it and after the bridge take the left which goes up towards the tea fields. Locals might trick you and show wrong paths and will charge you to take you to top once you get lost. You don’t need a guid to climb Ella rock. Final part of the climb is challenging but doable. Within 2 hours of time you will be able to reach top. Carry plenty of water and some light snacks. There are some vendors at top as well but their price can be very high. Views are awesome from the top. Just in front of you would be the little Adams peak and you can see some distance from the top. There’s another view point also in a distance of about 800m from the main view point. Don’t forget to reach there as well. Views are much better from there. You can see the upper part of ravana falls also from this second view point. Try to do the climb in morning time before it gets hot.,"July 5, 2018",0.0,0.0

There are people there that will offer to help you. They are scammers and were extremely abusive to me when I said we were fine. Please note that these people are not from Ella. They are people from other villages trying to trick tourists. The people from Ella are wonderful. Continue along the tracks passed Kithalella train station which is on your right. It’s hard to miss. Keep going along the tracks. If you see a white sign with 166 1/2, you are on the right track. Eventually you will come to a dirt road on your left. This will eventually lead you to a small bridge. At the end of that bridge go LEFT. There is a sign to go right but I think it leads to a cafe rather than the desired destination. From there you are on your way to the top. It’s a beautiful view.

U can get so many guesthouse, dorm, hotel, hostel in this areas. Lot of international tourists so play with the price for maked reasonable. Prepared cash because most of this accommodation can't accept card. 4) Start hiking early morning is a good choice. I'm start hiking 5.30am. 5) For facilitate climbing, walk follow the train route (from Ella Station train). That is easier way to follow the step. 6) 5-10 minutes walk after Kithalella Station, u will find a small passage to the top of the ella rock, just follow the step. 7) 45-60 minutes after climb, u will be in the top of Ella Rock. Explore the top because there have 2 or 3 top view side of the rock. 8) Don't worry if u don't bring mineral water or just finished it because there's a ""tea stall"" on the top. Can buy a cup tea or mineral for Rs100. 9) Wearing a properly entirely for hiking is help a lot (climbing shoes and long pant because on the way to climb there are pile of weeds). 10) Just beware some of the local people will try ""helping"" if u are lost by show the step/way.

The path continues up from here, if unsure the café staff can generally be trusted to point you in the right direction, but it wasn't rocket science to figure out. After reaching the first lookout, the path continues along the saddle of the mountain, then you have a steep rocky section to hike up. You will then come to a wide track at the top of this, turn left and you are there. There is another cafe at the top of the mountain. Be sure to check the price before accepting anything, as the prices are as steep as the hike itself. Follow the exact same path down. Staff at the first café advised of an alternative route down but this proved to be incorrect.

It’s a steep rocky climb. Majority of the hike is fine, however when you get to the bottom of Ella Rock it’s a very steep gradient up. It lasts about 30-40mins. 2. Read an online guide to hike Ella Rock. Altas and Boots have a thorough guide including GPS map. You don’t need to hire a guide it is not that difficult. 3. If you don’t read the guide beware there are NO SIGNS. And it would be easy to get lost making you vulnerable to touts that will demand an outrageous fee. Don’t trust anyone who says they will show you the way. They will demand compensation at the end. This is a larger issue I think visitors need to be more vocal about with the Ella local council or tourism committee. Ella has thousands of tourists coming through for hiking yet there are no route markers, no signage, no free maps easily available. They are profiting from the the tourist dollar yet spending zero back on the tourist draw cards. Also this further allows touts to take advantage of lost hikers. 3. The second viewing point is nicer than the first in my opinion.  At the top you can take a loop around and I saw three different viewpoints. 4. If you can spare a few bucks buy a juice up the top.","May 20, 2018",0.0,0.0

Having said that I thought it was 6km return hike, actually 13km round trip, so proud of me :) There is also a Buddha cave, a forest walk & beautiful waterfall to climb down to see.

The walk starts along the train tracks, winding up gradually (and relatively moderately) through the tea plantations. As you near the summit the climb steepens and intensifies, with the path becoming rockier and more difficult to navigate. However, it was easier than we expected from the guidebooks we'd read - I'd say that only about the last third/quarter of the hike is challenging. I also don't think that a guide is really necessary - we easily found our way on our own based on directions from blogs (there are quite a few that set out possible routes). That being said, bear in mind that there are no route markers. Allow 3.5 to 4 hours or the hike, including time to take in the views (which are worth the walk!). An early start is highly recommended to avoid walking in the heat. We set off at 05:30, but in hindsight I would've made it at least 30 minutes earlier.

You'll have to navigate through some tea plants and there are many paths that work, just keep heading towards Ella Rock (biggest mountain). 4) From the ""Cafe"" head up the path in between it an the mountain (or ask someone/cafe man) and it gets difficult from here but stay on that path and head for the top! 5) Make sure you check out a few different view points while at the top, there are a few trails to follow!

Personally we thought having a guide was well worth the 2000 rupees as it added much to the overall experience. Breathtaking views at the top, rugged walking and much better than just following a path or climbing stairs (Adams peak and little Adams peak), a proper hike. This is well worth the effort.

It’s the scammers who deliberately misinform you and lead you a complicated way in order to make you think you need to keep them as a guide. The scammers wait in a group just after the (a little scary if you’re afraid of heights) railway bridge crossing which is about 30-mins from Ella train station. They sit just above a path to the left which has a little shop selling water visible from the tracks. Even though we had downloaded a guide that said we needed to walk on for a further 10-mins on the train tracks (past the little train station called Kital Ella), we were sucked in by the very genuine lady telling us that Ella Rock was a left turn here. Which we did. We followed this path for about 10-mins through some overgrowth at times only to be caught up by a local person saying we were going the wrong way and to follow them to get to the right path. This guy looked so honest and genuine that we followed him back. He then proceeded to take us an a very complicated (& longer as we later discovered) route through the tea plantations until we came out about 25 mins from the top and hit the very obvious real path. We then had the necessary haggle about him wanting paying etc.... quite a few people were in the same boat as we carried on. On the way back, we followed the path easily and came out on the tracks exactly where we were headed for before we were misinformed about the route. On the way back on the tracks....sure enough, there was our guy - in a change of clothes - waiting for his next target alongside several others.

Go early in the morning to avoid the crowds and fog, cause once the haze comes you will see nothing. The climb itself is not that hard and is very enjoyable. Just take plenty of water and suncream. If you want to prolong your trip, go to see Ravana Falls. But get to the Upper Part! They are way more beautiful and without tourists, as they are on a private land. They are not that easy to find, but it is worth the effort. At the top of Ella Rock turn left on the path. Keep the direction and walk on the ridge until you get to the Forest Monastery. The path divides into 2 or 3 directions here, turn left, slightly down from the hill. It is like you get out of the forest, go until you see a very old looking low stone wall. Turn left, down from the hill here and keep this direction. Many times you will lose the wall in the bush but keep trying and you will find it again. Open street maps will help you a lot, the path is marked there and I think MAPS.ME shows the way as well. After 20 mins it gets you to a road, there is a sign and a locked gate to the private land here. On the sign there are several numbers ( 077 531 2276 is one of them). Call and someone will come shortly to open the gate for you. After paying 500 Rupies you will be taken for a tour. The waterfall from here is magnificent and you will get a private bath in the natural pool right under the waterfall. You can stay as long as you like, just be aware of leeches, they really suck!

Trees, flowers, tea fields, and a half way view point.

When you pass the small cabin at the top walk in from of it and continue on the small path that takes you to the second viewpoint. You will walk throught a beautiful stand of trees. When you reach the tree that looks like a natural hammock. That is the second viewpoint. We spent about an hour there without seeing anyone else. The main rock is very crowded.

It's a little tricky to find the right trail. I did this a few months ago now so the memory is not as fresh for my exact trail but I find the tour on a blog online which laid it out perfectly. Someone posted a map in the photos that is really useful as well so recommend doing a little research in advance. The main point is on the rail tracks look for 166 1/2 mile marker, on left, keep walking until you see Yellow 15kmh sign and right behind it although slightly obscured by long grass is a 166 1/4 sign, this is where you turn off. I'll include pics of it below.  You cross a bridge and head on up. it seems the locals purposefully keep it tricky to find so tourists will hire a local guide to bring them up. I set out quite early just after 6am. My hostel is right on the train tracks so just matter of walking until the turn off. Clouds tend to come in after the morning but luckily for me the views were perfect. It took about 90 minutes to reach the top from my hostel. As I went early I had it to myself, the views are sensational and much better than Little Adam's peak imo.

If your are going to Ella Rock by train (From Colombo), get down in Kithal Ella Station. The station before Ella railway station. A small station. Less facilities.

It took us 4 hours there and back from our central Ella hotel. That included plenty of stops and a 15 minute rest at the summit. For those nervous of doing it, my wife has a bad knee and coped ok. A 90 minute comfortable walk gets you to the final challenging climb so walk there, take in the view and decide how you’re feeling! The route we took was per the advice  below. Along the train tracks from Ella station, Beyond the metal bridge, past the station and about 300 meters past the 166.5 sign, a sharp left at the granite rock. The rock is obvious - so keep going on the railway if you are unsure. It’s highly unlikely you’ve missed it. Very soon after turning Left you’ll see a small bridge over pretty rapids so that’s your confirmation you took the right turn. After  that follow your nose through the tea plantation and up to the base of the climb. This takes 30 mins ish. We made a couple of wrong turns but the terrain is ok so a couple of mistakes does you no harm. If you go the wood route - look out for the monkeys chilling from the heat. Contrary to other accounts on here we found the locals helpful in pointing us the right way. If in Doubt, buy a drink from one of the huts and ask your seller the way to go - he has less motive to lead you astray! Also - there was an annoying seller near the summit sounding a regular horn - if in doubt follow the noise! Final 20 min summit is comfortable if you’re reasonably fit and injury free. Even if you’re neither of those, there is no rush and plenty of spaces to catch your breath. We walked 10-2 which I’d suggest is the latest for the morning stint as the heat kicked in on the route back. Enjoy. We loved it.","February 4, 2018",0.0,0.0

I must say, I don’t agree with any of those sentiments! With some slight trepidation, we set off relatively early, 7.30/8am and made our way down the tracks. Having read numerous reviews I was half expecting to be ambushed by ‘The locals’ en route to the top.... all we saw was a few people trying to make a bit of extra money off a captive audience. We walked down the tracks until the turning just after Kittal Ella and turned off the path which started to lead us over the bridge and into the mountains. We didn’t see anyone trying to tell us we were going the wrong way or trying to enforce their navigation skills on us, but that’s just our experience. I would say wear appropriate footwear, my wife wore some with minimal grip and you really do need grip to get to the top, but more to get back down! There are two routes, as everyone mentions and we plucked for the shorter; more direct route. When we reached the summit there was a couple of people there, however, by the time we walked down at 11am, there were scores of people making the trip up - highlighting the need, or lack thereof, of a guide. That being said, if you want one, that’s cool, we went wrong a little, but got back on track pretty quickly. On the route back down we stopped off for a coconut at the shack and took in some of the views and then went for some lunch.

It's all more or less endurable until the very last part that just killed me. Having said that, my friend - the avid trekker - literally ran up it. Show off (*queue scowl*). There are two routes to the top, both follow the railway track for a time, then at a certain point there's a sign for 'Ella Rock' and your map may agree - don't take this way. It's much longer and way easier to go downhill than up. Instead, just carry on a little while longer along the track, then there's some faded blue paint on a rock to the left - go down here instead. Then you just follow the path along and up and eventually you'll get there. I'd recommend going back the first way when you leave though, it is a bit more of an obscure path, but it's pretty and you go past a nice waterfall. To go that way, you just turn off right when you reach the little hut with the very expensive water and snacks again, instead of going straight, down the way you came. The actual view from Ella Rock is nice, over the mountains and everything. ...I'm not gunna lie, it didn't completely blow my mind, (I was pretty mad about the climb... and we forgot snacks) but it was really nice, I'm just being a Grinch.

As there was a very good description how to get there in the travel guide of Stefan Loose we felt safe to do it without guide. The start was very easy to find and we hiked along the railways as described. After a black bridge on the railways from which you can see the waterfalls, a group of local people stood around and sent us left. We were kind of confused as the travel guide only mentions to go left after mile 166.5 (train signals) but followed the local advice. The path looks similar to the further description in our travel guide but we ended up nowhere in a tea plantation where out of a sudden a friendly tea lady offered her help to find the way. We followed her through pathes you can’t really call so - nothing tourists would ever find - and as she also seemed to lead us back and forth, sometimes stopping to get more money, we really felt ripped off after a time. Fortunately we saw a group of tourists on the other site of a tea plantation we crossed with her and so could left the tea lady (who still insist her way would be the right one) and found the main trail again. When coming down the whole correct track, we saw that the locals just sent us left about 600m to early and met other tourists who had the same experience. We crossed those locals on the way back and asked them what the intention was. They just said „there are two ways“...and when we told another arriving tourist group to not follow their instructions but go 600 m further to meet the main track they got really angry. We anyway told everyone we met on the way back to not go the wrong way - so I guess their business was over at least for today.

We left at around 4:15 and caught sunrise but would leave about 3:45 next time just so you can enjoy the walk and get there in plenty of time. So some locals have left misleading signs and directions so you get lost and have to be guided but we were given some great instructions by our Homestay host. You really don’t need a guide just stick to the directions. I’ve attached an image of a map given to us which was pretty accurate. Walk along the track (Kandy direction) stay on the track until you pass Kithul Ella station (I think it’s called). Once you are between the rail markers 166 1/2 and 166 1/4 you turn off the track to your left almost back on yourself. Walk down this track approx 100m then you’ll cross a bridge over a small stream/waterfall and you’ll come to a tea plantation. Take the left fork and continue along this path. Keep going and don’t stop. There will be lots of turnings off but you just have to stay on track. Eventually you’ll get to the end of the tea plantation and come to an abundance of eucalyptus trees. The paths then split. We took the left track which gets daily steep and difficult at times especially the last 20/30 Minutes we were pretty out of breath but it’s a direct route to the top. To be honest as soon as you reach the eucalyptus trees I think you can take any route up as long as you’re on a path that’s heading up. We came down via a different route which joined up with our initial path amongst the trees which was an easier descent. The whole trip from the Village Biew Homestay was 7 miles and on the way up took us 1 hour and 18 Minutes. We were racing to get up there for the sunrise though. Worth it.
