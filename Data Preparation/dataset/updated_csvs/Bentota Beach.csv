Bentota is one of those rare places in Sri Lanka where you can completely slow down, but still have plenty to see and do if you want more than just beach time. Most mornings started at Bentota Beach, enjoying the sun, sea, and long stretches of golden sand. Even during peakù busy days, the beach never felt crowded, and the calm atmosphere made it perfect for long walks, swimming, or simply doing nothing at all. One of the highlights of my stay was exploring the Bentota River and mangrove lagoon. The river safari was peaceful and scenic, and stopping for a fish spa along the way was a surprisingly relaxing experience. For a bit more excitement, I also tried water sports, which are well organised and suitable for both beginners and more adventurous travellers. Bentota is also rich in nature and culture. I visited the Turtle Sanctuary, which was both educational and heart-warming, especially seeing the conservation work being done. A visit to a low-country tea estate gave me a new appreciation for Sri Lankan tea, while exploring the moonstone mines was fascinating and something quite unique to this region. Architecture and spirituality are also part of Bentota’s charm. Walking through Geoffrey Bawa’s botanical gardens was a real highlight — beautifully designed and very peaceful. I also visited the Kande Vihara ancient temple, which has an impressive presence and offers a calm, reflective atmosphere. I spent a few days exploring nearby areas too. Cinnamon Island (Mirala Duwa) was a must-visit, where locals demonstrated how real Ceylon cinnamon is grown and processed. Early mornings at Beruwala Fishing Harbour gave a glimpse into local life, and a short visit to the Beruwala Lighthouse offered lovely views of the coastline. One memorable outing was a boat ride to Troll Rock during low tide, which felt like discovering a hidden spot. Other experiences included visiting spice gardens, learning about the essential properties of Sri Lankan spices, and watching locals create traditional woodwork and handcrafted masks, which really shows the depth of local craftsmanship. For nature lovers, the hike up Pahuru Kanda (Little Adam’s Peak) was rewarding, and cooling off afterward at Polgampola Waterfall and its natural pool was the perfect way to end the day. Food was a big part of my experience in Bentota, and one place stood out throughout my stay — Esprit Seafood Restaurant and Bar. Despite the name, the menu is very diverse, making it suitable for everyone. Alongside excellent seafood, they also serve well-prepared steaks, chicken dishes, vegetarian options, and meals catering to different dietary needs. The restaurant is set in a peaceful location, and many evenings were made even better with live music such as saxophone or acoustic guitar, creating a relaxed and welcoming atmosphere. It’s easy to understand why Esprit has earned a TripAdvisor Travellers’ Choice Award — the consistency in food quality, service, and ambiance really shows. After spending nearly a month in Bentota, what stood out most was the balance it offers — beach, adventure, culture, nature, and great food, all without feeling rushed or overcrowded. It’s a destination that suits couples, families, and long-stay travellers alike. I left feeling refreshed and already looking forward to returning.","December 26, 2025",0.0,0.0

Known locally as Handirangala, this unique rock formation has captivated locals and travelers alike with its striking resemblance to a sleeping giant. Rising above the tranquil waters of the Indian Ocean, Handirangala is more than just a geological wonder; it is a testament to the fusion of nature’s artistry and the rich folklore of Sri Lanka. The Legend of Handirangala According to local lore, Handirangala, or “The Troll Rock,” is the petrified remains of a mythical giant. The story recounts how this giant once roamed the island with unmatched strength and a deep connection to nature. However, driven by hubris or love for the ocean, he defied the gods and was cursed to eternal slumber. Over centuries, the waves and wind sculpted his body into the rocky outcrop visible today, where he rests as a silent guardian of the shore. Some say that during certain times of the day, when the sunlight hits the rock just right, the giant’s features—his forehead, nose, and chin—become unmistakably clear, evoking awe and wonder. The Geological Marvel Beyond the myth, Handirangala is a fascinating geological formation. Composed of ancient rock, likely shaped by volcanic activity and centuries of coastal erosion, it serves as a reminder of the Earth’s evolving landscape. The rock’s contours mimic the form of a reclining figure, with its “head” pointing toward the sky and its “body” merging seamlessly into the ocean. This natural phenomenon highlights the interplay between geology and human imagination, as people have long found stories within the patterns of the earth. The Mystique from the Beach From the soft, golden sands of Bentota Beach, the silhouette of Handirangala is unmistakable. The tranquility of the setting adds to the mystique of the rock, as the ocean waves lap gently against its base, echoing the whispers of ancient tales. Visitors often find themselves lost in thought, marveling at how nature can evoke such humanlike forms. For photographers and nature enthusiasts, the rock provides a perfect subject, particularly during sunrise and sunset, when the interplay of light and shadow accentuates its shape. A Symbol of Cultural and Natural Heritage Handirangala is not just a visual spectacle but a cultural symbol. The rock embodies the deep-rooted relationship between Sri Lankans and their environment, where myths breathe life into natural landmarks. It also serves as a reminder of the need to preserve such sites for future generations. The allure of Handirangala attracts visitors from all over the world, making it an integral part of Bentota’s charm and a must-visit destination for those exploring Sri Lanka. Conclusion Handirangala, the mythical Troll Rock of Bentota Beach, is a place where legend and nature converge. Its mysterious allure and breathtaking presence inspire imagination and reverence, offering a glimpse into the profound ways humanity connects with its surroundings. Whether as a geological wonder, a cultural landmark, or a mythological relic, this sleeping giant continues to watch over the shimmering waters of the Indian Ocean, inviting all who visit to dream, explore, and believe in the magic of the natural world.","December 18, 2024",0.0,0.0

This view, according to architect Channa Daswatte makes this property the one that links the land and the sea. The ‘new’ Bentota Beach is not merely a recreation or a restoration. The main building of the old hotel has been reconstructed newly, as it was built by Bawa. This showcases Bawa’s wide  architectural influences ranging from Bali to ancient Sri Lankan monuments. Inside the hotel has the signature of Geoffrey Bawa and the period it was constructed in, but in a modern and functional representation. The lead architect Channa Daswatte has done an amazing job, not only to archive an iconic construction but also through his brilliance, make it a fresh, modern and functional. It is a museum and treasure trove of art and architecture, that concurrently delivers a guests expectections from a modern luxury hotel.","July 27, 2020",0.0,0.0

Another day another fun in Bentota After spending the arrival day on sea beach and swimming pool of Ekho Surf resort , this day was to explore Bentota.  A visit to sea turtle hatchery was an eye opener to know that sea turtles are endangered species and now this twin has projects to save the species. We could see and hold some turtles in the hatchery and I was sad to know that some turtles here were limbless due to accidents by motors of the ships used for tourist fun.  On one side we are trying to save the species on other we are making their lives handicapped. I am reminded of a song “ मैं हँसूँ या मैं रोऊँ “. Talking about Hindi film songs , our next venture was also a reminder of another wonderful song “ ओहरे ताल मिले नदी के जल , नदी मिले सागर में , ओ मितवा रे , सागर मिले कौन से जल में , कोई जाने ना”.   We actually saw Maduganga river merging in Indian Ocean and it was a unique experience. Let’s read a little google knowledge about the place before I narrate further Bentota is a resort town on Sri Lanka’s southwest coast. Its long Bentota Beach stretches north, where it becomes a sandy strip known as Paradise Island, parallel to Bentota Lagoon. Coral-rich dive sites include Canoe Rock. On Bentota River, centuries-old Galapota Temple has a large Buddha statue. Together with the smaller Randombe Lake, to which Bentota lake is connected by two narrow channels, it forms the Madu Ganga wetland. Its estuary and the many mangrove islets on it constitute a complex coastal wetland ecosystem. In has high ecological, biological and aesthetic significance, being home to approximately 303 species of plants belonging to 95 families and to 248 species of vertebrate animals. The inhabitants of its islets produce peeled cinnamon and cinnamon oil. The Maduganga Wetland was declared in 2003, in terms of the Ramsar Convention. The Budha statue , the temple in the river and people making their livelihood through Cinnamon oil production in various island of a total of sixty two islands in the river made us happy and the sadness of turtle accidents reduced it a bit.  Spotting monitor lizard , few white and black birds ( photos attached) and purple faced monkeys brought wider smiles on everyone’s face. Fish foot massage was another activity if the day. The experts say the health risks, both to humans and to the fish, outweigh any potential benefits. As a result, the fish pedicures have been banned in 10 U.S. states, Mexico and parts of Europe.Jul 18, 2018. There are eight ugly sides of this beauty treatment ( one can google and become wise ) .  We , however got it done as we lacked google wisdom at that time and to be honest , I did not enjoy it at all. The day ended on a visit to another place where moon stones are extracted along with pockets of tourists and a visit to a mask factory.  Tomorrow the penultimate day of our tour may have some more moments of happiness, I am certain about that. If last days highlight was “Devi “- the pleasing most personality, we came across the tour , today belonged to “ Shan”.  He is a young man , who controlled our journey in MaduGanga as captain of the boat declared the eldest member of the party ( me) the young man of the group and his wife ( Prabha) as group leader by virtue of her leadership qualities as observed by him .  Jiyo “ Shan”- you made our day. Enjoy some glimpses of the day. Rakesh Bharti","September 16, 2019",0.0,0.0

Whilst the hotel was nice we felt very uneasy walking around outside the hotel. The ‘beach boys’ preyed on us and we got approached on both the beachside and the other road and train side of the hotel. The boys (who where actually older men probably in their 50’s/60’s in our experience) literally wait for you to step out of the hotel and approach you as soon as you leave the safety of the hotel. At first they seem friendly and want to chat but it then becomes apparent that they are not genuine and they are not to be trusted - on two occasions we wanted to go to the town and local market and on both occasions we got approached and both men (who at first seemed friendly and nice) took us the opposite direction (we realised afterwards) and luckily we trusted our instincts to stop and return to the hotel - we don’t know where they where planning to take us and what their intentions where.... We like to get out and explore where we are staying (we’re keen travellers) but we didn’t feel comfortable doing so in this area because of the men loitering around outside of the hotel.  Although we will return to Sri Lanka in the future we will not return to Bentota.,"August 29, 2019",0.0,0.0

November December and January are peak season in Sri lanka. In the sri lanka vacation on 3rd day we went to bentota from Kandy. It is a beach destination in West coast of Sri Lanka. There we took bentota river boat ride. The boat has gone through mangrove forest. There are lot of water sports agent. You can easily book it. The cost of boat ride 10 USD per person. It was 40 minutes boat journey. There are lot of sports activity like speed boat riding, jet ski etc. We spent that night in bentota hotel. Bentota beach is very silent and clear and beautiful, but for taking sea bath it is quite risky. If tourist want beautiful but silence beach destination, then Bentota is the best option. Next day I took another boat ride. That is Madhu Ganga boat ride. The cost was 10 USD per person. This is 2 hr boat journey. After boat ride we moved to Galle. There we have seen light house, some old architecture. We came back in bentota hotel. Bentota to Galle distance is 75km. It will takes 2 hr.

There is a rock between the bay and the sea, it's about 900 meters from the beach, so it's a great swim.  When the sea is calm, you can swim very near the rock and see all kinds of fish (not much of coral reef, though, and whatever there is is dead).  When the sea is not so calm, be very careful – I stayed at least 10–20 meters away from the nearest visible rock, and I could still see some rocks beneath me. The downsides: 1) The sea is very opaque (cloudy) – you can't see further than 1 meter, perhaps a little more.  This is because of the very fine sand floating in the sea (near the beach) and, above all, because of microscopic algae making the water green.  2) On the way from the beach to the rock, there is an area where somewhat dirty-looking foam gathers – you might want to swim around it.  3) Of course, as transpires from the above, if you like beach partying, this is not a beach for you.  4) The waves can be strong, so I am not sure it's a good beach for small kids.","February 16, 2019",0.0,0.0

We could pay what we wanted based on the tour experience. The trip was a disaster, run by two young teenagers. When we came back, the managers put a hard pressure on us to pay 100 US$ - or 17000 slr. I got angry and payed 5000 slr. My advice: Stay away from these swindlers!","November 18, 2018",0.0,0.0

It’s £95 at home for 2 hours in the actual sea going around seeing caves and beautiful islands like Herm and Sark. I’m totally upset that we have been left here for 7 days and have another 4 to go! If anyone has any idea where we can swim on a clean decent part of the beach please let me know but I didn’t pay for a month in Sri Lanka to sit around permanently, eating and being ripped off to look at nature, which should be free anyway! Not impressed with any of this place so far. It’s completely over rated. My teenagers spent most of the time on his phone and that’s when we can even get reliable WiFi which is meant to be included everywhere you go! Really disappointing holiday all round. Don’t come to Sri Lanka for more than 7-10 days and don’t spend more than 2 nights in any place. It’s the same thing in every place you go apart from Nuwara Eliyah which is very green and cold.

The hotel was great, a lot of the staff are very friendly and accommodating. I feel the hotel could provide a little more information about things to do and places to visit, and how to avoid local scams. I would AVOID booking trips from the beach boys. We met Lucky (beach boy)who was very friendly but was selling overly inflated trips...be-aware!! Also there were 2 local men who showed several of us how to get to shops/restaurants... he took us down a path and over a lake and then told we had to pay thousands of rupees to return. I met an older couple in the hotel taken in by the same scam one evening and they were frightened and paid 5000 rupees. The hotel also do not provide sunbeds on the beach.","March 26, 2018",0.0,0.0
