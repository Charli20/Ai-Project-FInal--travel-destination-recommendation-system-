After that, all you see is fog. In about 3 hours you can comfortably walk along the main path in the park to the World ́s End and Baker ́s Falls. If you are lucky you will experience the bloom of the Nelu (as happened in November 2025), but this only happens every 10 years.  The only annual shrub then dies. For the journey I had a private driver, which is easiest. Or you can organize it through your hotel. Getting there by public transport is rather difficult and time-consuming.","December 17, 2025",0.0,0.0

If you're looking for a break from the heat and beaches, this is a fantastic escape into cool, fresh mountain air. We started the 9.5 km loop trail just after sunrise. The park opens at 6:00 AM, and I highly recommend getting there early. Not only do you beat the crowds, but you also have a better chance of catching clear skies before the mist rolls in over World’s End  the highlight of the hike. The trail is mostly flat with a few rocky or muddy sections. It takes about 2.5 to 3 hours depending on your pace and how often you stop to admire the scenery. Along the way, you’ll pass through rolling plains, dense forest, and misty stretches that feel almost otherworldly. Wildlife is shy but present we saw sambars (large deer), plenty of birds, and lots of interesting plants. When you reach World’s End, the view is jaw-dropping  a sheer cliff dropping almost 800 meters, with tea estates and distant hills stretching into the horizon. Mini World’s End comes a bit earlier on the trail and offers a similar, though less dramatic, viewpoint. After that, Baker’s Falls is a lovely place to stop, rest, and enjoy the sound of rushing water. Horton Plains isn’t about adrenaline  it’s about quiet, natural beauty. It’s not crowded (especially early), and the air is cool and refreshing. You feel totally immersed in nature.","October 13, 2025",0.0,0.0

The views from World’s End and Mini World’s End were absolutely stunning, especially before the clouds rolled in. Bakers Falls was also beautiful and worth the small detour. We spotted some sambar deer along the way, and the landscape is incredibly unique, a mix of grassland and cloud forest that you don’t see often. The weather was cool and refreshing, which made the walk even more enjoyable. Do bring water, a light jacket, and good walking shoes.

You can drive to the starting point, where you’ll find parking, and from there, you’ll need to walk. There are a few shops for snacks and clean washrooms at the starting point.

While it is a beautiful place for a challenging hike, my poor review is because of the entry fees. Foreigners are charged around 40usd, which is about an exorbitant 150 times more than a local ticket. The 25usd price is misleading, because you also need to pay government taxes and service charges.

The highlight of the area is the 'World's End' - a spectacular viewpoint with breathtaking vistas. However, travelers should note that reaching this spot is quite a challenge. The path to World's End is not just a leisurely stroll; it involves navigating steep, uneven terrain with multiple climbs. It's essential to wear comfortable, sturdy shoes to tackle these paths. This trek might not be suitable for those with physical limitations, knee injuries, or families traveling with small children due to its demanding nature. Moreover, it's crucial to consider the weather before planning your visit. The rainy season can be particularly hazardous in this region, with risks of sudden floods. Therefore, it’s best to avoid monsoon periods for a safer and more enjoyable experience. In summary, Horton Plains offers a stunning natural escape for the active and adventurous traveler, but it requires good preparation and a consideration of physical abilities. It's a place that leaves you in awe of nature's beauty, but also reminds you of its demands","January 23, 2024",0.0,0.0

Overall, I would recommend choosing antoher of the many attractions in the hill country over Horton Plains. Why go: it's a pretty and clean walk through a high-altitute plateau to a wide outlook down to the plains. We saw some deer in the open fields and interesting descriptions of the cloud forest. The walk is comparable in enjoyment to many temperate walks elsewhere. Easy to hire a return car trip from Nuwara Eliya (10,000 LKR). You can easily do the circular walk in 2-3hrw. Take sturdy shoes and a warm top layer. Start early: be at the park centre for 6:30am to get the best chance of the views before the clouds come in. If money is no question, then you will enjoy the park. Why skip: regretfully the park management seem to have taken to an extortion racket. A single person ticket for a foreigner will cost you around USD40 with the ticket price and the 'service charge', and even more if you actually want to pay in dollars (the clerk at the entrance will happily exchange to rupees for a hefty fee). That's probably about 40 times the price for locals.

(Pheww) Undoubtedly this hike will give you a beautiful experience of walking in sweat, clouds, mist, rain and breeze ! One can experience all of them in the total hike !

There are levels of walking and they are easy, difficult and more difficult!! And there are definitely the same the way they are listed. In the rains the rocks, the waking passage can be slippery making your hike really challenging. Till you reach bakers fall you will get an insight of your journey anyways !! One should be with very good quality hiking shoes with good grip which will be helpful while waking. Rain Coats, cap and some food stuffs are very important along with you. Remember to carry them in a paper bag as no plastics are allowed inside. They will remove the plastic covering of the water bottle too ( a good initiative though) Do try to start your journey maximum by 7:30 am to see a clear view near the world end ( if you fortunate). Else the clouds will cover you well and give another experience for photography only 🙃 You will enjoy the named places called and mini worlds end and worlds end. They are the places where you can have a breathtaking views if there are no clouds. Be very careful of the steep elevation of the worlds end while doing some photography. This may take a minimum of 3 to 4 hours depending on the walking speed and time. Apart from this: undoubtedly this will give an amazing feeling once you finally see the finish gate 😎 # leaving your foot prints behind 🙂 # mythological: In the story, Hanuman set fire to Horton plains and that fire lasted for a long time. The original name, Maha Eliya Thenna carries the meaning, 'The hugely lighten ground'. Even now the upper layer of soil can be seem in a blackish grey colour.

It simply took my breath away -- I compared the experience to Haleakula and this wins.  After the sunrise we then proceeded into the park.  We elected the clockwise path which is a bit shorter distance to the World's End which improves your chances of getting the view before the fogs set in.  Although it did seem that even when there was fog, it was like weather at home:  just wait a few minutes and it changes.  The last 1/3 of the trail TO the World's End was so dense with shrubbery that without our guide I'm not sure we would have thought we were on the right path.  For the number of people that take this experience, we thought it would have been more trodden, but it seems Mother Nature tries to keep it fairly dense.  After viewing W/E, the remainder of the trail is a really nice nature walk.  Keep your eyes out for green lizards that sit on top of the trees, little brown frogs that are fun to watch puff up with their croaking, and the variety of birds that inhabit the area.

What can I say, it was definitely worth waking up so early. We saw plenty of deers eating fresh grass even before we entered the main gate of the park, and then had an enjoyable walk along the route towards Baker's Falls. There are two options: you can start with the Falls and finish by the Little World's End or vice versa. We chose the first option and did not regret it. After we saw the sunrise, the sun quickly disappeared behind the clouds and we did not see it much until we reached the falls and the skies became blue. We took wonderful photos and had our packed breakfast right there on a bench, which was so romantic and enjoyable. When we continued our route towards the World's End, we realized how right we were in taking that path - we almost always hiked down rather than climbing up and it made our trekking way more comfortable and less tiring. The day before we hiked the Adam's Peak, so we could not feel our legs and feet after that and this path we chose turned out to be helpful :) Unfortunately, when we reached the World's End, a big cloud hung on top and covered all the view. We waited for 30 minutes and the situation remained the same. We still were pleased with the hike and the World's End because there was a certain mystery in this endless mist over the edge. You can literally feel you are on the edge of nowhere. P.S. In my opinion, you won't need a guide to hike Horton Plains. It is super easy and it is impossible to get lost on the way. There is literally only one path and it is a round journey, so whatever way you choose - you will end up in the same place. Only if a lady is solo and scared of being attacked or something??? But generally, for me it seemed peaceful and safe. And if a leopard comes out from a bush, I don't think that having a guide will be helpful right??))) Also the time you will spend there will be at least 4-5 hrs if you do not want to run along the whole route and wish to take nice pictures and just enjoy the nature around you. So don't listen to people who tell it is like a 3-hour hike. Maybe, if you don't complete the whole circle..)","January 23, 2022",0.0,0.0

Started off around 1.30 pm and took the anti-clock wise trail, which is to go to the Chimney Lake first followed up by Baker's falls and then the World's end. I think this way is better than going clockwise as it is easier to go downhill on the bumpy road near Baker's hills than to climb it. Would not recommend to people who are over 60 if not in good health conditions as it could be really tiring and there's no emergency aid available. The attraction can be improved by adding a tempered glass deck, it would attract more adrenaline junkies. Also, there are no places to buy food nearby which is a great limitation.

Baker’s Waterfalls We were so lucky to be able to see a wild Sambar Deer right in front of us up close before the starting point of the trek. Entrance fee is quite steep at LKR3,850 per person. Suggest to go early in the morning as we departed from our hotel at Nuwara Eliya at 5am. On the way up to Horton Plains, before reaching the ticket booth, we stopped at the roadside to watch the sunrise above the sea clouds. Horton Plains is a UNESCO World Heritage Site where is protected areas for its nature beauty. It is a plateau at 2100-2300 meters above sea level. Hence, be prepared for the warm clothing since it can be very chilly early in the morning. A complete route of hiking require at least half day time (4-5 hours depends on individual fitness level) and the trekking path is relatively easy for all age, but good walking shoes are necessary, plus adequate drinking water. Packing breakfast is advisable for people who do morning trek. Tight security check of the bag/ haversack at the entrance of trekking and no plastics allowed at the park. We were so glad that we did morning trek as the weather was cool and pleasant and completed our trek slightly before noon. Hence, most people do morning trek and be there early as there will be long queue for security check. An afternoon trekking would be warm and sweaty due to warmer weather in the day.

We like to visit. I am also expecting the long walk, but never did I realise that the 9.5km walk is really not simple, at least for me. The path initially was easy, as it is flat, but once entered the grassland, the path was rough with obstacles along the way. Ups & downs, under shade of the trees. Open space grassland path is easier to walk but under hot sun. We did not see any animals at all. However when reaching the mini world and hike another 1 km to the World End and further 2km Baker's Fall is really a reward. Another few km to the exit, for unfit people like me must reconsider. The path is a loop. I would say it is good for those who like hiking. Entrance fee is not cheap too. LKR7, 670 for 2 foreigners, 1 local, parking, tax.","February 12, 2020",0.0,0.0

We arrived around 06.50 and we certainly were not some of the first here. Despite what some people say, this is a pretty tough walk. I'm relatively fit but I'd still call it a challenging walk. My Fitbit recorded 17500 steps and 171 floors. I hate to tarnish an entire country but we were again inflicted to Chinese tourist hooligans. These moronic individuals who are only interested in taking posed selfies of themselves with 'V' fingers need to be taught how to be a tourist and respect others. We had seen it at religious sites where they run everywhere, shouting and pushing and completely disrespecting other people's religion. Today it was the utter disrespect of nature. Signs ask to be quiet, this is a place to take in the landscape, to listen to the wind. This is not a place to have Timberlake coming out of your I Phone at full blast As no one else was saying anything I'm afraid some Anglo Saxon words about their parentage was uttered and I guess they understood as they put their earphones on!!!! We were lucky to see the very rare bear monkey, an animal that is incredibly shy. Everyone around was hushed and we were able to see this amazing animal. Despite sushhhing and pointing to the monkey so they too could see it, these imbecilic people started to whistle at it like you would a dog. The monkey disappeared. At Worlds End again it was the Chinese that pushed to get the best vantage point to get selfies of themselves. China has just started tourism and this problem will only grow. Everyone appears aware of it but no one is teaching them that there are ways to be a respectable tourist. Our guide said this happens all the time. Perhaps responsible tourism behavior needs to be taught in school? The walk as mentioned is challenging, some good walking shoes should prevent slips. We saw people in flip flops. We also saw tourists with small children. This is not the place to take children. It is challenging enough on some of the steeper climbs, but looking after or carrying a child is an accident waiting to happen. It will be completely boring for them anyway and a pain for the parent. The drive from Nuwara is in the dark and  therefore you don't see much, but coming back its a great drive and you see plenty of local life with good photo opportunities.","January 24, 2020",0.0,0.0

The open air toilets were a great design and odour free. I hope the money spent goes to a good cause. In the UK national parks are free and most other countries that I've visited they only charge a nominal entrance fee. Sri Lanka could get a bad reputation for ripping off tourists. We've regularly come across one price for locals and a much larger one for foreigners. The recent implementation of free tourist visas for stays of less than one month is a great way of encouraging tourists to return after the Easter bombings. We came for two months and had to pay £160, we've spent a lot of money in that time. We'd consider returning but please reduce the visa fees.","January 24, 2020",0.0,0.0

It's a hugely popular hike but in truth is rather unremarkable. The trail meanders through rather mundane scenery to the lookout point which offers pretty impressive views. Having said that, I wasn't entirely blown away by them. There are, for example, plenty of vistas in Scotland that are equally if not more impressive. The high numbers of visitors mean there isn't a great deal of wildlife to be seen. There were sambar deer hanging around near the car park, which I believe there often are, and we were lucky enough to spot a purple-faced leaf monkey while driving back to Nuwara Eliya. But don't expect too much. Leopard sightings around here are almost unheard of. All in all it was actually a pleasant enough hike. But the trouble is that it costs way too much for what it is. Entry fees for the two of us came to around 8,000 rupees (£35, $44, €40) which is just crazy. You'll also have to pay transport costs on top of that - for example we paid 3,000 rupees (£13, $17, €15) for a tuk tuk from Nuwara Eliya. And it simply isn't worth the money for what it is.","October 3, 2019",0.0,0.0

It sits at a height of more than 2000 meters above sea level. This plateau spreads over 3150 hectares, and is a great attraction to both local and foreign tourists. It can be reached by motorable road from Pattipola or Ohiya. When you climb from below you can see how vegetation differs and weather becomes colder. When you enter the plateau you see it’s covered with mist and stunted trees due to the strong winds on the plains. Also you can find small ponds of water with water lilies. As you go further the trees become fewer but instead there are low growing bushes and more of a moor type of vegetation. Main attraction in Hortan plains is ‘Worlds End, a 700 meter breathtaking sheer drop. This drop has the most magnificent view of the sourthern wall of central highlands. Another attraction is Baker’s falls. It can be reached after a long walk through the forest. The plains are home for leopards,elk, monkeys and jackals. Plain is also home for many endemic plants. When you make a visit please make sure you do not harm the plants and animals and you will only observe the beauty of it. Worth making a trip.","October 2, 2019",0.0,0.0

We hired a car and driver for LRK10,000.  The Horton Plains NP fee for two people, plus the car and driver was LKR8,100.  Apart from the first kilometre or so there is no sign of the money raised from foreign tourists being used to maintain the route.  In places the path would become a watercourse after rain, luckily it was dry when we were there.

Fortunately, the heavy rain dropped the night before our 9.5 km trek through the park, which took in the spectacular World's End. It made some uneven parts of the trail a bit slippery, so solid hiking shoes or, at minimum runners, are essential. Only a moderate level of fitness is required to navigate the main trail, which takes in World's End and Bakers Falls. However, anyone with some walking or climbing disability should take note that there are those uneven areas to negotiate. World's End is so called because of its 900 metre vertical cliff face that drops into the forest of the valley wall. It's hard to capture its scale in photographs. There are two viewing decks at World's End. Beware, particularly for children, that there are few barriers to prevent falls over the cliffs, both on the decks and on the short trail between decks. My impression was that the coiled razor wire would merely lacerate you during the fall rather than prevent it. The higher deck gives a much better view of the main cliff face. The steps down to Bakers Falls are also quite steep. Hortons Plains features a wide variety of landscape and an explosion of different colours from the many plant species that adorn the plain. The area is also a good place to see Sambar Deer, one of Sri Lanka's larger deer species.","July 23, 2019",0.0,0.0

We got there early a) to beat the crowds, and b) because I had an afternoon train to Ella to catch, but we actually got there so early that the ticket office hadn't opened yet. The hike isn't too difficult, it's about 8 miles with a few portions of steeper climbing, but getting there in the morning allows you to see some GORGEOUS views. My driver gave me the tip of sitting and waiting at World's End because a lot can change in the scenery in a matter of minutes, and it was the best advice. I ate snacks I packed (remember to do this) and took a 40 minute rest up there and watched in awe as clouds and fog came in and out (at one point completely blocking the view and then clearing up to reveal a gorgeous drop and the plains beyond). I wanted to take pictures every time I turned the corner because I was treated to new views every mile or so - the diversity in ecosystems and flora/fauna is INSANE. If you're in Nuwara Eliya, make sure you make time for this hike! I actually stopped in Nuwara Eliya JUST so I could get out here! Definitely get an early start (apparently sometimes in the morning you can see deer and elephants if it's early enough!) so you're hiking when it's cooler and to beat the crowds.","July 23, 2019",0.0,0.0

We visited on the morning of Friday 12th July. Apologies for the long and less than positive review, I am also posting this hoping someone may be able to point me towards a way to lodge a complaint with the Park itself as I haven’t been able to find this online. Ticket prices are not advertised as prices tend to fluctuate so there is no price list at the ticket booth. We asked for “3 tickets, one person is local”, however this was interpreted as 3 tickets plus one local. A foreigner ticket at the time was ~2,650 rupees. With no price list, visitors the transaction is based purely on verbal communication with no calculator or screen to show how prices are calculated (there are three taxes on top of the ticket price). Understandably this is also a quick, rushed process during busy times such as when we visited. Unfortunately, we were unable to realise we were overcharged until we had driven 10 minutes from the ticket office to the park entrance. At the park entrance we spoke with a number of staff and based on what they advised we decided to enter the park rather than drive back and seek a refund (lucky we did this because as we found out, we would not have been refunded anyway and it would have ruined our visit). On our way out we approached the ticket booth and fortunately the same cashier was working (a middle aged man, moustache, larger, has worked at the park for over 15 years). We were very careful to politely inform that we were accidentally overcharged (e.g. we avoided saying “you overcharged us”, instead saying “we were accidentally overcharged”) however he immediately went on the defensive, became very rude and irrational and refused to help us. He accused us of being irresponsible and not communicating with him properly. He also said there is no possibility of a refund once a sale has been made and its the customers responsibility to know what they are being charged and that he does not make mistakes so it must be our fault. When we tried to explain that we were not trying to pass blame and a simple misunderstanding had occurred, he became argumentative and started insulting our tour guide/driver in Sinhalese and saying he was not looking after us properly. He refused to call the park manager (he said there was no phone reception, although all three of us had reception) and said nobody would help us because it was our fault. There was lots of back and forth about ticket prices not being advertised, no way of knowing what we have been charged for until transaction has been finalised etc. until we finally decided that nothing we did or said would help us obtain a refund. Overall, this left a very sour taste in our mouths and our tour guide/driver felt ashamed that a park ranger would behave in this way. Unfortunately, the cashier did not have an ounce of empathy and his behaviour screamed dishonesty and not a care on the world for doing what is right. Had he at least even tried to help us in the slightest, our experience with him would have been completely difference. Lesson: when buying tickets and you have a local guide to accompany you, be very clear to say X foreigner tickets and Y local ticket. Avoid assuming any statements like “3 people, one is local” as this will be interpreted as 3 foreigners, one local”. As for the park itself, it is beautiful and the views are amazing. It was lovely walking through such stunning scenery. However, the price is quite high especially in comparison to similar yet free experiences we have had in Sri Lanka as well as other national parks we have visited around the world.","July 18, 2019",0.0,0.0

Prices - Adults just under 3000 LKR and half the price for young children. That roughly equates to £12 per adult. You can see the breakdown in the photo. The hike was a gentle walk for half of the way. The last part, to get to World’s End and Baker’s Fall was trickier but still manageable. The whole hike was breathtaking. It took us 2 1/2 hrs for the whole hike (some say between 3-4 hrs). It’s is clearly signed and there really is no need to have a guide. At one point you can choose to go left or right. Going left means that you will visit World’s end first and right will take you to Baker’s Fall first. It’s a loop so it doesn’t matter which way you choose. Many people have shared that you are not allowed to take any plastic with you, however the rangers do help you with this. We went there with water bottles, as we had nothing else to carry the water, and some snacks. When we got there they removed the plastic labels off the water bottles and then provided paper bags for our snacks. We were very impressed with the care and attention towards the conservation of flora and fauna and they should be applauded for it. We didn’t see a piece of rubbish and it was completely unspoiled.

Unfortunately our hotel delayed us significantly as they forgot our packed breakfast which meant we ended up missing out on the views. Had we got there 10 mins earlier we would have seen what we headed to Nuwara Eliya for. While we missed the views, the hiking was still pleasant with nice scenery around and the waterfall made for a diverting stop. The round trip from the car park to the view point and then the waterfall is just shy of 10km. We found it an easy walk and most people should be able to do it easily.  There is a fair bit of wildlife to appreciate: birds, lizards and frogs. We came across an organised birding group so I imagine its a good place to see birds. In order to have the best chance of seeing the views and the end of Sri Lanka try to get to the viewpoint before 8am as it clouds over really quickly. There definitely seems to be no point doing the walk mid/late morning or the afternoon as the whole place will be covered in cloud.","May 14, 2019",0.0,0.0

The landscape was very similar to Kosciusko in NSW Australia especially the low bushes. It did not have that many flowers nor birds to look at except rhododendrons. - The walk was not too arduous but if you do have walking poles would suggest to use at least one to provide support & security as certain parts of the track were steep and narrow. We (over 60 & 70 yo respectively) managed to do it under 3.5 hours without walking poles. - Arrived at 8am as per the guide's recommendation and the car park was full. When arrived it was a bit cool but certainly not cold (for Kiwis & Aussies) and getting warmer later on. - Make sure the seal and label on plastic water bottles and any plastic wraps etc. removed before the walk as it would be inspected and removed  by park rangers at the park entrance. - Barkers' fall was nothing special but the views from the World's End & Little World's End were spectacular.

It is quite an expensive place to visit, although the same as many other national parks in Sri Lanka  - $15USD per person, $8USD service charge, plus the vehicle and driver entrance 185Rs plus 15% tax on top of all of that! The tuk tuk ride from Nuwara Eliya was 3500Rs. There was a long line for the toilets at the entrance but there are more toilets inside the park where the walk starts from. It’s quite a long drive from the park entrance to start of the walk, I had assumed the walk would start at the entrance but we saw no one walking along the road. We saw several Sambar Deer though! There are bag checks at the start of the walk where plastic is confiscated. Plastic drink bottles had the plastic labels torn off them. If you have food in plastic bags you’ll be given a paper bag instead. This is great to see and it really meant that the park was very clean. The walk clockwise to World’s End is pleasant with grasslands and bush. There are toilets near little worlds end. It was misty at World’s End but the mist came and went so we were still able to see out to some lakes south at times. It’s a neat spot for watching clouds of mist rise over the 800m drop. The rest of the loop walk was nice too as it’s through the grasslands with views down to a river. There are more toilets near the waterfall.

The general advise is to get there early morning as the views at worlds end clouds over after 10 a.m. It’s a 9 km walk in a circular route, where you have the choice to go left or right at the first junction. Going left you reach worlds end first, as opposed Bakers fall by going right. I took the left to get to worlds end early and was rewarded by only having a few people there. The views are good with a vertical drop of over 800 metres. After 20 mins lots more tourists arrived so I moved on. Luckily when reaching Bakers falls later again there were very few people. The rest of the walk is nice but nothing spectacular and took around 2 hours in total. I didn’t see much in terms of wildlife but there are deer and even Leopards supposedly.

I wouldn't want to do it in the middle of the day as I thought it was quite hot when we walked - from about 7.20 to 10.30. There is a cloud forest in this area so you'd have to get there very early or be very lucky to strike the World's End without a lot of cloud.  But they said, I didn't mind standing near the edge and watching the cloud roll in and up and over the cliff face.  Sit long enough and the cloud lightens enough for you to see the valley below and some of the tea fields. If you follow the track on the left it is the shortest to the viewing platforms but it makes the walk back via the falls a steeper climb, so I personally preferred walking anti-clockwise and getting to the platform after the crowds and then having an easier walk back along the less steep ridge. Frogs, forest pigeon and a Sri Lankan giant squirrel were our rewards for walking this trail.  The squirrel looked like an Australian tree kangaroo in the face but had a large bushy tail.  You can hear the bear monkeys in the jungle here as well and we're so lucky in that on the very bumpy drive back down the plateau a bear monkey was posing for us on a tree Top. So keep a look out. As walks go it was moderate - some steep slippery sections, and the landscape it crosses was quite interesting - undulating hills, interspersed with grasslands and forests. I don't know what the park fees were as we did it as part of a package so in some respects it's better not to know and as I think the most expensive fees, it was nice to see the Rangers being very vigilant with hikers as far as long plastics go and to search each bag and advise to bring everything back out. So surprisingly I saw very little plastic litter - the off pieces carelessly dropped but good to see they are trying to keep the area litter free - except the toilet area - unfortunately full of rubbish.","March 7, 2019",0.0,0.0

Yes, as we were never likely to be this way again. So it’s usually a 5 or 6am depart from Nuwara Eliya to get to the entry of the park for when it opens. The entry is about an hour away from Nuwara Eliya. However with a 5am departure time you will be driving in the dark. Better, for me, to have a later departure as the views on the way in are fabulous and, indeed, the best bit of the trip. Once there entry is expensive, indeed, I think it was the top price for entry we paid on our entire Sri Lankan trip. From the entry gates you then drive further into the park before the start of the walk. Once walking it’s a well marked, well worn track. We turned left at the first fork and went to Mini World’s End. This drops you into World’s End a little earlier than if you follow the main track. It’s an interesting walk on a sunny morning, no more. We did see the Bear Monkeys though, which was a highlight. The view from Worlds End is nice enough but for me, not as good as the one from Little Adams Peak. Baker Falls on the walk out are well worth a detour. The drive back to Nuwara Eliya is very pleasant - you’ll be home by lunchtime.","February 27, 2019",0.0,0.0

Going up through Pattipola from Nuwara Eliya allows you to visit the Ambewela Farms and view the rolling farm countryside and dairy herds. Pattipola is also the highest point on the railway going to Ella and the road crosses the tracks at the station. It's best to get to Horton Plains early. Mist rolls in later in the morning and often the views are obscured. It's a 5 km hike to World's End and back via Baker's Falls, also worth seeing. Head back out of the park via the Ohiya road for some spectacular views of the World's End gap from the road. Not exactly the same as hiking to the lookout point but stunning nevertheless. Viewing wildlife is a hit or miss prospect. We saw nothing. But there are some tame Sambhur deer at the visitor center for a photo opportunity.

We were told 3 different distances to the various 'signature spots' and the signposts give a fourth opinion. This should not be attempted by anyone with a hip, knee or ankle problem and hiking boots are almost a necessity. The tracks are not maintained in any way and consist of reasonably steep climbs and descents through deep ruts strewn with boulders, rocks and loose stones. Furthermore it is suppoesed to be a nature walk, and we started before sunrise, only to find around 100 vehicles at the the first gate with several 100 tourists clamouring for tickets. We entered and drove 5kms to the second gate to find even more vehicles and people. Goodness knows what this is like later in the day although when we left at about 9.30 am there must hjave been thousands in the park. As described, walking is difficult and the experience was not helped by crowds of mainly Asian tourists squawking incessantly and noisily with some even playing their radios for all to hear. The result - no wildlife. When we got to either of the World's Ends we could hardly see a not that impressive view for the crowds of photo and selfie taking tourists. There seemed to be neither control nor wardens on hand and most of the guides were more intent on chatting up their attractive customers than controlling the mobs. Our guide, who was embaraseed by the appalling behavious of the tourists and their mentors, did attempt to quieten the mobs but his efforts were in vain. He did advise us not to attempt a visit to Bakers Falls as that requires climbing and descending by holding on to mangrove roots as the tracks are in an even bigger mess.

The entry to the park is around 8400 rupees for two tourists, which is compared with the local's entry fee of 300-500 rupees. On top of the entry fee you also have your tuk-tuk/taxi fee. We paid a flat rate of 3500 rupees from Nuwara Eliya, which is apparently pretty standard. You can obviously split the cost by going in a big group, but I think you then pay extra on your ticket price for taking a larger vehicle. Obviously the cost goes towards the upkeep of the Plain but it is quite steep for anyone touring Sri Lanka on a budget. We got up at 5am to arrive for 6am. Unfortunately upon arrival the ticket machine was broken so we didn't end up getting going until 7:30am(ish).  We got very unlucky with the weather in that the fog didn't lift and so the view was none existent. It's also worth preparing your bag in advance. Plastic isn't allowed, although you can take water bottles but you have to remove any plastic seals and the labels. Plastic bags, cartons of drinks with straws etc will be confiscated. All round, it's meant to be great, but just prepare yourself for the cost, and that you might not seen any views at all!","January 19, 2019",0.0,0.0

Mini World's End was good but World's End was spectacular.  Getting there as early as possible seems to be better before it gets too misty.

Nuwara Eliya is cold at that time of day,and we were very grateful for our padded jackets - make sure you prep well for a cold morning!  The journey over in the dark was, well, interesting - low-lying mist on the unlit roads, speeding drivers trying to overtake at all opportunities (it is Sri Lanka after all!) and low powered tuktuk lights all made for a memorable trip!  After buying our entry tickets ($45 for two people including all fees and taxes) we headed up to the trail head as the sun was coming up, with a few scattered deer out on the plains - fairly magical!  The hike itself is a circular, so you can head either clockwise or anticlockwise - most guides say to go anticlockwise, as you reach Little World's End before World's End but we opted for the latter and didn't regret it at all - it's slightly easier as you get a flattish finish, and you also avoid most of the crowds - once we'd headed out the only people we saw for the first 4km or so were the quicker hikers heading past us (not sure why, this is the sort of place that deserves you take your time to soak in the atmosphere!)  The early start was a killer at 4.30am, but seemed like a great idea now - the light is beautiful at that time of day and there's still the early morning frost on the ground and low-lying mist in the valleys.  Baker Falls are nice (but no Iguazu!) and the views from World's End and it's little brother are great, but for me the real winner was the hike and the scenery - just magical at that time of day, and we felt at times we were no longer in Sri Lanka but maybe south America!  While we didn't see much wildlife on the outward part of the hike we saw quite a bit when heading back after Little World's End - a couple of giant squirrels and a few purple-faced leaf monkeys enjoying a feed in the early morning sun - plus quite a few birds.  The round trip is around 9km or so, but we took our time enjoying the journey.

For someone who doesn’t exercise regularly this would be really tough. But definitely give it a crack. Just know it’s not going to be easy and you need comfortable shoes. Saw so many people out there today in completely inappropriate shoes. I ran clockwise. I’ve read that anticlockwise is easier. Without having run anticlockwise, I think that would probably be right.

First tip is it’s cold, not freezing so I would suggest a jumper you can take off later when it warms up. The tour took us 3hrs 15mins, we are unfit and took numerous of breaks. So for us It’s not an easy trek as others say it was but is definitely it’s doable. There were parts of climbing up rocks that felt like forever! Wear comfortable shoes, there were very slippery muddy areas, and I fell over twice but I’m clumsy. There were lots of rocks that were waiting to trip us over. Oh and do not take any plastic bags in the Park, they are not allowed in. The sights are nice, some very beautiful areas. A few waterfalls to see, I was disappointed we didn’t see any wildlife.

It rained the entire four hours, not heavily. It was 12km according to my Garmin. The weather conditions were horrific & dangerous for a 4 hour 12km hike. The surfaces were rocky, steep, uneven, constantly changing, wet & slippery. It was too misty to see much & our guide just walked off ahead most of the time. It was so slippery he slipped over near the start. It was a most difficult, never ending walk in shocking conditions & should have been cancelled. The one highlight was Bakers Falls which were spectacular and heaps of water falling. We met up with three lovely young Chinese girls who walked we us. We enjoyed chatting with them & they were far more considerate & helpful to me than our guide. One of them also slipped over. We are in our early 60s & fortunately both very fit. It was the most arduous walk which I thought with never end. We walked to Worlds end where there were meant to be spectacular views but all we saw was mist. There was a bit of a view at Little Worlds end. I couldn’t believe how often the terrain under foot changed. It was such a relief to finally finish at 12.30 pm.

It is dominated by Kirigalpoththa (2.389 meters) to west and Totupolakanda (2,357 meters) to the north. Kirigalpoththa and Totupolakanda are the second and third highest mountains in Sri Lanaka. Tha charm of the plateau and encircling mountain range, often concealed mist, is enhanced by Baker's Falls and the two two escarpments, Small Worlds End (274 meters) and Big Worlds End (884 meters). The plateau is drained by tributaries of Mahaweli Ganga (main river of Sri Lanka) to the north (Agra Oya) and the Walawe Ganga to the south (Belihul Oya), serving as an important catchment area for these two rivers which have been harnessed for irrigation and hydro power. This plateau consists of many Amphibians, three types of harmless reptiles, birds and mammals including the leopard. Access to the plains are mainly from Ohiya, Pattipola and Nuwara Eliya. There are foot trails from Nagarak Trail is from the Agrapathana - Diyagama Tea Estate and also from Belihul Oya which falls into the same Nagarak Trail.

This cost 2500lkr, as the drive is over an hour and the tuk-tuk driver waited for 3hrs (return trip). Entrance to the park is expensive, probably too expensive, but there is no way of avoiding this. However, the circular 9km hike once you're within the park is very rewarding. The path is fairly challenging as there are a range of terrains, from sandy red coloured rocky river-bed style paths, narrow paths with 4000ft drops at one side, and flat ordinary trails along the plains. There is much wildlife to see, as well as the views. As for the plains, they looked not unlike the Yorkshire Dales in England, except with Rhododendron bushes! This area was a refreshing change of terrain from the endless yet beautiful hill views which are common in the area. Make sure you get there between 06:00 - 07:00 am to get the most out of the views. Cloud cover usually lifts at this time, then falls again a few hour later. Despite this, the views are only part of the experience. For me, the hike was the most enjoyable aspect of the visit, as well as the unusual early morning jungle sounds.","June 10, 2018",0.0,0.0

Saying that the weather that day wasn’t the best but it least it was dry. The 9km walk though was lovely. We basically had the whole park to ourselves (we saw maybe 20 people during our visit) and it was picturesque, beautifully quiet and the local wildlife were so used to people that they would come over to you or at least not run away when you approached. So did we get to see Worlds End? Unfortunately not, but whether we got up really early and chanced it or did what we did I think the chances for that day was limited due to the time of year. What I will say though is it didn’t take away the enjoyment we had of walking around the route, seeing the wildlife and experiencing the quietness.

There was not one, but many reasons for that. To go to Horton’s Plains one has to start early. In fact, as early as 5AM and for that we would have to wake up at least at 4AM. Not to mention the unbearable cold outside. On top of that, Horton plains had a lot of mixed reviews about the walks and the views it offered. All that too for a extravagant entrance fees. We were struggling with the thought of waking up that early and going out in the cold on a long walk where the possibility of views being completely blocked by the clouds was high. But then on the other hand, we did wish to go ahead with the plan, given that we had come all the way along. At the end, we did go there. After a drive of an hour and a half, we reached the entrance where we booked the tickets, and paid the cab entrance fees. Even at that time, the place was overly crowded with tourists and their vehicles. A heavy fog was around. We thought we were prepared for the cold. As suggested by a few blogs, I was wearing 5 layers of warm clothing. We got off the cab and went to join the long queue for the entrance tickets. The cold was unbearable and soon we were shivering. Thankfully the tickets were finally sorted out and we got back in the cab, to drive towards the entrance gate. The fog had slowly started to clear up as we started with the walk. It was a three hour closed trail, a simple trek with a little up and down slopes and a little rocky patches here and there. Nothing scary. The fog is basically created by cloud forests in the Horton’s plains. Luckily enough, the sun popped out of the clouds, clearing up the fog. The Baker’s falls offered a pretty view. We got clear, unhindered views form World’s end view point. What Luck! But then, the views were actually not that impressive. And the walk was not that challenging. I would like to mention one impressive thing about the management of Horton plains. At the entrance, they have a baggage check point where no tourist is allowed to proceed with a piece of plastic, may it be a bag or a bottle or a chewing gum box, thus keeping Horton plains plastic free. I think this is a very sensible step and ideally should be followed everywhere around the world.","May 13, 2018",0.0,0.0

Before entering the territory of the reserve, a ticket office with a queue for 10 - 20 minutes. We were with a personal guide who took care of entrance tickets but you can go by  yourself (get lost if you do not turn off the way is impossible). There is a parking before the start of the route, where both the touristic and personal cars park. There is also a cafe that looks rather suspicious, but our guide said that it is possible to have a tea and eat traditional pastries. It was not bad! The toilet is located at the back of the cafe, it is better to visit it, because there are no more lavatories on the entire route. Despite the clouds during the entire walk and a fairly cool temperature in the morning in the first 2 hours, the noses and cheeks burned, so you must always apply a protective cream, then a walk of at least 9 km will be comfortable and enjoyable. The road in places is sometimes rather stony and difficult, therefore it is better to choose another occupation for children and people with limited motor abilities. The nature is amazing, the silence, the singing of birds and the murmur of water in streams, passing into small rivers and waterfalls are interrupted only by groups of passing tourists. Early in the morning saw one deer and several roe deer grazing not so far from the cafe. On the way there were chameleons and earthen small lizards, many birds.

The journey was around an hour in a TUK TUK (2500rps return journey) with 30 mins cueing. Most people come at this time to avoid peak heat and to see the views at worlds end without clouds. The route although not sign posted well can be done easily without a guide. Don’t worry there’ll be plenty of walkers around from all ages doing the walk at the ungodly hour. You can choose 2 routes: route 1 is the one to your left and goes straight when you reach it. This will take you to mini worlds end, worlds end and bakers fall in that order. Plus point - you’ll def get to the main attraction without clouds. Down side is you’ll have a harder trek back uphill. Route 2- this is the one we chose. The path when you reach the first bifurcation is the one going down the steps ahead of you. This will lead you to bakers falls, worlds end and mini worlds end in this order. Plus point - it’s an easier journey back as it’s mainly downhill returning. Down side - by the time we got to mini worlds end it was so cloudy we couldn’t see the view! Either way both routes are around 11 km loop. It’s relatively easy- just feels very long and you get hot! Took us 4 hours at a leisurely pace. Make sure you get your hotel to pack you a breakfast box so you can eat it when you’re having a break there. The cost of the ticket depends on how many of you are there in your group- the more of you going the cheaper it will be individually.

Nonetheless, the walk was a highlight of our trip to Sri Lanka. There is a small exhibition and (paid) toilets. I was a bit miffed to see that the exhibition asks what damage you have done by visiting the park that day: if visitor numbers are such a concern, then perhaps pricing and entrance policies should be amended rather than passively criticising the people who have paid $25 for the privilege of visiting the park.","May 4, 2018",0.0,0.0

The scenery is beautiful! There are rolling hills, a beautiful waterfall and spectacular views from both World's End and Mini World's End. Tips: - Go early! The walk takes about 3 hours in total and about 1.5 hours from the starting Point to reach World's End (the main viewing point) We left our hotel in Newara Eliya at 5.30 and started walking at 7am. - Wear runners and comfortable clothes - I'd recommend layers (as it can be chilly at 7am and very warm by 9am). We were lucky with the weather but apparently it rains at lot so bring a raincoat). - Do the walk anti-clockwise! There's a main path from the carpark up to the start of the loop. At the sign board go straight ahead (most people to left). The first part of the walk is open to the elements so offers beautiful views as the sun rises and it's nicer to do this part of the walk when it's a little cooler (If you walk in the other direction there is little shelter from the sun as you're returning). Also there are less crowds at the waterfall!","May 4, 2018",0.0,0.0

Try and head out early cos if u r late the views at the worlds end would be covered in mist . We did the trek at the end of march the weather was pretty good . Carry a bottle of water and some light snacks as there is nothing available on the route inside . A small shop located outside sells water biscuits and basic Sri Lankan snacks,"April 30, 2018",0.0,0.0

Perhaps due to season in Nuwara Eliya the park was absolutely crowded. Which we did not like that much but i think this is not something we can't avoid. However the park was spectacular as ever. weather was very kind to us in everyway. We had a perfect day.,"April 30, 2018",0.0,0.0
