I think it was about 4 kms through a tea estate and eventually the road turned into a track before reaching several communication towers. Then there was a path that led me around the fenced compounds which eventually led to the ""Single Tree"", but i guess there were at least three trees there now, surrounded by tea trees. The single tree was easy to recognise as there were orange scarves tied to the tree and a few figures at the base, which served as a shrine. From this vantage point there was a wonderful view of the town, racetrack, Gregory Lake and surrounding hills and it was well worth spending 15 minutes up here. There seemed to be another path leading back to the small road, but after a while i had to retrace my steps as it became impossible to follow.","April 2, 2018",0.0,0.0

From there it's simple - the road snakes up through a tea plantation, past a temple and towards the masts. Once you get to the masts there's a narrow track between two fences that takes you to the view over to Gregory Lake. There's a seat to have a rest. From there we headed back to the main track, then continued along the crest of the hill on a narrow track, which eventually drops at some huts. We cut right here and joined Unique View Road back down the hill, with a beer stop at Qantara Hotel, which has a terrace with a view! Nice to do the loop rather than up and down.

It is off Queen Elizabeth Road, about 50 from Haddon Hill Road, and next to Clifton Inn. Once you are on that road, there can be no mistake about how to proceed. The road starts as a narrow asphalt road winding itself up to a beautiful monastery, about half way to the top. It continues as a narrow dirt road which can be driven with a high clearance vehicle or tuk-tuk.  Unfortunately there is a lot of trash dumping along the way. We walked up and down, which took about 45 minutes each way, with plenty of stops for taking in the marvelous views of the tea landscape below us.

I really enjoyed it. It was a bit hard to find the path though (yes, there is one!). Go along the Queen Elisabeth road, then turn right to the Haddon Hill road all the way to Teabush hotel, where the road end. The Teabush is fenced and you need to go around the fenced area from its right side. There is a narrow slippery path. It is disappearing at times, but try to keep following it, it zig-zags all the way to the top. If you lose sight of it, just go up among the bushes (thats what I did half of the way as I didnt know about the path) - you will eventually come across it again. Wouldnt recommend this walk with children, but its a nice outing if you have a few hours to kill. The view is brilliant.","December 25, 2017",0.0,0.0

Underway you can visit a Buddha temple if you like. We didn't enter, but it looked good from the outside. On top you can see the lake, the horse track and various other things in town. Just take the small path on the right between the antennas and enjoy the view! A little bit further there is a small path to the left through some small trees. You'll end up in a tree plantation and can go through it to go down the hill.
