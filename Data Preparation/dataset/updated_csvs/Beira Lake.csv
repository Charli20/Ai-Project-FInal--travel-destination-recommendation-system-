It is said that the lake used to be much bigger over a century ago, however as of present day, it has been scaled down to about 150 acres as a result of the rapid commercialization. According to the records, the lake has been created by Portuguese to protect their base during 1500s and then evolved to be a landmark during the British ruling and on. As of late, it became famous for a number of recreational activities, such as rowing and yachting.

I stayed at a hostel at Vauxhall Street and capitalized on the near distance to the two lakes to explore the area. Beira Lake reminded me of the old Singapore River unsightly and with a foul smell, nothing fascinating or enchanting. But the fact that the lake occupies a central position in the bustling commercial hub of Colombo, it can capitalize on her strategic location to regenerate and revitalize itself from a lackluster lake to a clean and picturesque lake that promote the dynamism of this metropolis city. The old smelly Singapore River went through a stage of rejuvenation, purification and transformation to evolve into a sparkling body of water that blends beautifully and harmoniously with the spectacular skyline of the skyscrapers surrounding her. Undisputedly, the river has become an iconic structure that catapults Singapore into the forefront of the financial world. I think Beira Lake has the same potential to transform herself and advertise Sri Lanka to the world. South Beira Lake is much more beautiful than the mother Lake itself. It is where the Seema Malakaya Buddhist meditation temple is located. It is more well-design with clearly defined contours and appears calm and serene matching the temple and the surrounding buildings. The Colombo City Centre mall is located opposite the Buddhist Temple. I went up to the upper floor of the mall where the food studio was located and found the panoramic lake view gorgeous. The Colombo Lotus Tower stands like a torch at one end of the Beira Lake. It reminds one that this is a Buddhist country. The lotus flower blooms out of the mud. The lotus flower represents potential, enlightenment and spiritual awakening. The lay person is born into this muddy world of ignorance but he has the potential to achieve enlightenment out from this `muddy' world. The Beira Lake really looks muddy. The Colombo Fort Train station, the Pettah market area, the Bally's Casino, the Sri Lanka Air Force Headquarters, the Slave Island Police Station, the Lake House colonial architectural building, the Regal Cinema theatre and the Cinnamon Lake Hotel are few `attractions' in the vicinity of the Beira Lake. I was impressed with the elegant interior layout of the 4-star Cinnamon Lake Hotel. I also visited a nearby church and some street art gallery while exploring the lake. In fact, I explored the entire shore of the Beira Lake when I walked from the Colombo  Fort train station to the Maradana train station. I noticed there are a number of warehouses at this south part of the lake. There is no `wow' factor for this Beira Lake but if you are staying around the Slave Island area, you definitely will come across this Lake and looming Lotus Tower from a distance.","April 13, 2019",0.0,0.0

This lake should be cleaned to become a place of beauty in the middle of the city. Somewhere that local people could come and enjoy in their spare time. We walked all the way round and the paths have trip hazards all over the place, they need repairing desperately. The island in the middle of the lake houses a temple which we did not visit also there is a temple which again only viewed from the pathway. Tried to find out why the lake is green but couldn’t get a definitive answer from anyone.

Beira lake was mach larger earlier and it had been connected with intricate system of canals providing a way of transportation in Colombo. Currently there are two islands in the lake. One is splendid Seema malaka viharaya and other one is known as ""Kala Doowa"" (Kala Island). Seema malakaya contains a wooden pavilion which is covered by blue color  roofing tiles. It is designed by well known architect - Bevis Bava. This small island also contains a stupa, bodhi tree and small shrines for local gods and goddesses. If you are planing to go there mind your dress since this is a religious place. The pavilion is surrounded by many buddha statue. The Kala island is lover's hot spot. Its garden is maintained satisfactorily.  It is interesting to see some cute rabbits hop here and there. The main problem here is, the water is so polluted and contains a bad odor. It is due to an algae grown in this water. But it is not a big problem to have a swan boat ride here.
