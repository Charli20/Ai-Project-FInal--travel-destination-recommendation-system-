But, beware of the money exchange called Lanka forex pvt ltd. on second floor, they are scammers, they didn't give us the right amount, Rs 22,000 less when we counted, back in our hotel. When we complained. They panicked, and said it must be a fault in their counting machine, after we insisted on cctv footage. They said they will put the rest of money they owed, into our account and took details as we were going on tour next day. Never gave us the money, despite promising. Stopped answering our calls.

There is a good reason for it. It serves very tasty meals at budget prices with much courtesy. The cuisine is Southern Sri Lankan. As is common to Malls all over the world, the eateries especially the popular ones can be very crowded at peak lunch and dinner times. Crescat Mall is no exception. Claypot can really get crowded at lunch time since it is the most popular restaurant at the Mall. And the only one that serves Sri Lankan food. The others serve Indian, Thai, Malaysian, Chinese and Mongolian food. So Claypot has its regular clientele from the office workers, shoppers and tourists at lunch time. If you want to avoid the huge line-up at lunch time, go there just before 12 noon. In the evenings it is not so crowded as the office workers and tired shoppers go home for dinner and so it is mostly those out for an evening  with their families who will go there for a bite of something. The food is very tasty. You could get white or brown rice with four curries, fish or chicken for Rs.400 ($2.63). If you choose to pay by credit card, you get a 10% discount at Rs. 360 ($2.37). These prices are lower than one would pay as tips for a budget lunch in some of the cheap eateries in New York. A lunch at Claypot would cost about $15.00 at a cheap eatery in New York. Service charge and tips would be extra. In the evenings, in addition to rice and curry, this outlet has other Sri Lankan favorites such as kottu roti, stringhoppers, pittu and gothamba roti, all at reasonable prices. There is also the lamprais packets, made famous in Sri Lanka by the Dutch. I am always amazed by the courtesy shown by the employees to all the customers. Most of the employees wear a “permanent” smile and are always patient and helpful to the customers. I wonder how they are able to do it when they have hundreds of customers to serve. It is difficult to recommend anything as outstanding since all their dishes are excellent. Yet their seafood dishes have a slight edge over other dishes, especially the fish and sprats (small fish) curries. A typical meal at Claypot will cost only half as much as in Urban Kitchen in Colombo where the meals are priced according to weight. Urban Kitchen is also a favorite Sri Lankan restaurant of mine. The advantage of Urban Kitchen is that  you can eat in peace and not besieged by crowds as at a Food Court in a Mall. Bon Apetit 349richardsc New York","December 12, 2017",0.0,0.0
