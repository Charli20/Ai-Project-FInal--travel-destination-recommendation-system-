It is not worth it in our opinion. It's kind of a forest, we haven't seen any animals (just monkeys). Birds are all we heard. In the lake at the entrance are fish and turtles. We discovered a kingfisher after all. Unfortunately, however, we must warn against leeches. Don't go to the park with sandals and bare feet. Even with sturdy shoes and socks, the beasts in the shoe bit me through the socks. With bare feet, these things really strike. You can barely recognize them, but they're nasty.","April 9, 2025",0.0,0.0

Some caves to see with paintings. Great but small Kandy town view. Bike hire is 500 for 2hrs, however, they don't have bikes that are suitable for kids under 12. Toilet facilties available at both ends of the park. It takes maximum 2hrs to walk around the largest loop, but can be cut and you can walk directly to the town lookout and average information centre and back within 45mins. Only downside is that you my stumble across an elephant prison camp at Point C on the map where 2 male elephants are chained to the trees slightly below the walking track. This was very upsetting to see as they were very distressed shaking their heads continuously side to side. Entry fee is Rs 900 for adults and Rs450 for children under 12.

It is a must to visit the sanctuary, if you are in Kandy. All in all, it is our duty to safeguard this wonderful nature reserve.

The tourist info guy practically begged me not to go because of the leeches! I thought of the big (presumably slow) leeches in the awesome film Stand By Movie and thought 'I'll be fine'. As I was entering two tourists left, one with blood trickling down leg from leech wound - ok maybe the threat is real! But I thought, if I keep a lookout surely a big slow leech can’t get on me. What I didn’t know is these leeches are thin, fast and so agile! I was moving fast and yet - agh! One on my sock trying to burrow through! Then another on my other sock. I used my hotel keycard to get them off quick but both had drawn blood (only a drop). Then one was on my arm! How did it get there?! Luckily I got this one off before it got me. I turned round and sprinted back for the main path. Sticking to the bigger path, that can take vehicles, was fine - this is a short (maybe 40 minutes) route including views over Kandy (where lots of monkeys were). The longer route of several kms is where the leeches were. I don’t know if it’s the same all year round, but probably best not to go when wet at least.","December 21, 2019",0.0,0.0

We only had a few hours to spare before moving south down the country and were glad we took this opportunity. We were picked up in a car at the hotel, and driven there in what only took about 15 minutes. It was early morning, roughly 7am, and the park was empty. Other than our guide we did not see anyone else. This made it all the more peaceful. If you're an early riser, i'd recommend going early. It lent itself to some wonderful scenes of mist clearing and the sun starting to break through the trees. Good photo opportunities. As others have said, there are plenty of monkeys going about their daily business. Additional wildlife we encountered included a deer, a few species of butterfly and a kingfisfer. One of the unexpected points of note, was the enourmous Puss-well (Giant Liana) tree. It's about 200 years old and spreads over an area of nearly 2 hectares. That information is thanks to a photo I took of the sign rather than my memory, but the way which the trees branches twisted and grew were certainly memorable and something i'd never seen before. There were longer routes to take, so you could spend more than the couple of hours we did, depending upon how much you enjoy such walks. The scenary within the forest was very good throughout and you also get to see some good views over Kandy at one point. Wildlife was intermittant, which was fine for us. The sections we did were fairly flat. There was one steep section to see a cave, which was optional rather than on the main route. If you book via that hotel, we found the guide Nithan to be very knowledgable. He is someone who is massively passionate about wildlife, and we got on to talking about his current research papers on plastics and how Sri Lanka might implement policies to address the amount currently impacting the wildlife in Kandy and beyond. Overall we throughlly enjoyed this and would happily recommend to enyone who likes fairly easy walks in a beautiful surrounding with a spot of wildlife.","August 13, 2018",0.0,0.0

You do not need a guide, although they may be able to provide explanation of the sanctuary’s history (we read about it before and after and found that was enough). The only thing to watch out for is the leeches. We only had an issue with this when trying to hike to the lookout (which in the end we couldn’t find - it may be overgrown by large trees now or we may have missed the trail as there are a few leading to the top). The leeches are quite small but easy to spot wriggling up your shoes. Spraying your shoes/feet and legs with insect repellent beforehand would solve this problem.

You will also pretty much have the entire forest for yourself, as there’re no tourists there in the morning.

The forest is a paradise for flora & fauna & there are wild boar, monkeys, monitor lizards, water monitors, porcupines, kingfishers, owls, cranes, & many other birds, insects & flowers. Walk around & explore nature while listening to the multitude of chit chat of the birds. Please be aware that you're in a forest in a tropical country. If the ground is wet, you're going to have leeches, so be prepared.

Relatively unknown by tourists or those who do know about it don't think it's worth going to. But i loved it! I would recommend taking a tuk tuk up to the sanctuary as the reserve entrance is up a rather steep hill which isn't ideal when you're about to walk around a forest. Within minutes of entering the hustle and bustle of the city disappears and all you can hear is the birds and insects around you. There was a group of monkeys hanging around at the entrance trying to steal food from a group who were leaving but they weren't aggressive or trying to steal sunglasses etc, i would still watch out though. Quietness is key and you'll be surprised how much comes out of the forest when you let it come to you. I saw a couple of barking deer, LOADS of birds and I had a close encounter with another group of monkeys who played around my feet and ran up to sniff my bags and climbed the trees beside me. There are a few different path circuits you can take so you can spend as much or as little time there as you want. I spent almost 4 hours there and only left because I ran out of bottled water! There isn't anywhere to buy food or water so bring your own. There are places to sit and have a picnic if that's what you'd like. The forest information centre is great also with a chap who will talk you through the area and things to look out for.","January 9, 2018",0.0,0.0

It's a lovely rest from the sun, as the majority of the trail is shaded by the trees. We saw monkeys, wild boar, deer, birds & butterflies within the forest park and only a few other people. There are a couple of places to stop, admire the nature and perhaps have a picnic (although you might have to watch out for food-stealing monkeys). The park is definitely worth the 650 rupees fee (£3.25 - the price of a coffee in England) & you are given a map upon payment. The city viewpoint has lovely views of the lake and this is the first point we saw a family of wild boars. From here we tried to go down a trail that pointed to Garison Cemetery (on the park map), however a man called to us from the top of the stairs, saying it was out of the park grounds and we couldn't enter, so we turned back. Next we tried to find Kodimale flag point (the highest point of the forest), there was a sign pointing us in the right direction from the main track, success! But after following this track we found a five way fork with no further sign... we walked down a few of these paths but couldn't see to find the flag point. There is also a temple on the map however the route down to this was closed of, we did however find some of the caves which were interesting to see. In terms of nature & an enjoyable walk I would give the forest four stars, but because some of the points of interest in the park seemed difficult to find/we weren't permitted to see, (perhaps could do with a few more signposts,) I gave it three. Definitely would still recommend as an enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours.","May 11, 2017",0.0,0.0

DO NOT hit the monkeys or they will ALL attack you. Just wave the stick, do not touch the monkeys with stick.

Kandy town itself is quite overwhelming, very busy, dusty and dirty. Generally in Sri Lanka the people are friendly, welcoming and kind, however we found many people in Kandy (and certainly not all) quiet rude and always trying to con tourists. For example tuk tuks should cost around 100 rupees per mile but we were charged 500 rupees to go from town to the sanctuary (just over a mile). I know you are expected to negotiate however the people here seem to have gotten wind of prices in the U.K. and the west generally and just charge whatever they think you will pay. To some extent I don't mind paying more as a tourist however here you get the impression that the locals are enjoying conning you. The sanctuary was a nice way to get out of the town. It was quiet and peaceful and offered a quick getaway from town. We only really saw monkeys in the park and there was nowhere to buy water. There are toilets but they aren't the nicest.. there was also quite a lot of rubbish around the place which was a shame as the monkeys were playing with the plastic bottles. The entrance fee is 650 rupees (approximately £4ish) which is very reasonable however the local entry cost which is listed at the door is 30 rupees (20p) another example of how people seem to think here. Again I really don't mind paying double or even triple the local cost as a tourist but twenty times the cost is crazy especially when the same goes for food, transport and accommodation. The prices are higher in other cities for a reason, the place is clean and sewage is not flowing through the streets! If you do need to go to Kandy the park is worth a visit but if going to Sigiria rock or attractions in the north then stay closer to them for a more enjoyable day trip and to avoid Kandy town.","October 16, 2016",0.0,0.0

I'm not sure why people complain of leeches because the main track is actually a dry dirt road fit for cars to drive on. Maybe it's different after a lot of rain, but just make sure you wear covered shoes. There are options of going off the main track into the forest for a more challenging hike and in that case you might want to be more covered up. It was a very easy 5km walk to go the whole way around on the main track. We didn't see any animals or birds other than 2 separate groups of macaques that were on the track. Im a little afraid of macaques and don't like going near them. Both times, the larger leader of the troupe came close to check us out but they mostly kept their distance from us. I've learnt it's always best not to feed them or show them you have any food at all. I don't look at them directly and just keep walking. There were deer or boar tracks everywhere so there must be quite a few animals in the forest, but it was a public holiday and maybe too many people around. It really wasn't crowded though, with only a few groups of people on the tracks.

The rangers at the front who sell tickets are scammers through. The entrance fee is 650 rupees. So I counted out 6 x 100 rupee notes and one 50 rupee note. They said ok and gave me a map (no ticket) but just 30 seconds after walking off they called me back and said that I was short 100 rupees. While my back was turned they pocketed one of the 100 rupee notes leaving only 5 on the counter. It was pointless to argue so I just handed over one more. Despite this the sanctuary is beautiful and well worth a visit. It's 250 acres just behind the Temple of the Tooth. Head west from the Temple up the street with the Pizza Hut and the Queen hotel on the corner. Go about 400m and turn right at the first set of traffic lights. Follow the winding road up the hill (easily walkable). The rainforest is pristine as it has been preserved by the Kings since the 1200s. The walking trails are well marked and easy. There are troops of monkeys which show no interest in people and which, unlike elsewhere in SE Asia are not aggressive and just walk calmly past you as if you're not there.  It's amazing to walk past a whole family of monkeys so close (within a metre) while they mind their own business, carrying their babies and grooming each other with none of the aggressive behaviour you usually see in monkeys that live this close to humans. In a 2 hour visit I also saw wild boar and tiny deer. It's so peaceful and lovely and incredible to think it's an easy 20 min walk from Kandy city.

That lasted till 12noon when the hotel manager suggested that we go to the rain forest for a walk. One tuk tuk later, We headed in with our map and local emergence phone, provided by the hotel. At first it was wonderful, huge trees covered in giant vines with monkeys and snakes all over the place. Ants and millepedes the size of your largest finger. Confidently guiding my family with the map i directed them deeper and deeper into the rain forest. The canopy was so dense that it made the forest floor dark. We stopped for a drink then I felt it! I though it was an ant bite, sharpe and pin point pain. I looked down and nearly dropped with the shock. There were five or six leeches on my leg and foot. Bear Grills I am not, I flicked them off and sprinted forward hoping to leave them behind us, the kids followed in panic as there father led the way. My Wife calm and collected walked along, laughing until she too realised that if you stood still the leeches were all over you. I looked down at the ground and the forest floor was alive with leeches. Every two or three inches there was a leech stretching it's neck upward, swaying hoping to find some pale Irish skin. We ran for 3 to 4km through deep jungle as the leeches could not latch on when you ran. In the panic and noise of us all getting eaten alive I realised that i missed jogging. This was fun, soft ground, great scenery and laughs (fear). Who knew, all I missed was the correct motivation. I wondered if they used leeches on usain bolt, no? Should have, they work. Well after a 30min run we got back to the path and onto civilisation. My 10yr old son looked up at me and said ""Dad you have three leeches on your face"" f€&@....... I shouted.

After entering the forest take a left-left to follow the anti-clockwise route until you eventually reach a visitor's center (one hour walk). From there, continue 100m to exit the park left-ish towards the Kandy lake side and you are back into the city. Do not expect too much birds but clean air and quietness are kind of priceless too. Walking paths are well maintained so buggy's can be taken there (only in dry season).

As a school boy I used to come here to study at times. When we studied Botany our class mates & lecturers came here for practical lessons. It was just jumping over the college fens & we were in Udawattekelle. History states that there are mystical powers at Udawattekelle. In folklore It is stated that the oppressed/weak are strengthened & turn tables on the predator in this sanctuary. I found a office in the middle of the sanctuary that has books on Udawattekelle at a nominal fee.   I also found a book written by Dr. Nihal Karuanaratne on Udawattekele which is not in print now(only 1 edition had been printed in 1986). Only a few libraries have this book which talks extensively about this sanctuary. Photographers be at the lake by 05.30 am. The best months for this are Nov - February. Take a strong tripod & a shutter delay timer. The view from the other end of the  sanctuary overlooking the lake / above the Dalada maligawa is spectacular in the evenings. Take some Siddalepa balm as there are leaches. Apply it on your feet & hems of trousers , Sides of shoes before you enter. Never allow children under 12 years alone. Never try to wander alone. Never feed the monkeys or even encourage them near you. There are 2 groups of monkeys. The Udawattekelle gang & the Aruppola/Lewella gang. Udawattekelle is one of their meeting places. Never get close when they clash. Read their body language & retreat as fast as possible. I have seen these 2 gangs of monkeys clash for many years. Never show any sign of fruit, biscuits, bread, cakes, savories or sweets. They have got used to eating all these for many years. They approach you without fear & grab the food from you. So don't eat in their presence. Report any misbehavior  of any one. That includes shouting loud. This is a place of silence. One must only take photographs & leave only your footprints. This sanctuary is the center of the ecology system in Kandy & therefore it should be preserved. It was saddening to see names & slang cut into the giant bamboo trees around the lake at Udawattekelle.

During the days of the Kandyan Kingdom Udawatta Kele was known as ""Uda Wasala Watta"" in Sinhalese meaning, ""the garden situated above the royal palace"". The sanctuary is famous for its extensive avifauna. The reserve also contains a great variety of plant species, especially lianas, shrubs and small trees. There are several giant lianas. Many of small and medium size mammals that inhabit Sri Lanka can be seen here. Several kinds of snakes and other reptiles might also be seen. Udawatta Kele was designated as a forest reserve in 1856, and it became a sanctuary in 1938. The Sri Lanka Forest Department has two offices in the reserve, one of which (i.e. the one located at the southeastern entrance) has a nature education centre with a display of pictures, posters, stuffed animals, etc. Being easily accessible and containing a great variety of flora and fauna the forest has a great educational and recreational value. Groups of school children and students regularly visit the forest and the education centre. The forest is also popular with foreign tourists, especially bird watchers. The forest is also of religious importance as there are three Buddhist meditation hermitages and three rock shelter dwellings for Buddhist monk hermits. It has been recorded that the Brahmin called Senkanda, from whose name the city's original name Senkandagalapura derives, lived in a cave in this forest. The rock-shelter or cave now known as the Senkandagala-lena is located on the slope above the temple of the tooth and can be visited. The legend says the brahmin brought a sapling of Jaya Siri Maha Bodhi here and planted it in the present day site of Natha Devale. It was used as a pleasure garden by the Kandyan kings. The forest was reserved for the Royal family and the pond situated in the forest was used for bathing. The public was restricted from accessing the forest hence the name Thahanci kele (Sinhalese for Forbidden forest). During the colonial era some of the land near the Temple of the Tooth was used to build the Kandy garrison cemetery. In 1834 Governor Horton built a path, Lady Horton's drive, within the forest in remembrance of his wife. Henry W. Cave mentions the trail is about three miles long. Lady McCarthy's drive, Lady Torrington's road, Lady Anderson's road, Gregory path, Russell path, Byrde lane and Lady Gordon’s Drive on which the Trip Advisor listed Kandy Cottage is located  are the other named walks in the forest. Some are abandoned and overgrown now. Udawatta Kele is situated on a hill ridge stretching between the Temple of the Tooth and the Uplands-Aruppola suburbs. The highest point of the ridge (7°17'55.41""N, 80°38'40.04""O) is 635 meters above sea level, and 115 meters above the nearby Kandy Lake. The sanctuary contains three Buddhist forest monasteries i.e. Forest Hermitage, Senanayakaramaya and Tapovanaya, and three cave dwellings for Buddhist monks, i.e. Cittavisuddhi-lena, Maitri-lena and Senkadandagala-lena. The sanctuary also acts as a catchment area for the supply of water to the city of Kandy. The visitors' entrance is located on the western side of the forest, about 15–20 minutes walking from the Temple of the Tooth. Directions: From the Temple of the Tooth, go north along the D.S. Senanayaka Veediya road and after half a kilometer turn right at the post office near the Kandy Municipality, and follow the road up the hill. The entrance is on the right side of the Tapovanaya Monastery. It is only a 700m pleasant walk from the Kandy Cottage if you’re accommodated there. There is parking space for cars and vans near the entrance, and a refreshment stall. The entrance fee for Sri Lankan visitors is Rs. 30,-; the fee for foreign visitors is Rs. 570,-. Sri Lankan visitors have to register and leave their identity card at the entrance. Amorous unmarried couples are not allowed to enter the forest. The shady lovers' walk, which runs along the banks of the royal pond, is the most popular walk. During rainy weather there are many leeches lurking along paths that will attempt to suck blood from the feet and legs of unwary visitors. Mosquito repellent or herbal balms such as Siddhalepa will protect against them. The vegetation of the park comprises dense forest, mostly abandoned plantations and secondary formations. Of the 460 plant species that have been recorded in the forest, 135 are species of tree and 11 are lianas. These include 9 endemic species. The forest features an emergent layer, a canopy and an understory. Because of the dense two upper layers, understory is not present everywhere in the sanctuary, especially in areas with the invasive Peru balsam tree, (Myroxylon balsamum) Mahogany trees, (Swietenia macrophylla) and Devil's Ivy, (see Invasive Species section below). A great variety of species are found in the forest. Some common native tree and shrub species are: Acronychia pedunculata (Sinhalese: ""Ankenda""), Artocarpus nobilis (""Wal Del""), Artocarpus heterophyllus (""Kos""), Caryota urens (""Kitul""), Aglaia elaeagnoidea (""Puwanga""), Bombax ceiba (""Katu imbul""), Canarium zeylanicum, Cinnamomum verum (""Kurundu"", cinnamon), Ficus virens, Filicium decipiens (""Pihimbiya""), Goniothalamus gardneri, Haldina cordifolia, Hunteria zeylanica, Mallotus tetracoccus, Mesua ferrea (""Na"", ”Iron-wood”), Michelia champaca (""Sapu""), Mangifera zeylanica (""Atamba""), Neoclitsea cassia (""Dawul Kurundu”, Wild Cinnamon), Glycosmis sp., Litsea quinqueflora, Micromelum minitum (""Wal Karapuncha""), Pavetta blanda, Psychotria nigra, Vitex pinnata (""Milla"") and Walsura gardneri. There are many vine and liana species growing in the Udawattakele forest, most notable is the giant creeper Entada rheedii (""Pus Wel""). Some other species are Anamirta cocculus (""Tittawel”), Diploclisia glaucescens, Hiptage bengalensis, Hypserpa nitida (""Niriwel""), Morinda umbellata (""Kiri-wel""), and Paramignya monophylla. The Udawatta Kele is probably the best place in Sri Lanka for seeing full-grown rattan palms, ''Calamus'' (palm), of which there are at least two species. Some of the climbing palms here are over 25 meters long, growing up and over trees. Elsewhere in Sri Lanka rattan palms are often cut down when young for making rattan, but in the Udawattakele they are well protected. Orchid species, mostly epiphytic, include Cymbidium bicolor, Luisa teretifolia, Polystachya concreta, Thrixspermum pulchellum, Tropidia curculigoides and Vanda testacea. The sanctuary also is home to many species of non-flowering plants, Pteridophytes, such as the large ferns growing on steep banks along the shady road on the eastern side of the hill ridge. The tree species Alstonia macrophylla, introduced from Southeast Asia, is a common pioneer in previously cleared areas but poses no great threat to biodiversity because seeds sprout only in sunny, open areas, and when the trees get large, native shrubs and trees grow beneath them to eventually take their place. Udawatta Kele is a famous birdwatching site. About 80 avifaunal species have been recorded from the sanctuary. The endemic bird species are Layard's Parakeet (Psittacula calthropae), Yellow-fronted Barbet (Megalaima flavifrons), and Brown-capped Babbler Pellorneum fuscocapillus. The rare Three-toed Kingfisher Ceyx erythacus has been observed occasionally. Sri Lanka Myna, Golden-fronted Leafbird, Blue-winged Leafbird, Spotted Dove, Emerald Dove, Tickell's Blue Flycatcher, Crimson-fronted Barbet, Brown-headed Barbet and Black-backed Kingfisher are common in the forest. Red-faced Malkoha and Kashmir Flycatcher are two birds listed as threatened that can be found in Udawatta Kele. Despite the forest reserve being completely surrounded by the Kandy town and its suburbs, there are many kinds of mammals, most of which are nocturnal. Mammals that can be seen the sanctuary are the endemic Pale-fronted Toque Macaque (Macaca sinica aurifrons), Mouse deer (Moschiola meminna), Porcupine (Hysterix indica), Indian Muntjac, Boar, Asian Palm Civet, Golden Palm Civet, Small Indian Civet, Ruddy Mongoose, Indian Giant Flying Squirrel, Greater Bandicoot Rat, Dusky Palm Squirrel, Indian Pangolin, Greater False Vampire Bat, Slender loris and Indian Flying-fox. Several kinds of reptiles also inhabit the forest: There are snakes such as the Common hump-nosed pit viper (Hypnale hypnale), Green vine snake (Ahaetulla nasuta), Green pit viper (Trimeresurus trigonocephalus), Banded kukri (Oligodon arnensis), Boie's rough-sided snake (Aspidura brachyorrhos) Sri Lanka Cat Snake (Boiga ceylonensis), Oriental Ratsnake (Ptyas mucosus) and Spectacled cobra (Naja naja). Lizards that can be seen include the Green Forest Lizard (Calotes calotes), Sri Lanka Kangaroo-lizard (Otocryptis wiegmanni) and the Whistling lizard (Calotes liolepis). There are also several species of skinks, geckos, frogs and toads. Some Sri Lanka wet zone butterflies are also present. The forest reserve has suffered from encroachment by squatters and land grabbing by surrounding land owners, but the forest ecosystem is now mainly threatened by invasive, introduced plant species that increasingly crowd away native plant and tree species and the animals and insects that live on them. These invasive species have no natural enemies such as diseases or insects and animals that feed on them and therefore grow and multiply much more rapidly than in their native habitats. Three introduced species pose the biggest threat to the natural biodiversity of the Udawatta Kele forest: The highly invasive Peru balsam tree Myroxylon balsamum from South America is the first. Dense stands of thousands of young trees can be seen along the roads in the eastern and northern side of the forest. The Pothos or Devil's Ivy, Epipremnum aureum, creeper from the Salomon Islands is the second major threat. In the Northwestern and Western part of the reserve, around the royal pond and near the presidential palace and Temple of the Tooth, the creepers completely cover several hectares of the forest floor. They also climb high up tree trunks, with their large leaves blocking the light for other species underneath. The creepers are gradually spreading further to the east and south. Some years ago they were even planted on road banks elsewhere in the forest. Mahagoney, Swietenia macrophylla, a timber tree from South America, is also quite invasive and disrupts the forest's diverse ecology. The Glow Vine, Saritaea magnifica, from Brazil is another invasive species, and covers several trees near the royal pond and near the Maitri cave. In some areas Aglaoneama communatum, Philippine Evergreen, is covering the forest floor and road banks. Severely degraded forest areas are situated between the Temple of the Tooth, the forest department office at the western entrance, and the slopes northeast of the royal pond. A few patches of unspoiled forest, with mostly native species of trees and shrubs, are remaining on the northern and eastern sides of the forest. There is also a patch of native forest on the southeastern side, near the forest department office at the southeastern entrance. The Forest Department has no management plan to maintain the biodiversity of the forest reserve and is not taking any action to curb the spread of and eradicate invasive species. Necessary control measures would be the uprooting of seedlings, collecting and destroying seeds, and removal of mother trees and creepers. In recent years the population of wild boar, of which there were none or very few in the forest until the early 2000s, has also increased dramatically due to the absence of predators. The boars' digging of the soil for seeking food and making mud-bathing places, causes soil erosion on hill sides and damage to the undergrowth.","February 16, 2012",0.0,0.0
