There were 9 of us altogether, so we had a boat to ourselves. Everyone enjoyed the tour! We left around 8am on a Sunday, and cruising along the canals was such a pleasant experience. Then we were out onto the Negombo Lagoon, which is so big after the canal! We saw lots of birds- including a kite dive down and scoop up a fish on the lagoon. We saw monkeys, some of which were swimming across the canal as we slowly approached. We saw quite a few monitors sunning themselves on the bank. The whole trip was very enjoyable, and one of our friends booked a second trip to take students on. Definitely recommended.","December 4, 2025",0.0,0.0

The mangroves are an amazing tangle of vegetation - that alone is worth a visit. And in spite of the late hour, we got to see kingfishers, herons, kites, eagles, cormorants, pelicans… and countless other birds. And, of course, monkeys and even a young monitor lizard sunning itself on a tree trunk!

Our hotel helped us arrange a boat tour on the Muthurajawela Marsh. We'd read a lot of reviews about this marsh before coming and being a huge lover of seeing animals and photographing them. I definitely wanted to go. We were in Sri Lanka last week of November and so pre tourist season and all the boat operators we'd contacted hadn't opened for the season yet. Our hotel called Praneeth Perera of Muthurajawela by Boat (0774333501  shiranp81@gmail.com) and he was excited and willing to have tourists. Sri Lanka have been hit hard by Covid like many other places but the people are desperate to welcome people back and were delighted to show us around. Praneeth got his boat out and took us on a tour of the marshes. It was beautiful. We didn't arrive until the afternoon so missed the best time of the day to see birds. We saw plenty but apparently early mornings is the prime time. Regardless, we loved it. Praneeth was lovely, his English excellent and he showed us a book afterwards where he teaches himself 4 or 5 new English words a day (blimey they were advanced) all so he can interact better with tourists. Really committed and good knowledge or birds and the marsh. Would recommend! If I'm lucky enough to come back to Sir Lanka again one day I'll do this again, next time in the early morning and I'll use Praneet again next time too. Top tip: Dose yourself in mosquito spray, we were eaten alive on the marshes. Never seen swarms of mosquitos like it. Once the boat gets going you're fine but when it starts and stops there's swarms.","January 12, 2023",0.0,0.0

So, I would have given a higher mark if we had gone later/far earlier, which is not really fair on the park - I'm sure it would be better then and get a higher mark.

So we bought some fruits ( A pineapple, guava, water melon and few bananas) We had a picnic lunch at the starting point of Muthurajawela and visited their small museum too. The cruise was nice and I like the starting too. About 3 km we sailed through the Hamilton canal. Both sides of the canal very green and also filled with brackish water. Then we arrived to the famous Negombo lagoon.  After sailing through the lagoon we came to the wet land sanctuary called Muthurajawela. At the sanctuary we were able to see many birds, few small crocodiles and some brown monkeys. I enjoyed this visit a lot thanking to Mihiraj.

We actually pretested the route by tuk tuk in the morning as I have been having language issues with the guy opposite the resort. The fact he thought I wanted a pharmacy when I tried to pronounce Muthurajawela probably says a lot about other tourists! It appears when travelling south from Negombo that the tuk tuk goes the long way round but we were told at the centre that the route indicated on google maps is now impassable. I note also that the price seems to have increased since May. However at Rp2600 fir two plus Rp2500 for the tuk tuk for 3 hours or so (must stay for the return) it was a lot cheaper than the Rp9000 each being quoted by the hotel. (Presumably get there by aircon car, but the boats are all the same on this route). The  visitors centre contains some quaint background information, reminiscent of a primary school project. There is a restaurant there but it was closed both morning and afternoon. Take correct money, change was nearly a problem. Pee before you get aboard. The trip itself is along the old Dutch canal for about 30 mins, where water monitors, various kingfishers and moorhens abound, plus the odd local trying to handcatch fish in the water. Then into the lagoon proper, and finally into the maze of what are a form of mangrove here. All very pretty and definitely a surprise after the pollution and noise of the mainland. Plenty of birdlife including great grey herons, cormorants, shags, egrets, kites, sea eagles and what looked like an owl. We didn’t see any monkeys or baby crocodiles. I was sceptical about crocodiles, but have since read they do inhabit lagoons throughout SriLanka. Might think twice now about kite boarding on the lagoon! Would probably book the 7.30 am trip next time. I suspect you can just turn up - each boat seats eight passengers and I never saw any with more than 4 people, two passengers, one driver and one guide.

I personally went on my boat ride at 10am, which is not the ideal time to spot wildlife and by then the mid day sun was at its hottest. We took the trip from a place just near the fish market and cost 3000rs for the 6 of us for an hour which proves that boat rides on the marsh dont have to be super expensive. However we did not see many species of bird, probably due to the time that we went but I was nevertheless disappointed. An interesting feature of the ride was that we saw a crab fisherman and he showed us some massive crabs that he caught. We then were able to hold them and have photos taken with then, although this came at extra expense as he expected a tip. Later though I found out that some people hold baby crocodiles when they go out on the marsh so I felt pretty jealous. A few days after this though Idecided to cycle to the Mutharajawela visitor centre around 25km away from negombo. I found out that boat rides cost 1600 rs per person from there. However these boat rides come with experienced tour guides who are good at spotting and identifying wildlife, while the whole overall experience is more pleasant. Each boat has around eight seats and so the boat rides are actually relaxing and peaceful rather than noisy and unwelcoming. The boat rides also go through the canals and then onto the lagoon, rather than just on the lagoon. I saw many species of birds and monitor lizards. The visitor centre however was hard to find and if you are in Negombo it might be less accessible as you will have to pay for a taxi to get there, otherwise you could just do as I did and cycle.Seven or eight in the morning is the perfect time to spot wildlife, such as pelicans, storks, bee eaters, kites, hawks, waders, etc. The visitor centre might be a more expensive than basic boat rides but is well worth it and is a MUST for those interested in wildlife. It is also cheaper than booking boat rides online or at a hotel. It is better to phone then in advance.Their phone number is 94 114 030 150","January 11, 2018",0.0,0.0

Our guide provided bottled water, fresh pineapple and King coconut for light refreshments.  Our trip lasted around 2 hours starting from the beginning of the Dutch canal area. The only downside is the pollution in and around the mangroves. Great trip for any keen photographer.","June 23, 2016",0.0,0.0

Not for those seeking high octane thrills (though you do get pretty close to some very large water monitors) but if you enjoy relaxing on a boat while coconut palms, banana trees, jasmine bushes to say nothing of giant lizards and a variery of birds slide slowly by then there are far worse ways of spending a couple of hours.

Make sure you call the day before. We didn't know that they close at 6:00 pm, so we couldn't book ahead. We called at 7:00 in the morning and they asked us to come by 11:30, by which time it was hot, and too bright for good pictures. Also we didn't see any crocodiles, and only one monitor lizard. But there were a lot of birds and we didn't even need binoculars as our boatman expertly maneuvered us close enough to take pictures even with our phones. Go as early as you can. 2. They sell drinking water, but it's good to come prepared with your own water and a small snack if you haven't had breakfast as the boat ride is 2 hours and the sun can get hot. There is a canopy overhead so it's relatively comfortable. 3. if you have a residence visa (for foreign spouses) they are kind enough to charge you local fees so carry your passport or local ID. (most places also require my marriage certificate, but not here) The guide was very polite and friendly, and every time he pointed something out to us he would start by saying ""excuse me"" because he would interrupt the silence. although it's not THAT silent with the motor boat. 4. Lastly, and most importantly, the phone number and location on Google maps can be found when you search for ""muthurajawela visitor centre"" it also tells you whether they are open that day or not. It's about 20 km from Negombo  beach and took us about half an hour. Google maps ftw! It is government run, and in a wildlife protected area, so you don't need to worry that they'll cheat you. 5.

Try and get the earliest possible slot for the day as most amount of birds/animals can be spotted at the early hours. Managed to see a decent amount/different varieties of birds. Some were migratory birds which are seen only during particular seasons. We also managed to see a crocodile baby and some monitor lizards. There are no eateries/restaurants nearby so please do carry some water and nibbles if you feel like snacking along the way. The guide was knowledgeable and was able to explain a fair bit about the birds and the plants. Recommended if you are keen on bird watching and photography.,"February 12, 2015",0.0,0.0

The location is not very easy to find - booking through a hotel might help, otherwise see my directions below taken from the visitor's guide. I did not have too much time to look at the visitor centre but we had reserved a boat leaving at 4 pm. My brief web-based research indicated first thing in the morning (the centre opens at 7.30 am) or last thing in the day (4 pm for a two hour tour - centre closes at 6 pm) is best. Life jackets provided although very, very gentle journey. My children enjoyed immensely. The trip starts by cruising along a Dutch built canal. This opens into the expanse of the Negombo lagoon. We saw extensive bird life including kingfishers, herons, egrets, kites, as well as a macaque monkey and water monitor. The two crew members - one tracker and the other driving - were very good and eagle-eyed. To enable close-up photography and to avoid disturbing the wildlife, the engine was shut down. I understand that these eco-tours were supported by the Dutch government in the late 90s until 2003. There is no further support. This is run by volunteers and attempting to show visitors the importance of conservation. They should ctainly be supported in their endeavours. Frankly, even if I we had seen no wildlife, it still would have provided a very pleasant way to spend half a day (including time to and from the centre). For reservations, (094)0114030150 or fax (094)0114887325. I also believe that they will soon have a Facebook site. Directions: Take highway from Colombo to Negombo, turn west (seaward) at the Tudella junction, 1 km north of Ja-Ela. Follow the Pamunugama Road. After 4km, just after passing the Bopitiya junction, a signboard on your left hand shows you the approach to the centre (approximately 500 m).","January 22, 2013",0.0,0.0

We left add 5,30 in the morning because we wanted to see as much wildlife as possible. It was really amazing, we saw the sunrise on the lagoon. The guide explained a lot about the way the locals fish in the lagoon standing on the ground in the water. And we got to see al the different fish that they caught. We saw some bats hanging in trees and flying. The guide brought a pinneapple to feed the monkeys, so a lot of monkeys came on our boat. We saw some big water lizzards aswell and lots of birds. It was a really good trip, and because we left so early we got back before it became really hot.","August 17, 2012",0.0,0.0

Absolutely brilliant!! The guide from EcoTours and the resident naturalist at the Jetwing Beach, Arran Sivarajah, were both enthusiastic and knowledgeable making a truly memorable day, spotting 25 species in just 2 hours. Perhaps in order to see this many species you do need an early start like we did. A long lens and binoculars are recommended!!","July 1, 2012",0.0,0.0

Go early-day or late-day to have a better chance of seeing wildlife.  I saw a bunch of herons and a few other critters. Just MAKE SURE you get good directions and instructions.  The bus forget to drop us off at the right place and then some locals pointed us in the wrong direction. For ease, you could get a tuk-tuk but it costs more than the entry fee and tour guide.  Well worth it for a nice birding trip near Negombo. Friendly staff and tour guides.","June 1, 2012",0.0,0.0

Muthurajawela Marsh is a fantastic place to visit & and offers a good introduction to Sri Lankan water-based wildlife. Whilst not as productive as an early morning or late afternoon, a visit during the heat of the day should still yield plenty of interest. I visited a few weeks ago in the late morning. Apart from a couple of other boats at the end of our visit we had the place to ourselves. This was a very peaceful way to spend a couple of hours. The boat has a motor but the driver cuts the engine when you get close to the animals & birds. There is a small visitor centre with some faded posters and a little background information on the marshes and similar habitat in Sri Lanka. The guides are volunteers as the Sri Lankan government withdrew funding for this enterprise several years ago. They deserve a huge amount of credit as they continue to run very informative trips on a shoestring budget. The guide on our trip had a real passion for birds and had better knowledge than any other guide I met during a 3 week stay in the country - including at the big national parks. Visitors can expect close views of a variety of water birds including cormorants, herons, egrets, lapwings, elegant wading birds (seasonal), terns, eagles & kingfishers amongst others. Large water monitor lizards patrol the canal and crocodiles inhabit the lagoon although they are quite shy due to persecution and are best seen in the evening. You will likely also see primates in the trees adjacent to the canal. To get here bargain hard with a tuk-tuk driver in Negombo. Take sun protection as there is no shade on the boat. A pair of pocket binoculars are useful too.","February 3, 2012",0.0,0.0

We visited at the end of our trip around Sri Lanka. After a day driving north from the tourist beach towns through the traffic of Colombo, it was lovely to have a final glimpse of some Sri Lankan wildlife. We saw no other tourists here and had a very peaceful boat ride. We had a small open boat for the three of us and the park guide, who provided complimentary umbrellas for shade.  First we cruised down the canal, stopping to view water monitors and birds on the way. Then we moved out across the marsh and saw macaques and more water birds. The guide was pleasant and knowledgeable. We visited during the afternoon and obviously would have seen much more if we had come early in the morning or in the evening but even so, it was a lovely experience. I think it is probably a good thing for tourists to visit and support the preservation of this lovely wetland. There were some good quality caps and such to purchase as souvenirs from the visitor centre.","October 20, 2011",0.0,0.0
