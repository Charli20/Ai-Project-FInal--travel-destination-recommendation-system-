The area boasts a dense concentration of ancient ruins, the centerpiece of which is the magnificent Vatadage, a circular relic house spanning 18 meters in diameter. This structure features breathtaking sculptural detail, including four beautifully preserved stone Buddha statues. Another key highlight is the Gal Viharaya, a rock temple renowned for its four antique Buddha statues meticulously carved into a large granite cliff face, each depicted in a unique posture. Visitors should observe a modest dress code when exploring these sacred sites: knees and shoulders must be covered. Given the humid climate, it is wise for those wearing shorts to pack a sarong to don before entering temple grounds. Additionally, be prepared to remove your shoes before entering the temple sites.","November 3, 2025",0.0,0.0

However, the family did not want to explore the ruins of the ancient capital of the Sinhalese kingdom. All the more so they are at a decent distance from each other (e.g. lotus pool kilometers away from the museum).. So after leaving my wife and daughter in the cafe with my things, I headed towards the museum. The only free part of the complex is the ruins of Nishshankamalla Palace. It didn't take more than half an hour.

If you have experienced places such as Pompeii, Petra and Jeresh then you will truly appreciate this city. It is very spread out so consider how you will get around. Walking around the whole site is doable but impractical so consider hiring a bike, tuk tuk or even a car as you can drive between the main areas and park easily in designated car parks. Take water as it gets hot and also wear socks as much of the site is made up of temples so you must take off your shoes. If you are barefoot, the ground is very hot and socks will protect your feet. Remember for men and women that legs and shoulders need to be covered in the temple areas. This is a wonderful site with many beautiful remains of buildings with stunning architecture. Another tip...many of the buildings have multiple entrances so don't stand around for ages like everyone else trying to take a perfect selfie and getting in the way. Just walk to a different entrance which I promise you will probably more beautiful than where everyone normally stands.","September 29, 2025",0.0,0.0

Unless you’re a serious history/archaeology buff, this is probably going to be underwhelming. And even if you are, it will quite possibly still be underwhelming. The scale, taken as a whole is impressive, but it’s doesn’t really have that Angkor Wat wow factor plus the lack of information boards (some deliberately destroyed or defaced at that), maps etc for context, frankly useless guides and a high ticket price makes this a missable site from my perspective. We had a car and got through the lot in a couple of hours because to be frank, there wasn’t that much to see. The southern part of the site is in a poor state of preservation and this is exacerbated by a museum that may as well not exist and a disappointing amount of garbage. There are some standout parts of the northern part of the site, specifically Gal Viharaya which are very obviously well cared for. It’s a shame as it was obviously somewhere very important but precious little effort has been put into presenting the site.

As a tour guide, I’m continually impressed by the grandeur and historical significance of Polonnaruwa, which stands as a testament to the island's rich cultural heritage. The city’s well-preserved ruins offer a fascinating glimpse into the medieval era of Sri Lankan history. From the majestic Royal Palace to the intricate carvings of the Gal Vihara, every corner of Polonnaruwa tells a story of a once-thriving capital. The architectural beauty and scale of these ancient structures are nothing short of awe-inspiring. One of the highlights for many visitors is the chance to explore the Parakrama Samudra, an extensive irrigation system built by King Parakramabahu I. The sheer scale and ingenuity of this ancient engineering feat provide a fascinating insight into the advanced technology of the time. Walking through the ancient streets of Polonnaruwa, I love sharing the historical context and legends that bring the site to life. The blend of ancient temples, royal palaces, and elaborate stone carvings creates a rich tapestry of Sri Lankan history and artistry. For anyone interested in exploring Sri Lanka’s cultural heritage, Polonnaruwa is an absolute must-visit. Its historical significance, architectural marvels, and serene setting make it a memorable experience for all.

Be aware, many are classified as culturally sensitive, so shoes off and shoulders and knees covered before you enter. Best to wear attire that is easy to slip on and off or light clothing. Take an umbrella if it is raining as there is very little shelter. It is wise not to take food as the monkeys will cause you problems. To get a full understanding of the history, it is worth hiring a guide, which are readily available at the ticket office.  Enjoy you day.","January 1, 2024",0.0,0.0

The ancient ruins are fantastic and spread out over wide area so you need a car to get to them all. My wife and I spent a long half day morning doing the following: Firstly we purchased the Polonnaruwa Ancient Site entry tickets at the Archaeological Museum in Polonnaruwa. The address is WXRX+PFG in Polonnaruwa It cost US$25pp. They take credit card or cash is accepted. There is a ticket office for locals and separate ticket office for tourists which is a bit further down the path on the right. Tourists can also buy online at the official website of sigiriyafortress. The entry ticket is for 3 areas, and as you visit each area they tear off a stub for each one as you enter that particular part. Near the ticket office is where local guides canvass the tourists. Unfortunately we got ripped off and paid too much. The going rate is US$20. The guide jumps in your car with you to move from one site to another. At the end he gets a tuk tuk back home. The guide that hooked us claimed to be an archaeologist who had worked on these ruins. He separated us from our private driver so he could puff up a guiding fee from the usual US$20 to US35. We later found out he was going to share the extra money he conned off us with our driver but our driver told him to just charge us the usual US$20 fee instead. Seems our driver had been duped also. We then went to the Statue of Parakramabahu I (Pothgul Vehera statue) which is located on Bund Road to the north of Polonnaruwa, on eastern bank of Parakrama Samudraa reservoir. It is 100 metres north of the ancient Potgul Vehera monastery. This is free to enter so not part of the entry ticket. Next we went to Dalada Maluva  which is the Sacred Quadrangle. This has: - Vatadage Polonnaruwa which is a circular relic house and well preserved - Nissanka Latha Mandapaya that is a pillared structure that is open on all sides - Gal Potha stone inscription is a Stone Book  that is lose between the eastern outer wall of Hetadage and Sathmahal Prasada. Unless you know what it is this stone book could be easily missed even though it is huge. - Hetadage which is sometimes spelt Hatadage is an ancient relic shrine. Note that for some of these ruins you are required to remove shoes but it well sign posted. Next we went to Gal Vihara aka Uttararama which is impressive with various Buddha’s carved in a stone wall made of giant granite. One is a reclining Buddha carved into the side of a rock face. The entry fee is included in the Polonnaruwa Ancient Site entry tickets. Visitors need to cover knees and shoulders and has guards checking this. Next we went to Lankathilaka Image House which is a big standing 17meter high Buddha. Second last was Thivanka Image House that is located on Thivanka Pilimage Road in Nissankamallapura. The fee is included in Polonnaruwa entry ticket. Lastly we went to the Lotus Pond (Polonnaruwa Nelum pokuna) that is located 400 metres south of Thivanka Image House. There is a lot more ruins in all these areas but we tried to see the highlights that intersted us.","November 30, 2023",0.0,0.0

It would be fine if the money was actually used for the ruins and the museum which is NOT the case. Run down museum with old and faded pictures, too many small texts. As usual there are so many official employees (guards, ticket officers) but they all sit around (or sleep even) and do NOT clean up the garbage that is all around (especially at the lake front etc). Also prepare for many annoying people who want to get you to rent a bike which is super overpriced (even the guard tried to persuade us…).

An interesting history where the kingdom was built during Chola Dynasty since invasion from South India to the capital city of Anuradhapura, then Polonnaruwa since 10th century. It is said to be a systematic destruction of Buddhism civilisation from the north in Anuradhapura and built Shiva Temple with Hinduism influence. Polonnaruwa was then established with various significant architecture including more superior water irrigation system that flourished agriculture and trade. Both metropolises were then destroyed and burnt after the war and invasion by Kalinga Magha  (founder of Jaffna Kingdom) in 13th century. There are many remnants of the ruins with intriguing stone carvings. Some of the checklist for places to visit at this site include the below: a. Thivanka Image House** b.

It was a great experience. He drove us between each site and left us to explore the archaeology. It was a really amazing place to explore with each site having old ruined temples which are still considered holy places  and hence no shoes and respectful clothing.. We really enjoyed our time there although it would have been better for us to have gone earlier in the day, as we had to give up on the last temple because it was too hot with our shoes off !... We could see on many of the sites conservation work was going on which was very good , these important historical sites need to be preserved. We saw many people touring on bikes which looked fun and some people were using Tuk-Tuks to travel between the sites...

It consists of a lot of temples and religious buildings. It is UNECSO world heritage site. Before we went into the ruins of the Ancient City, we visited the Archaeological Museum (next to the ticket office). I am recommending this museum for all of tourists, after that no need for a tourist guide in to the Ancient City ( you will recognize all main buildings and tourist sites from the photos and stories in the museum). You can walk, rent a bike or go by car depends of your time and interesting. The enter ticket price is 25$/person and you can pay with US dollars. The best time to visit Polonnaruwa is in the morning, to avoid high temperatures and hot weather. The opening time is 7am-6:30pm daily. We spent more then 4 hours there and we really had a nice time. After touring we took a lunch in The Lake House, which is so nice place for a rest. Built in 1870 as a circuit bungalow for British Government Agents, the Old Polonnaruwa Rest House and once the Queen of England’s holiday destination in the 1960’s, has now been restored and renamed as EKHO Lake House.

Entry is USD 25 for foreigners and USD 12.5 for children (half rate for nationals of SAARC countries). Payment can be made in USD or LKR, but change is returned in LKR only. Paying in USD is every so slightly cheaper when you do the reverse forex rate calculations. Upon paying the entry fee, you can enter the area and see all the various attractions. There is not a lot of information available on-site, so hiring a guide can be worthwhile. There is a museum in the building where you buy tickets, entry to which is complimentary with the Polonnaruwa tickets. However if running short of time, can skip this (which is what we did). Since there are around 26 sites within the premises (all spread apart), it can easily take upwards of 1 whole day to see the place in its entirety and enjoy its beauty. If running short of time, you need to plan in advance and shortlist the places you want to see and first finish those (and then, time permitting see as much of the rest as possible). The Golden Quadrangle, Palace Complex and Gul Vihara are some of the places that i would recommend as must-see. Suggest carrying a lot of water, wearing hats and covering knees. As with most historic ruins, children and people without a sense of history will find this dull, so i would suggest they opt out (instead of paying 25 USD and then realising that they didnt appreciate the beauty of the ruins).","October 19, 2019",0.0,0.0

But I really, really thought it was downright pathetic of them to call their museum a ""museum"", because that's indoors, and it was a literal oven cooking everyone inside alive. We visited the museum prior to actually viewing the ruins, and there, the ventilation is not poor, it's NON-EXISTENT. It's so damn stuffy you have difficulties breathing, and while there are these industrial air-conditioners fixed from the wall, they are not in use at all. Instead, they put fans and those coolers around, expecting these little machines to provide the ventilation and cool air the place actually needs. It was an epic fail. Unless you stood right in front of a cooler, you'd feel like you're burning from inside out, all the time. The moment you step way from a fan or a cooler, the heat literally engulfs you. The museum content is actually quite interesting. The ruins themselves were also impressive. But the ventilation and air-conditioning of the museum is worse than crap.

Note that if you have a driver it is possible to drive to each of the major sites rather than walk through the extensive reserve. There are bikes for hire which would be a great way to take in each site at a leisurely pace when it is a bit cooler. The museum where you buy your ticket is well worth seeing as there are some magnificent artefacts that have been collected from the site. If you plan to go later in the day be aware that some parts of the site require you to remove your shoes. Suggest you have a pair of socks to provide some protection as the ground gets quite hot.,"April 12, 2019",0.0,0.0

I would also say that it is immaterial whether you are a local tourist or an international tourist. I must also say that, over the years the city is becoming increasingly tourist friendly. About 10 years ago when I used visit here there was hardly any decent restaurant or a place to stay. During the last 4-5 years a large number of such places have been built - and more are being commissioned. Road widening and landscaping is still going on (March 2019). In a few years time I would expect a marvelous city here. This is beside the old glory of Polonnaruwa that was always a great tourist attraction. The pick of the sites is Gal Vihara inside the historic city that you can enter by purchasing passes. The majestic Buddha statue in Gal Vihara is an overriding reason for me to visit the place again and again. There are many other monuments inside the historic city that a tourist should not miss. Apart from the historic city one should make it a point to visit the Parakrama Samudra (sea of Parakrama) - a sizeable reservoir built by the king Parakramabahu and later expanded by the first Prime Minister of Sri Lanka, D S Senanayake. It's possible to take a boat ride (no motor boats) in the lake which is highly recommended for the birders and bird photographers. There are a few islands in the lake that are are inhabited by many species of water birds. The bank of the reservoir is a great place to photograph birds flying to and from the islands in the morning and evening. Adjacent to the bank of the lake is the museum - a must visit place. In future, the museum may be relocated in a more spacious modern building in New Town, though. Polonnaruwa is still a city unaffected by the plague of vehicular traffic as do many other cities in Sri Lanka.

I did however see some people who had hired cycles, but it was too hot for me! It was 4525R entrance fee with the ticket office next to the museum, but there wasn’t much to see and the information and presentation was quite dated. Fortunately my driver ordered the sites so I started with the smaller less impressive sites first, followed by the more impressive ones late on, including the 55 metre high red brick Rankot Vihara Dagoba and the quadrangle of Dalada Maluwa which at one point housed the Buddha tooth relic. Remember many of the sites are holy so you need to remove shoes when entering, so bring socks as walking bare foot on the stones gets hot! Also a real “no no” is taking pictures posing with your back to any Buddhas. If you’ve been to some of the major Buddhist archaeological sites like Ankor Wat, Bagan, Borobudur etc. you won’t be blown away, but still this was very enjoyable, and you can easily spend a day seeing the full city.

The other interesting places are the ruins of the King's Council Chamber, the Royal Pavilion, Kiri Vehera and Gal Viharaya. All these places show the high standards of stone craft and artistry of this era. There are 658 villages in the district under seven local government authorities. From the sixth century A.D. onwards Polonnaruwa became increasingly expansion, important  and demographic  in the area is indicated by the construction of shrine rooms, an alternative residence for the Anuradhapura kings and hospitals at Polonnaruwa during the reigns of Silakala (518-31), Aggabodi-III (629- 39),Aggabodhi-IV (667-83) and Udaya-I (793-801) The South Indian Chola empire which conquered the northern part of Sri Lanka in 1017 A.D. established its capital in Polonnaruwa for 53 years until 1070 A.D. After the Cholas were expelled, the Sinhala kings too selected Polonnaruwa as their capital and it flourished for nearly two centuries until 1215 A. D. Once again the South Indian invadle2r1iviaagnhda conquered Polonnaruwa in 1215 with his atrocious rule the Sinhala nobility drifted to the South west and established kingdoms in Dambadeniya and Yapahuwa.","March 4, 2019",0.0,0.0

Sections of it are impressive to say the least and some of it less so. My girlfriend thought parts of it reminded her of Angkor Watt. This is a religious site so make sure you cover shoulders and knees, this isn’t just a suggestion. We saw one lady having a right tantrum when they refused to let her in one of the temples, because she wasn’t dressed appropriately. Even when another member of the public offered to lend her a scarf she carried on screaming at the guards, which had no effect whatsoever. Also make sure you don’t pose for photos with your back to Budda, it’s a big no no. There are monkeys everywhere, so avoid carrying food or drink and they’ll totally ignore you. We saw what happens if you have food and it’s not pleasant. Pollonaruwa Ruins are impressive, intriguing and well worth seeing. It was definitely one of my highlights of our Sri Lanka trip.

On our arrival day we walked round the small site  directly beside Ekho Lake side hotel where we are staying, this appears to be free of charge and was a useful introduction. The next day we bought a ticket from the main ticket centre/Museum and hired a guide. Hiring a Guide 'on-the-street' as it were is always a gamble, the first person who latched on to me appeared to speak OK English, but after asking him a few questions it was apparent that his English was not really much good. The second person who approached me claimed to have been an english language teacher and was much better - but far from perfect. I'm not sure that a guide  you pick up on the street is really worth the hassle. Ours was quite useful in the Museum, but his interest waned during the next few hours and having made enough money from me  was keen to get back to his family for the rest of Poya Day. I thought we had agreed a price, his reccollection was slightly different ( take a piece of paper, write down the agreed price and each kepe a copy!) and when it came to tips, it was OK, then he suggested I also give him something for his lunch, then he spotted that my wife had £'s in her purse and so suggested  £10 towards his air fares fund! So altogether cost about double what I thought we  had agreed - but at the end of the day wasnt really much in European Terms. You would probably be better off with a good guide book and research printed off before you went. The sites are fairly spread out and the entrance is about 2-3Km's from the ticket office. So you need transport (we already had a van and driver for this part of our trip), I guess that visiting all the central sites and then back to the Museum was about 5-10kms, so it's not surprising that the further you travel the less busy the sites become - and actually they are the best parts, Tivanka Image House in particular. Some hire cycles to go round the sites - I would not reccomend it in 30+ degrees unless you are very fit. I would like to have spent more time there but  3-4 hours seemed to be the expectation of the guide and our driver. If I had wanted to visit for even 30 minutes the next day it would have cost another $50 for two of us. Having been to the Angkor Wat archaeological sites the previous year, there is no comparison, Angkor is much larger, much busier, much more interesting but also more expensive, but you can buy 3-day non consecutive tickets.","February 12, 2019",0.0,0.0

Visitors should be prepared for crowds of people, many of whom will ignore well placed and easy to read signs about taking off shoes and not climbing on crumbling walls. There will be people in all of your pictures as well. Ultimately I have two different recommendations re: whether to visit: (1) If you have never seen a similar site I would recommend going - you will be interested the whole way through. (2) If you have been to  multiple other sites as I have, including in Cambodia, throughout Thailand and Burma this is ok to skip.

Most people seem to cycle around the ruins and I could see why this would be attractive - it's cheap, easy and safe, and you can move between the different sites fairly quickly.  However, we were advised by a local to head to the top of the site by tuktuk then walk back to town, and I'd highly recommend this approach too - you'll get to see a lot more wildlife when you're walking, and trust me there's a lot to see if you keep your eyes open!  Saying that, you'll probably be fairly tired by the end, and make sure you take plenty of water.  The ruins comprise of a number of main sites interspersed by smaller, less-visited sites.  Be prepared for crowds at the main sites, with far fewer tourists at the smaller ones.  All are worth a visit though.  OK, this is not Angkor or Bagan, so don't expect it to be - I've been to both those and still reckon this is worth a visit if you're up in the cultural triangle.

Having done Bagan, Angkor, and Ayutthaya, I found Polonnaruwa downright boring. Granted, I'm jaded at this point, but I can't recall anything at this site that I hadn't seen elsewhere--other than the big temple that is positively *vibrating* with a bat colony in its hollows. The site also has that Angkor-esque picture taking issue, where the entire grounds tends to be distilled down to only a few scenic venues when people are showing off this place in pictures. I.e. if you're thinking of going based on a well-balanced shot of a seated Buddha surrounded by broken columns, be aware that you're not going to enter a site replete with similar ruins: you're seeing a picture of the only kneeling Buddha at Polonnaruwa surround by broken columns, and any pictures you get are going to exactly resemble the postcard that pulled you to Polonnaruwa in the first place, leaving one to wonder exactly how unique an experience it actually it to visit Polonnaruwa at all.","January 10, 2019",0.0,0.0

There is ample parking and good visitor facilities (toilets, wash facilities, food and drink) We travelled around by car, which was straightforward enough.  There are several services hiring out push bikes, which seemed a pleasant way of getting around. We had a very informative guide book, which we used to navigate and inform our route round.  There are some information boards dotted around, but they don't give particularly detailed descriptions.  As with any historic site visit, there are several 'guides' hanging around offering their services, if you are without a guidebook and find a good guide I would recommend it as you will miss out on a lot of information and even miss some of the well hidden sites altogether!

The tickets are a bit pricey, 4000 rupees per person (aprox 25 US$ per person). Where the ticket office is, is also the small museum where you can read about the site. Dont forget to take a map from the ticket office (it is free)! No way of getting around otherwise. It is a huge place, and my advice is to hire a tuk tuk to drive you around from one ruin to another. I think it is the best way to explore this amazing ancient site! We hired a tuktuk from Sigiriya to take us to Polonnaruwa and around Polonnaruwa. It took us 1:45 minutes to get there from Sigiriya, and we spent another 2-3 hours exploring the ruins of the site (with a tuktuk, walking would take us the whole day). That half a day trip with a tuktuk cost us 5000 rupees. (Use your bargaining skills) I saw you can hire a bike to explore around the ruins, but considering the sun above us, not the best option (if you want this option, take some hats and sun protection) Most places there you will have to take you shoes off, so if your feet cannot handle heat, bring socks with you! The sand and the stone can get really hot. Also, like all buddhist holy places, keep you shoulders covered and wear longer pants. There are a lot of vendors there where you can buy cold drinks, but a bit exspensive. I think it is a nice trip for families, couples, friends - everyone. You can buy nice suvenirs there like wooden elephants and Buddhas. But remember, always bargain! We bought a small wooden carved elephant- the original price was 4500 rupees, and we bought it for 1000 rupees.

There is a lot of walking at each of the sites anyway, but it is so spread out that it is not possible to see everything, and even with the bicycles available for hire it would be exhausting just getting between the various ruins. Make a priority list of what you want to see as you can’t do it all. There is very little information available at each of the ruins, so take a guidebook or print out information from the internet before you go. Make sure to wear clothes that cover the shoulders and knees or you won’t be allowed to enter some parts. Wear shoes that are easy to get on and off as you will need to do that continuously. Take old socks to wear as the rocks can be very hot. Use plenty of sunscreen and take a hat and water as it can be very hot indeed. Enjoy - an amazing place.","August 2, 2018",0.0,0.0

From the main street of Dambulla, there are regular buses heading towards Kaduruwela – which is an adjacent part of Polonnaruwa where the train and bus stations are located. Hopping onto any bus that is heading to Kaduruwela will get you into Polonnaruwa. However, it is best to tell the bus conductor to drop you off in the “Old Town”, which is (I think) the first main drop-off as you enter Polonnaruwa (from the direction of Dambulla). The bus journey took about 90 – 100 minutes, and cost 100 rupees. After getting off the bus in the Old Town, ask around to get to the Museum -- just short walk away along a canal -- where you can buy a combined ticket for the museum and the archaeological sights. It cost 3975 rupees but is valid only for one day. The museum gives a so-so introduction to the history of the Sri Lankan kingdoms, putting the ruins of Polonnaruwa into a larger context. Curation has room for improvement. Moreover, the airconditioning was weak and it was warm and humid inside the place. The ticket comes with a pretty useless map. The staff know that the map is useless. So the lady advised me to take a photo of the wall-mounted map which gives clearer directions of where the ruins are situated. What's so difficult about designing and printing a new map? The fact that no one has yet done so gives you a clue about shoddy management standards. From the museum’s exit, walk northwest through a small garden to the group of ruins on the shore of the lake known as Parakramabahu Samudera. Then walk east and cross the main road, to the entrance to the other section of the ruins. Your ticket will be checked again. The ruins are in three main clusters: the lakeshore cluster (also known as the ‘island’ group), the royal palace cluster and the quadrangle cluster, each about 500m from each other. But there are plenty more sites scattered a few kilometres around. Some ruins are in bad shape; the ones in the sacred quadrangle are perhaps in the best condition. It wasn’t possible to cover much more than the three main clusters in the time (a daytrip) that I had. Based on my experience, I’d say that if you want to examine most of the ruins, I think you will need a much earlier start, which means staying in Polonnaruwa the night before and the night after. I am rating his site as merely ""average"". Even allowing for the fact that ruins that are 800 - 1100 years old can't possibly be in good condition, when I compare it with other archaeological sites of similar vintage around the world, Polonnaruwa is not outstanding. The stone construction does not look to have been built to a high standard; the sculpture works were relatively few and not particularly good aesthetically. The fundamental reason, I suppose, is that the kingdom over which Polonnaruwa controlled was probably a smallish one (by world standards) and it might never have had the resources to build a truly great capital city. As a second-class city, today we have second-class ruins. Add to that sub-par management, lack of cafes and toilets in the sites despite the heat and great distances... and my feeling at the end of the day was a degree of dissatisfaction.","May 25, 2018",0.0,0.0

We saw people riding bicycles (in hot weather!) however we went by car so if you are doing this by bike it will take longer. Make sure you use a Saron to cover up to your knees and ideally flip flops as in some temples you are requested to remove your shoes. Ladies may be requested to bring an scarf to cover their shoulders. The place is full of history and the guide takes you into that journey as he walks you through the different locations. He reminds you of some of the important learning you take from the museum visit.

However when we did this we were told off and made to delete the photos - our guide did not understand this and spoke to the man who made us delete the photos at some length and told us that this had never been an issue before - however, best advice is do not have any people in your photos wherever they are standing!!

As the conversation continued, she put her hand and the notes back in the drawer. Chat over, there was a pause.""You have to give me more money,"" I said. She pulled her hand out of the drawer, counted out some LKR 100 bills and pushed them over. I picked them up. There were nine. ""One more please"", I said. She peeled one more off and laid it down.

Polonnurawa is certainly worth a visit. There is really a lot of history here. We came with a tour guide so we got the low down on the history. Again expect to pay for the admission which is around 3500 LKR ( pls check before going ) each.  This is about the same price as for Anuradhaphura . The majority of the  entrance fees go towards maintaining the site and further excavations, so you are funding a good cause.  After paying for the admission do go round the museum which is where you get the admission tickets.   The visit to the museum is worthwhile especially if you don’t have a guide. It explains each monument and the history behind it.  And also the history as to why the Kings moved from   Anuradhaphura to Polonnurawa to start a second kingdom. All the places are concentrated in one small area so walking from one to another is quite straightforward. Polonnurawa  started in the 10th Century as the capital city  and ended around the 12th Century . Apparently it had lain undiscovered until British archeologists began probing in the late 19th century when the whole area was covered in forests.  When you look at the buildings do look at the surrounding trees. Their bases are about 1.5 m to 2 m above the ground of the excavations. It will have taken some serious excavations to get to the monuments. Some places are just spectacular.  The Royal palace for one, the second is the lake or a ‘tank’ as they call it.  This huge lake of 25 sq km was manually excavated in the 12th century by people and elephants.  It really is quite an awesome task. There are some temples which are in ruins and previously held the Scared Relic of the Tooth ( now housed in Kandy).  Just do note that the dress code applies to temple ruins as to living temples. No shorts, or crop tops and no slippers on the temple grounds ( even abandoned ones).  A few visitors were caught out and not allowed in. Having visited both Polonnurawa and Anuradhaphura I think if you don’t have enough time then Polonnurawa is the better choice.

The Cholas lasted until 1070 when the Sinhalese King Vijayabahu drove them out of the island. Vijayabahu retained Polonnaruwa as his capital as did successive kings until the late 13th century. But Polonnaruwa proved difficult to defend against invaders from India and the Sinhalese kingdom moved across to the west coast and Polonnaruwa was allowed to decay. By the late 13th century Ceylon had 2 ancient abandoned capitals although, as ruins, there is still much to see. Anuradhapura is the more extensive and the more important as a religious site for Buddhist pilgrims, whereas Polonnaruwa, the more recent, is in better condition and compact, is considered more important for its archaeology, art, architecture, engineering and agriculture. The ruins of Polonnaruwa are very impressive, demonstrating a remarkable standard of scale, design and construction and, in particular, the detail. There are more than 30 significant buildings and statues here, mostly enclosed within the ancient walls and overlooking the enormous hand dug 2,500 ha Parakrama Samudraya tank as directed by King Parakramabahu I. There are also irrigation tanks and waterways that supplied the gardens and fields. It is believed that King Parakramabahu fully understood the importance of irrigation and is said to have declared that ‘not even a drop of water that comes from the rain must flow into the ocean, without being made useful to man’. On the site is the ticket counter, information centre, small museum, air conditioned auditorium and a small bookshop. But it is the ruined buildings and statues that visitors come to see and a good way to explore those is by hired bicycle. However the vast site is so complex that to best understand it, you would need a guide. Our little party had our own transport and recruited an official guide to show us the sights and provide an informative running commentary. There are both official guides (those with badges) and un-official ones. Our guide was well informed and we felt the cost of R 3,000 was justified.

The history and art/architecture here really are beautiful. Go to the museum (where you buy your tickets) before hand and bring your guidebook, as the signs at the various sites provide only the names of buildings. The major sites are grouped into several areas, each one separated by a few kilometers. From the southern most area with the king's statue to the Gal Viharaya in the north, for example, it is around 5km. Each area in and of itself is also fairly large. All this say--you are going to walk. A lot. As we did it with two very young children, we used a driver to shuttle between the sites, which I'd recommend. Bicycle would also be excellent; there are lots of places along the main road into the complex that will rent. While there are few shady places here and there, most of the sites are very exposed, so also be prepared for a lot of sun (though there are many gentlemen who'd be very willing to sell you a hat if you forgot one). Additionally, as you will be in and out of Buddhist temples, I'd suggest wearing socks, as the stones get very, very hot.","April 15, 2018",0.0,0.0

We had guide with us. The advantage of a guide is that they can help you make the most of your visit by selecting out what to see and more importantly they have the knowledge of what is inter-connected and in close proximity too. This is massive heritage site and you cannot explore all of it in one day so selecting out points of interest and finding them is a challenge. Best to read up about it before you arrive as that may help you select out what you think suits you best. Alternatively just meander and explore. There is an option to hire cycles and that could be a good way to explore the site. Whether walking or cycling or with a driver guide you will almost certainly come across structures which will amaze you. The architecture is a delight if you have not previously seen buddhist or hindu heritage sites before. One of the joys was seeing carved granite carvings in the structures which convey stories. Hindu architecture is very different from Buddhist architecture. One revers the Buddha without much reference to the animal kingdom and the other is prolific in carving animals, 'grotesque' masks and moonstones with story telling symbolisms threaded throughout the buildings and statues. One is also relatively simplistic in design while the  other is over complicated, yet they are in harmony too. So this a site where you can marvel at the size and shapes of early structures, whether they be structures like a giant wedding cake or stupa's which are round and dome like. Another joy of visiting this place is the sense of freedom you have to explore it. However there is an obligation that visitors show extra respect for those sites with a special religious significance. This presents no problems if your address is appropriate i.e. no knees (men and women) showing and the female head is covered. However this applies only to certain special places here not all of them. This is also a site that has grass and avenues of trees to contrast with the massive  brick structures. Until I visited this place I never realised that bricks were being made in the 12 century and were being used to build multi storey buildings and places of worship. If you are not keen on heritage ruins and history you will probable not rate these sites very much. For me it was interesting, enjoyable, varied and wonderful because of it heritage. I have not previously seen a nothing quite like it on this scale despite travelling to over 20 countries.","April 3, 2018",0.0,0.0

You can also get a tuk tuk around it. The royal palace group, quadrangle group and northern group are the main ones you'll visit.

There are several temples, where shoes have to be removed to enter - a bit of a problem on very hot days, so socks are recommended.  The buildings are quite spaced out so a car is useful.  Tickets are obtainable from the museum further down the main road.","March 22, 2018",0.0,0.0

Entry is not cheap -  25$ per person – but it is an impressive site, with well-preserved monuments and good landscaping.  It is a generally peaceful site, with a prevailing air of calm and respect.  The one exception was the completely inappropriate loud music blaring from the refreshments area half way round.  We spent around four hours there which enabled us to visit all the temples and monuments.  We spent a further 30 mins in the museum adjoining the ticket office. Practicalities: Polonnarawu covers a large area, so walking the whole site, which covers a large area, might be a challenge - particularly in the 30 degrees heat.  We had hired a driver for the day so he came with us into the site (entry is free for locals) and dropped us off at each of the main areas to wander around at leisure – the car a/c in between stops was very welcome!  Another option is to hire a bike outside the site, which a number of people did ( depending on where you hire bikes from the downside is that you may have to cycle for a stretch on the main road – contending with all the usual crazy Sri Lankan traffic- either at the start of the tour or end).   Socks are recommended when entering the temples as it can be very hot underfoot.  About half way round there are toilets – those for foreigners were clean & in a reasonably good condition.  There were also the aforementioned refreshment stalls.   There are similar facilities (albeit less clean toilets) just before the exit.","March 22, 2018",0.0,0.0

The place is large, but it is easy to walk the ground to the various sights that are all open to the public.  In some one must remove shoes.  I would suggest that one reads up about this site in advance since there is a lot to absorb.  Also you would be well prepared to ask questions to your guide as you go from one to another.","March 22, 2018",0.0,0.0
