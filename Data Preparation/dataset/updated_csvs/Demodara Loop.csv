We went there to see the famous 'spiral loop' at Demodera.  The train coming from the up-country enters the tunnel located right under the station.  Though at different levels, the tunnel is almost perpendicular to the station.  It then traverses around the adjoining hill in an upward spiral coming up to the station and proceeds towards Ella.  We observed the train passing along, after it emanated from the tunnel.  When it arrived at the station we got in and travelled down to Ella. The legend has it that, during railway construction, engineers had been perplexed to find a means of bridging the considerable vertical level difference between two adjoining hills. A person tying his turban around his head is said to have implanted the idea of the loop to bridge this gap by circumscribing the hill. Demodera loop is 1049 feet feet long at a gradient of 1 in 44, the maximum allowable in Sri Lanka Railway construction. The quaint Demodera railway station reminded me of the time when I travelled to school by train.  The trains in this section of the railway still rely on exchanging tablets on arrival.  The ticket holding cupboard and even the appearance of the clock in the station master's room have remained unchanged from the 1950s. On the way back from Ella we passed over the 'Nine Arch Bridge', where there were many tourists waiting to see it pass by.","August 15, 2019",0.0,0.0

It was an interesting solution to an almost unique engineering challenge in the railway line by the British’s. It is certainly worth taking this train ride and when you get to go under the station you have just stopped at!  Ride in 3rd class and watch the world go by while standing in the door! The cost is Rs 10 per person one way on the train from Ella to Demodera. This is just another amazing and marvelous piece of work. It is a great engineering marvel getting a train to rise-up in elevation on a mountain. You can go all the way to tunnel as well getting a nice experience. We caught the train to Demodara at 3:30pm from Ella. We got a fabulous 25 minute train trip over the bridge and through some tunnels; you see the loop at the Demodara station where the train goes around in a circle to descend 10 metres or so. Tuk tuk back to Ella was also a nice trip. Views from the train are stunning and well worth the effort. Local station will be able to advise of the scheduled train times and also if you download  “Trains - Sri Lanka” App. If you get into a train coming from Badulla, it won’t be late but the one in opposite direction. It would be late as  the trains commence from Colombo far away and mostly delays occur to giving way to the other train on opposite direction at stations as the railway line from Rabukkana onwards is single lined on the hills. What a view we got. The train came  just 10 mins after we reach the station to take a glimpse and we saw road going upwards from the rail track. The train loops back and runs directly under the station! You can 'walk' the loop as well. If you want a bird's eye view you can go to Ooduwaare Estate where you can see the train loop round the hill and come back. For you to appreciate the loop better, get the tuk tuk driver and tell him to first take you down near the tunnel. And then you go back up to the Demodara railway station to watch the train leaving the tunnel from above. Can see a nice view  from the Demodara train station.  Once you get down from the train at Demodara station quickly run Out if the station to watch the train turn and come out of the tunnel going towards Badulla if you come on a Badulla bound train. The interesting thing behind this Demodara loop is taking a small train trip to cover the activity from Ella. It is a great thing to do with kids mainly and for adults too. It is definitely worth the sceneries even if you aren't a fan of trains!  I recommend you take the train journey to cover the Demodera Loop.","June 18, 2018",0.0,0.0

If you prefer to travel along the loop, note that when proceeding towards Badulla, the loop is just AFTER the Demodara station. I prefer to walk the entire loop. For this, the best way is to get down at Demodara railway station, view the historical details of the loop and its construction, displayed at the station, and then walk along the railway line.  Be sure to ascertain the train times beforehand, since you will need to walk through a tunnel. The railway is single-line, and this obviously means that when a train goes in one direction, another cannot come from the opposite direction for some time.

The railway loops and goes under itself. You can view this from the Demodara Railway station (walk few meters from the platform). What you see is the railway going under where you're standing on. You actually can't see the whole loop together unless viewed from a helicopter. We did this excursion by boarding the Colombo to Badulla ""Podi Menike"" train at Diyatalawa Station at 3:30pm (as we were staying at Diyatalawa). You can board this train at Ella as well. If you're going directly to Demodara station to view this, please check train times to see at what times trains arrive/depart as this is not a line with a lot of trains. We got off at Demodara, and walked few meters where you can see the Railway underneath where it goes underneatch after the negotiating the loop. You see the same train that you arrived going underneath. After this, we walked down to the railway (easy walk downhill), and walked along to the bridge nearby. Then we walked along the Railway tunnel (this is the tunnerl under the Demodara station) and climbed up from the other side of the hill (somewhat steep but short climb). Tips: If you're coming here on board a Train, the Nine Arches Bridge is between Ella and Demodara Stations. Get on board a Badulla bound train at Ella (or prior to Ella) and you will be riding on the Nine Arches Bridge. Train ride is interesting specially for the kids. Take precaution but it's very interesting to ride by sitting on the steps at the doors. You see people from all walks of life on this train, and odd snack sellers selling delicious deviled prawns on the train. Several small vegetable gardens on the side of the railway, and several rail crossings. In the station you get onboard, be sure to check out the tablet exchange between the Train driver and the Station employee. This is the ""permission"" note for the train to proceed to the next station (as this is single line track). After viewing the Demodara loop, you can probably walk along the Railway back towards Ella and reach Nine Arches Bridge. We want to Nine Arches Bridge by Vehicles so I don't know how easy or difficult the walk along the railway is towards Nine Arches. See my review of Nine Arches Bridge separately. Tip: If planning to see both Demodara Loop and go to Nine Arches, I recommend following, - Use Badulla bound ""Podi Menike"" train to go to Demodara (reaches Demodara at around 4+pm). - See the Demodara Loop, and find your way to Nine Archers (either walk or via vehicles). - You can then see next Badulla bound train ""Udarata Menike"" at Nine Arches at around 5:30pm.","April 12, 2017",0.0,0.0
