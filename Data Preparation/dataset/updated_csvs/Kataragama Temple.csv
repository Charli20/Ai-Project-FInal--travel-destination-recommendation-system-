This sacred site is unlike any other — a rare place where multiple faiths come together in harmony. Buddhists, Hindus, and even local Muslims and Veddas all revere this place, and you can feel that deep spiritual energy the moment you enter. The daily rituals, rhythmic drumming, incense, and devotion of the pilgrims create a truly immersive experience. Watching devotees carry kavadi offerings or bathe in the Menik Ganga was humbling and beautiful. The temple grounds are expansive yet peaceful, especially early in the morning or just before dusk. Even as a non-religious visitor, I felt welcomed and deeply moved. The blend of nature, tradition, and raw human faith here is hard to put into words — it’s something you feel. Yes, there are vendors and crowds during festivals, but that’s part of the living culture. Come with respect, dress modestly, and don’t rush. Let the place speak to you.","September 25, 2025",0.0,0.0

Kataragama is a multi religious sacred city for Buddhists, Tamils, and the Muslims. Its a sacred city for anyone to visit, with Buddhist temples, Hindu Temples, and a Mosque. Many pilgrims visit Kataragama to offer their rituals, and grant their gratitude to any gods they promised an offering of flowers, gifts or any other vows they have made to offer the gods. Many pilgrims visit Kataragama around the year, but many visit in July/August. Its in August that the Kataragama Perehera or the festival is a possession of Elephants, Dancers, Whip Crackers and many more attractions are found during this possession. If you want to pay your rituals what you have kept, its better to prepare your flower baskets, fruit tray from home. So that they are fresh and not damaged or crushed. If you want to buy flowers or fruits at the entrance from the stalls outside you will be cheated or you will end up paying more than expected. Not like those days, now its all business, these scammers will scrape all your money with rotten fruits, beautifully arranged, so you need to be careful, and eating around you should find the correct place to eat and drink. As you make get allergies, its better to have mineral water through out the day. If you are to visit the temples, kovils, or the mosque, the best time will  be early morning around 5 am, or in the late evening after 5 pm, as you wont feel the hot climate. If you are looking for a comfortable place to stay, there are many guest houses, hotels, or houses that rent out rooms. If you can find a place close by to the Kataragama sacred area, it will be convenient.  You need not worry looking for parking spaces, just walk it out you will be fresh and comfortable. The room prices are reasonable during the off season, and no need to worry about the crowd. During the months of June and August you will need to book your room in advance. If you re to book online, search and find the correct place, as you will not end up paying extra. Travelling to Kataragama, you can travel by your own car, hired vehicles, or take the local transport (bus). You can take the Colombo - Kataragama route, Nuwara  Eliya - Kataragama route, Badulla - Kataragama - route. If you are planning to take the Buttala road, there are some precautions you need to take. The Tissamaharama road is safe, but the Buttala road you have to drive carefully, on the way you will cross the Yala forest area, and there are elephants on the road in three or four places. They stand by the road side to get fruits from the travelers passing by. So travelers usually take fruits, (bananas, mangos, pineapples to feed them in case they come across one. Usually they can be seen in the morning hours, afternoon, or in the evenings.  They will not attack or disturb you, unless you don't disturb them. But, recently they were some incidents, where the elephants had attacked some vehicles, and damaged. There were some foreign tourists who were attacked by the elephants and damaged the vehicle they had hired. The wild life authorities were at the area to find out the reason for the attack. They found out that some you tubers/ scammers had aroused the elephants to attack the passing vehicles. When the elephants attack we leave out vehicles, valuables and flee for safety. At this moment the scammers/ you tubers take the opportunity to record the incident as a natural attack and post it on their youtube accounts, and the valuable that are left in the cars or left on the road are robbed. (Its was a news flash on the TV channels in SriLanka two weeks back). Now they say the wild life has put a stop and controlled the situation. What ever it is, its better to be cautious and be safe. If you ever see a biker with a phone on the Buttala road, that means there is an elephant ahead on the road, and is on a wage to attack. Don't get closer or pass the biker, just stop for a moment, if the area is clear, then proceed. This is a note for your safety. Drive safe, be cautious and enjoy the trip. Hope you have a safe journey. See you soon. ""Flavorful Destinations"" By:- M N Nizam","February 10, 2025",0.0,0.0

Just being there was an experience hard to put into words.  Ringing the bells till my heart content as if personally speaking with HIM, entertaining HIM, watching HIM smile back at me...ohhhh..what can I say?

The most important in this temple complex is the main shrine dedicated to the guardian deity with six faces and twelwe arms sitting on a peacock, the “Katharagama Deviyo” also venerated by Hindus as “Murugan or Skanda”.  This main shrine attracts Buddhist as well as Hindu pilgrims from all over Sri Lanka and from as far as South India. As we had adequate time before the pooja (offering) scheduled for 1900 hrs, we walked around the temple complex visiting the other subordinate shrines dedicated to deities Vishnu, Ganesha, Dedimunda, Paththini, Kali, Suniyam and Sumana Saman.  The bo tree behind the main Katharagama shrine is said to be a sapling from the Anuradhapura bodhi tree planted in 3rd Century BCE.  We could walk around leisurely and amongst the seated devotees since it was a weekday and not not so crowded.  Weekends and full-moon days see throngs of people visiting the temple. Some of us, carrying our offerings of fruits in a tray, joined the queue with other devotees.  The queue at the left was for those with tray offerings and the one on the right for others.  Those with tray offerings keep clearly visible monetary offerings on top of the fruit tray demonstrating their piety and seeking divine intervention into or from whatever problems they may have.  Others seek fulfilment of their wishes and aspirations.  After the main official pooja, these trays are accepted by the priests chanting prayers interceding for devotees, part emptied and returned to the owners.  At the exit, you may opt to have a dot placed on your forehead signifying obeisance and reverence. Unlike at other temples, the main shrine is a simple two roomed structure, not at all grand.  The other surrounding shrines too are in simple one roomed buildings, some built from stone.  I understand that they had not been altered since they were built as people are reluctant to carry out modifications.  Furthermore, in all these shrine rooms, the deities are not represented by large statues, but by large drawings portraying their glory and power.  Within the main shrine, in addition to the main drawing facing the entrance are few others on side walls too depicting the power of Katharagama deity.  With the sounding of many bells at this sacred place, coupled with the chanting, the aura of the Katharagama guardian deity descended on me, overwhelming me, when within the shrine.  The feelings each of us experience may of course vary depending on our beliefs and the environment. Almost as one enters through main entrance is the coconut breaking area situated right in front of the main Katharagama Devala.  Devotees hold the coconut with both hands raised, make a prayer or a wish, and dash it on the stone basin, breaking it into pieces and spilling its water.  They believe that this helps their wish and prayer to come true.  Some do wish ill-will to their enemies when shattering the coconut. After exiting the temple through the main southern entrance around 8.00 pm, we walked along the road leading to and across the Menik river.  We observed people bathing in the river even at this late hour.  There is a saying among the locals that if you bathe in this river all your sins get washed away!!","February 26, 2019",0.0,0.0

The main Kovil is called Devalaya, The presiding deity is Lord Kathikeya ( also called Murugan ). Unlike other kovils there is only a screen on which the image of the Lord is painted. The screen is always on. Enquiry with the personnel who asissts in the daily pooja revealed that what is behind is a secret and the screen in not opened any time.

After about 10 minutes the only English speaking attendent informed us that the curtain is NEVER opened to public at any time! He said it is not opened even for the President of Sri Lanka!!!!! It will be interesting to understand why this is so as I do not recall ever coming across a place of worship where the inner sanctum is never opened.

Our Driver/Guide found place in front of stall outside of the complex, where we purchased a plate of offering in the form of fruit for the Hindu Temple. Then as we were walking to the temple entrance, we witnessed many people bathing in a very dirty river before entering the temple. Along the long path to the temple complex there are stalls selling fruit, flowers and incense. There are large groups of black-faced monkeys on all of the trees waiting for the fruit to be given to them after the temple blessing. As usual, there are many starving dogs, some with extremely bad skin conditions roaming the path or the temple complex. Also, there are quite a few beggar families who send their children to beg from the devotees. There are three places of worship at this complex, with the Hindu Temple being the main focus and then the Buddhist Temple and finally the Mosque. Many people visit both the Hindu Temple and the Buddhist Temple and give offerings. We purchased a plate of fruit as offering and proceeded to wait in line for at least for at least one-hour for the temple to open. While we were waiting, we witnessed two different processions to the temple with music and dancing. Once the temple opened the process of getting the blessing and walking out with your blessed fruit was a little chaotic. Then, as we had purchased and brought with us dog food for the stray starving dogs, we proceeded to feed the hungriest dogs with our food. Then we walked the path to the Buddhist Temple, feeding some of the monkeys our blessed fruit by leaving it on tree branches. At the Buddhist Temple, we witnessed people being provided food in a large hall. The saddest thing we witnessed was the Temple Elephant. OMG! They had the Temple Elephant tied to a fence with absolutely no room for it to move, so that it was forced to endure standing in the heat, in its own excrement, while people paid money to walk under its belly. Apparently these STUPID people believe that by walking under the belly of a Temple Elephant, they are absolved of all of their sins. Why is this abomination still allowed to happen in Sri Lanka and especially in a Buddhist Temple? Please people of Sri Lanka – you can stop this continuing. I saw the Elephant continuously shedding tears while I was there watching this madness going on. I pointed the tears out to the Mahout, who just brushed it aside saying it is normal behaviour. I really wish that my review will bring to light the plight of this Temple Elephant and the Sri Lankan people themselves will choose to stop this form of exploitation of this Elephant from continuing.","January 23, 2017",0.0,0.0

Among those places I would like to provide a description about Kataragama Devalaya (where the worship place for God Kataragama) with this review. It was my third visit to this sacred place. There were more people at the place, may be due to the long weekend for the public sector employees. The area was very dry since this is not the rainy season there. Anyway I believe it is better to visit this place after 6.00 pm to avoid the uncomfortable due to warm sun light. The history of this place goes to the era of King Dutugemunu who ruled the country during the period of 161 BC - 137 BC. According to the history the tusks of his royal tusker, ""Kandula"" are also placed at this location. But those are not exhibit for the general public. There are many people in the island who keep the trust on god Kataragama. This place considered as one of the main worship place for that god. Therefore many people irrespective of their religion visit this devala with the expectation of the blessing of god Kataragama. The other well known worship placed for god Kataragama are, ""Sellakataragama"" and ""Kebiliththa"". It is better of you can avoid week ends to visit there, if you need to avoid the crowd.","September 11, 2016",0.0,0.0

Starting from the town itself, there are stalls selling all manner of religious paraphernalia. You walk across a river, with people bathing in it on hot days. You pass a mobile phone tower disguised (badly) as a tree. Finally you get to the temple precinct. The area is large, with a massive bodhi tree set behind the central core. The central core is where most of the action was when we were there. Regrettably, even at 10am, that means doing the hot bare foot shuffle or running from one scant shade to the next - This was the trying bit. We also checked out the museum on the grounds.

Many lined up to offer the fruit for blessings in the main temple, directly opposite where you enter. There are also smaller areas just in side the gate where other prayers and offerings a made. While we were visiting there was a group of devotees that played trumpets and drums as they danced around all the smaller  temples in the complex, ending up at the main one directly near the entrance of the gate. This was particularly exciting. While we sat on the edge of the walled complex and people watched, many people offered us fruit from the platers they had brought to the temple. Their generosity was humbling and made us feel very welcome despite being foreigners in a local place of worship.

Buddhists believe, it is one of the eighteen places Gautama Buddha visited in one of his three visits to the island. Hindus and Muslims believe it is the place where Lord Skanda / Prophet Khdir lived. Therefore visiting the Hindu shrines and the mosque is a must but without forgetting the nearby “ Kiri Vehera “ where it is believed to containing one of the relics of Lord Buddha thus highly revered. Religious rituals are performed daily once in the Morning and once in the evening at the Hindu shrine which is a bit lengthy for a casual visitor.

Also be cautious of  conmen as there are lots of them around, even though its a religious place.","August 15, 2015",0.0,0.0

Pure Buddhists would not believe in Gods, but since Sri Lanka is influenced by a lot of Hindu Customs and Rituals, people show great reverence to God Kataragama. Buddhists would usually visit the Kirivehera to pay their respects to the Buddha first, before walking down the sandy road to the Katharamaga Kovil. Many people still bath at the Menik Ganga (River) and wear white and desist from eating meat/ consuming alcohol prior to entering the sacred compound. Folklore: Katharagama God came in the guise of an old man and asked the first person he met (who happened to be a Tamil) to build him a house. This person assessed the old man, and asked him why he should waste time building a house for an old man who will die soon.The next person he met (who happened to be a Sinhalese) was asked the same question. The Sinhalese man agreed to build the old man a house. This is the reason for rituals in the kovil to be performed by only Sinhalese people, whereas kovils of other Gods have Tamil Poosaris. People also believe that Tamils need to show penance and perform various activities such as rolling bare bodied on the sad, piercing their mouths, piercing their skin and hanging themselves from a rope etc. The logs we see above the entrance to the kovil is said to be the same wood used to make the original house of Katharagama God. The location of the house was marked by the God by shooting an arrow from Vadihiti Kanda. The Bo tree behind the Kataragama temple is one of the eight saplings of the Sri Maha Bodhiya in Anuradapura. The best time to visit is early morning (I think the pooja is at 4.30am). The sand and the air are cool and there is much less crowd. Prepare for large crowds during weekends/ holidays.

Tip we'd had from our driver on any day we were visiting temples was to wear socks, and one of us had forgotten completely, the other had thin ones on.  There are a lot of stalls selling things on the way in for offerings and so forth, and one of them should stock socks for unwary tourists!  There's a walk in and then you reach the hut where you leave your shoes and hats - it's quite a way from there across hot sandy grit to the actual temples and it was seriously burning that day.  Some visitors must have been laughing at the antics trying to touch down as little as possible.  It's a bit different, in that there are multiple temples and a sacred bo tree and various things going on all at once.  Apparently it's a regular place of pilgrimage and where a lot of Sri Lankans bring their new cars for their first outing and hang copies of the registration plates on tree to ensure safe and trouble free driving - understandable when you see the traffic in Colombo!  In one Hindu temple our foreheads were marked and we went around a few closer by, before the feet got too sore and I stayed in the shade of the bo tree watching a couple with two youngsters making their offerings there, circling the tree with pots of water, while husband and driver went to the farthest temple.  By the time they returned there were a group of people dancing in front of the first temple, which we stayed to watch, before leaping as fast as possible back across the sand to the shoe hut.

Yala borders the Indian ocean. Kataragama is mainly venerated by Buddhists and Hindus as both pay homage to the Deity Lord Skanda ( Kataramama Deviyo/ God Kataragama). There are  two places of veneration in Kataragama - the Maha Devale of  Lord Skanda and the Kiri Vehera.   Buddhists first worship Kiri Vehera, a dagoba of great magnitude and serenity to offer flowers, light lamps, incense, then prey and meditate and thereafter proceed to Kataragama Maha Devale / Kovil on a walkway that joins the two places of worship. Kataragama Maha viharaya is visited by all religions in Sri Lanka, Buddhist, Hindu, Christian, Muslim etc, during the pooja times, when beels are rung incense is lit, invocations are made and alms specially prepared by devotees on a 365 day roster are brought amidst ceremony.

We visited for the evening puja - I would not recommend visiting outside the main worship times, as much of what there was to see was people watching. We parked in the commercial area (with stalls selling fruit and flowers) and walked across the bridge to the temples. First impressions were that Kataragama is a dirty town - there is a lot more rubbish around than we saw in the rest of Sri Lanka. But after dark one can ignore that. There are some old columns by the Buddhist stupa which apparently date from a much earlier temple on the site. In the Hindu temple worshipers were queuing to have fruit blessed. We were interested to see that after being blessed many were eating the fruit. I'm not sure if this is true, but our guide said that the priests working in the Hindu temple were not actually monks - but were 'normal' people. If this is the case then one would wonder what the value of the blessing is to the worshipers. Once again, like at the Temple of the Tooth in Kandy - the commercialisation of religion made me somewhat uncomfortable.","December 12, 2012",0.0,0.0

After a short nap in a nearby hotel, i.e. Weerasir Hotel, I proceeded to the main Murugan Temple complex there, i.e. Maha Devale which is dedicated to Skanda-Murugan known amongst the Sinhalese as Kataragama deviyo. This shrine contains the lance of the six-faced, 12-armed Hindu war god, Murugan. In the main Devale, there r 2 appartments which is accessed through 7 veils/curtains. After a quick prayer and a short stop at the Puja Stalls outside the temple complex to buy souveniers, I headed to the nearby Kataragama Bus station.","November 22, 2012",0.0,0.0

It is a relegious place for all races of sinhalese, tamils. muslims, burger and english. The place is always crowded during weekends and weekdays are better. And the morning and evening poojawa is at 6 and 6 pm for the god of kataragama at the devalaya. You would need to join the queve before hand with the treat to the god where you can buy them. Once the Poojawa is done everybody is served with tasty treat. I have eaten it twice and its so yummy and smells great.

I have been there over the years and have been amazed at the faith of the millions of people who visit it. The Buddhists, the Hindus, the Christians, the Muslims and those of many faiths from all over the world. It reminds me of this Sufi saint's grave in Ajmer, India. What I would like to advice travellers who are sceptics over faith in general, is not to visit Kataragama God. It is a holy place with a lot of power that goes beyond your measurement scales. I have had several friends who have expressed sceptism and I have seen unpleasant things happening to them during the same night. One of my uncles was lost all night and we could not find him. It appears that he had a temporary ""memory loss"" that night after he told some sceptic things about the heathen who believe in Kataragama God. Kataragama temple has some thing called ""pooja"" which is an offering at 6.30 pm in the evening, 4.30 am and 10.30 am. People generally take a bath before hand, wear white clothing and visit the temple grounds without headwear and footwear.  If you are interested in more details, check out the website above. The historical ""pada yathra"" , walk from the North to the South is also an interesting event, in the likes of ""camino de santiago"".","August 24, 2012",0.0,0.0

Tourists have to remove their head gear and footwear to visit the temples, and must be appropriately dressed covering the entire body.
