Pretty much, it's hard to get to this monastery and we had our driver drive us to panama (the town the monastery is located) and we had to get a tuktuk for the rest of the trip (which is pretty much 30min of uneven bumpy road. Please please note; this is a religious site so dress appropriately, cover up your shoulders and legs!! We opted to do the walk at 430 for sunset, so had to leave arugam bay 330pm. The walk itself is pleasant, it took us roughly 1.5hrs maybe less, it only becomes tough in the last 5minutes as it becomes quite vertical (descending is hard for people with bad knees but it's quite short so just toughen up). I brought my runners which had good grip but our driver did it in barefoot the whole way haha and the other guy did it in jandals (I probably would just recommend sensible running shoes). Anyway the view from the top was AMAZINGLY MIND BLOWING, it was so peaceful and serene as we were the only people doing the walk. It was cool taking a guide because he told us random stories but you can definitely do the walk without a guide/driver.

Among those, •Visiting the monastery out of visiting hours. •Taking & Drinking Alcohol in the Monastery area which is totally prohibited by the monastery rules. •Taking pictures while climbing on Stupa (Ancient scared Ruins) & show disrespectful. • Dress inappropriately (not covering your self properly) •Entering the premises to the Monastery (Where the monks live & Scared Stupa situated) with shoes on (clearly mention on boards the areas that you should remove your shoes) As a traveller I have been to many countries & have been visited beautiful places. Every country got their own rules & regulations should obey by the foreign visitors to protect their valuable places, Every visitor must respect the places where ever you visit by obeying the rules. This way you will be protecting these beautiful places for the future travellers. If you are a foreign traveller planning to visit this Monastery please respect the rules even though the local guides go easy on Monastery rules. BE A RESPECTABLE TRAVELLER NOT A SELFISH TRAVELLER !!!!!!!!!!!! Also remember this attraction is not a place for the fun & boozing, if you are after those, please find another place....plenty out there other than this scared place where monks are meditating all the time in the jungle area in their Kutis that they need peace & quite all the time.

A round trip should cost around 3000 rupees per tuk tuk. It's not a hard climb up once you arrive, most of the way up is through tree cover though it is bare rock right at the top for the last five minutes of the climb. Make sure you take the path up from the red sign that tells you No hats shoes etc. If you go past the sign it takes you to another shrine (begumbala) which is worth visiting but doesn't have nice views. The view at the top is amazing! We went up at around 8:30am and it was already scorching hot so would recommend getting there as early as possible. It would probably be amazing for sunrise/sunset.

The adventure started only a few miles down the way where the road was blocked by a young bull elephant – well, that's what the driver said, I wasn't going anwhere near enough to verify either age or gender. It got chased off by a lorry that we then slipstreamed and then arrived near the monastery where we joined a line of pilgrims carrying goods to the monks. We split from them and then went onto the rocks, and I took off my shoes as ordered by my guide. Up there the views were quite extraordinary and imposing, while the guide pointed out the many caves where monks had once lived, the pools in the rocks where they would have bathed, and the rock that was in the shape of the Buddha sleeping. And then to the monastery itself, which wasn't quite as impressive as the surrounding rocks. These rise above the forest and the sea so that watching the sun come up is exquisite.

Quick aside I recommend you use Mahroof of Kiwi safari for any of the local trips. He is a wonderful guy and his English is fantastic. This is a climb. You drive half way into the national park on a bumpy road. From here you take a side road through dense forest. All around the insects, monkeys and birds make the kinds of noises you've only ever heard in jungle films. Upon arrival lock up anything safe as if you don't the monkeys will have it. The monkeys are very tame and will come extremely close to you but do beware. These are still wild animals and they've been known to jump on people and on rare occasions to bite. Neither happened to us but it is worth being mindful of the possibility. We started with a gentle incline through forest and rock to get to the current monastery. This is gorgeously situated at the top of a medium sized hill. Along the way you see and hear amazing scenes of nature and the old buildings. The view is spectacular with ponds full of frogs, forest, valleys and more. We then headed back down and at the cave entrance we took a different fork and headed up a much steeper climb. As we turned the corner from a tough bit of flat rock and forest we were greeted with an extremely steep set of very small stairs heading up flat rock. My youngest son and my wife got half way up the first small section before having to turn back. The rest of us pressed on. Now I'm a little out of shape but not unfit (I've completed 3 triathlons and a couple of 5k runs this year) but this was quite tough. When we got half way I had to take a break. The heat and humidity didn't help but... the views... At the top you see the ancient stipa and you get the most amazing views I've seen in a very long time. This is totally worth it. I would happily have simply sat there meditating on the view alone for hours if it wasn't for my middle son wanting to get back down (plus those left behind getting restless).

He was as much to do with the trip as the monastery. You can find him by going to hideaway resort, they  will hook you up. Being a Buddhist, Jaya's understanding and so his information was from his soul. Making our visit very beautiful. The walk to the top of the Rock is a must. The view is amazing. Across to the ocean and over the national forest. It also gives you a great perspective on the lay out of the hermitage. A very magical and spiritual place, that you feel privileged to get a glimpse of.","February 8, 2015",0.0,0.0

It represents all that I love about Sri Lanka : it is simple, humble, honest, and spiritually fulfilling. I would recommend sunrise or sunset. If you are hiking to the highest rock you will want sneakers or bare feet (I always do it barefoot). But with that in mind, the rocks get SUPER hot as they bake in the sun all day, so be mindful if you are going later in the day. enjoy!","October 8, 2014",0.0,0.0

The path that leads to where the ancient monastery is interesting. If you like to listen to the sounds of nature this is one of the places I would recommend. Dress modestly,respect the quietness and observe the beautiful place. It is better if you can start to climb the rock early morning so as to avoid the heat. Very good in evening to watch the sun sets. You may able to see wild elephants if you do the trip evening. You can travel by your own vehicle or rent a tuk tuk,don't try on motor bike in the evening.(because of the elephants). Don't miss this trip if you are planning to come to Arugambay.","September 4, 2014",0.0,0.0
