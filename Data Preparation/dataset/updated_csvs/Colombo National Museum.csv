The museum was open for visitors, contrary to Google, which showed it was closed on Thursday. Tickets: I took a combined ticket for the Colombo Museum and the Natural Science Museum, which cost me 1500 LKR. Time Required: Given that the Museum closes at 6 pm, I had to rush a little; however, if you are a museum and history geek, you can easily spend 3-4 hours here, as the collection of artefacts of beautiful. Crowd: I visited on a weekday, so the crowd was less; however, the place is big enough to accommodate bigger crowds as well. Overall, a great experience. This building itself has a history of its own. Plus, there are many artefacts associated with Buddhism, so a good place to learn the history (political, cultural and economic) of the country.","October 28, 2025",0.0,0.0

The building was pretty imposing ng and well looked after. The staff were all very friendly and welcoming. The ticket prices were competitive. The signage was excellent. Everything was arranged in chronological order from prehistory onwards. There was just enough information to read on each placard, and what it said was very clear. The prehistoric section was fascinating and had just enough artefacts to demonstrate points but not so many that it was overwhelming. There was a marvelous section on stupa architecture and Buddhist statues. The colonial furniture was much loved and looked after, which was a relief. I enjoyed the costume section showing the diversity of Sri Lankan culture. Overall this was a great way to spend three or four hours and get an overview of Sri Lankan history and archaeology. I highly recommend it.","October 7, 2025",0.0,0.0

Next local customer paid with a 500 Rp bill. So I expected to receive that. But no, she but it in the drawer and got another 1000 bill out of the drawer. In order words: she definitely had the exchange, and she did lie anout that. This was plain cheating. I told her, she just kept on smiling and saying sorry. Very clear that this was not accidentally, but on purpose. If the manage to do this 10 times a day, that is 5000 Rp. Note that a tea picker makes around 2000 Rp a day, a police officer around 3000 - 6000 Rp a day. So from their perspective this is a lot of money. So count the exchange.","October 4, 2025",0.0,0.0

After seeing word of mouth that there was no air conditioning and it was hot, I visited in Asaichi the day after arriving in Sri Lanka. He was refused credit cards and said to have no change, so he was first christened in this less functional country. The journey that followed was thought of, and it was the right one. The GF is roughly displayed by period and the upper floor by theme. One of my favorites is the bronze statue of Shiva Nataraja in Polonnaruwa in the 12th century.

There were a lot of different artifacts however there was a lot of seemingly repetitive and underwhelming items on display too. There seemed a lot of coins and the like as well as a whole section devoted to masonry with carvings and while there were probably people wanting to see them it seemed like an awful lot of similar items. There were collections various collections. Some more interesting than others. There was an animatronic display which was quite good too. This for me was very much a one visit location.

We saw lovely original pieces and some reproductions with the originals held by the colonist countries still (very sad). The larger general descriptions were well written and helpful, but the objects themselves were only labeled with no identifying facts, which I found frustrating.

We walked and walked (quickly to get upstairs before the 4pm closing time for upper floors) and were stuck behind a large tour group part of the time, which was very frustrating as they stood in front of important pieces, not moving to let others in to see.

If anyone wants to know about the amazingly close civlisational, cultural, artistic and spiritual bonds between Sri Lanka and India during the various eras of history, there is no better place to discover it than in this museum. It will surprise and disappoint those who believe Hinduism and Buddhism are dissimilar or mutually antagonistic. The museum has relatively less focus on Sri Lanka's Islamic heritage. I had gone to see the trilingual (Chinese, Tamil, Persian) stone inscription about the voyage of the great Chinese explorer Zheng He (1371-1433), who visited both Sri Lanka and India. The inscription shows that he offered prayers to Allah, Buddha and Shiva (a Hindu deity) for his own safety and for peace in the world. A good historical example of Sri Lanka-India-China affinity. My two big complaints about the museum: 1) The Museum Shop is hopelessly small and short of material on sale; and 2) The museum guides should be proficient in English and know more about the history of the museum and its exhibits.

The displays are well laid out and presented with substantial information in 3 languages. However it is very hot inside this museum and not all the fans were working when we were there.

Enjoy the Buddha statues and related stuff, but it goes downhill from there in my view. Yes it is the national museum in the capital so it has an encyclopedic collection, but unless you want to see every old farm tool in often not very well lit displays, you can really speed up. I was time-limited anyway, but seriously an hour was enough for a visit. Yes it is an old building, so lacks a/c, and route is one way to upstairs then out on side of building. The price had gone up from guidebook 600r. to 1000r. and as it is a national museum that sounds OK, as likely all tourists will go. However the museum in Kandy is much better value in my view- a much more compact and curated collection. The highlights of this one really, and very presented and lit, despite guidebook comments that it was like Colombo, dusty, unlit etc.","March 10, 2018",0.0,0.0

The Museum is full of artifacts from different Lankan eras. Although I spent 6-7 hours in the Museum and tried to read as many posted placards on history as possible, yet I couldn't get enough of this beautiful country's glorious past and ups & downs over the centuries!!! Despite the fact that Museum wasn't air conditioned and Sri Lankan sultry weather couldn't be tamed by those old colonial pedestal fans being used inside the museum we still enjoyed the visit and learned a fair deal about Sri Lanka. Huge collection of Buddha statues, coins, ceramic, daggers, bows & arrows, swords, guns, silverware, jewelry etc lie in wait for admirers and history buffs & students. The entry fee SL Rupee 1000/- seem a bit high for one Museum (2nd one is small and not much to see). Museum building is spread over great acreage with its magnificent white color. Lot needs to be done to add beauty and prestige that this Museum deserves. More detail on each item will definitely benefit, and interactive touch screen will help visitors to learn more about Sri Lanka and its history.

If I remember correctly, there are some stone works in section 3. This area gives a good overview of how and why stone works were important at that time. They has been used largely to store information, for example land ownership, taxation rights, demarcation points and etc. Also, in day to day live (example toilets, baths) .The details, the precision, the tools available and the material used gives an idea about the knowledge level at that time. The adjacent display was based on craft, jewellery,  weaponry and artefacts. There is a small section dedicated for jewellery worn by kings and queens. It is truly breathtaking. The artists have taken extraordinary care to preserve the original structure of gems embedded, they have handmade minute links connected in multiple dimensions. Some of those jewels are currently in fashion but they are nowhere near what was achieved at that time. You have to see it to understand. This whole room contains the Srilankan craft heritage. Since craft and artistic excellence is a demonstration of how advanced the society is, the ordinary population seems to have lived in a sophisticated healthy society during this time.

The building alone is magnificent and would warrant a visit, but the exhibits really make it great. My personal favourites were the burial methods in the prehistoric room, the last Sri Lankan king's throne and jewels, and the room with clothes and embroidery. Some of the displays with mannequins are a little cheesy and the information signs can be a bit confusing, especially if you don't have a great grasp of Buddhism. It is good to have so much information in English though. We were also surprised to see someone welding in a stairwell that is the main exit from the last gallery, but lucky for us, he stopped to let us past!!

It founder was Sir William Henry Gregory, the British Governor of Ceylon (Sri Lanka) at the time. The Royal Asiatic Society (CB) was instrumental in bringing to the notice of Gregory on his appointment as Governor in 1872 the need for a public museum with much difficulty the approval of the legislative council was obtained within a year. The Architect of the Public Works Department, J.G. Smither was able to prepare the plans for new structure on Italian architectural style. The construction was completed in 1876 and the Museum commenced it functions in the following year. The Authorities of the museum took various steps to display the cultural and natural heritage of the country for this purpose. With the development of the museum to international level, it earned the status of a national museum during the period of Dr. P. E. P. Deraniyagala. He was able to open up branch museums in Jaffna, Kandy and Ratnapura and a full - fledged Department of National Museums was established in 1942 under the act No. 31. The extension of the number of branch museums has now increased to nine and in addition a school science programme and a mobile museum service are also in operation. This process has further been improved by the arrangement of the galleries of the ground floor in a historical sequence and those of the upper galleries on a thematic basis.
