There are plenty of eager tuk tuk drivers around the bus station but the short distance to the fort doesn't merit one. At the main road turn left and cross over to head across the bridge over the Nilwala Ganga, noting the very colonial looking building on the near bank to your right. This temple's splendid architecture compliments the river setting and makes a nice photo opportunity on your way to the fort. At this point you are now on Main Street - stay on the right side making your way past numerous street sellers and a small market on your right until you reach the first right turn and on the opposite side you will see the gate to the Start Fort.  If this is shut and it appears closed see if you can attract the attention of someone inside; the guides are keen for visitors and beckoned to us to come in. Bear in mind though that this could be the start of a 'tour' not just a friendly welcome. The fort The fort itself is small, so small in fact it is more of a strongpoint than a fort. Originally it was intended that the nearby ramparts should form part of more extensive defensive fortifications but cost cutting curtailed this, saved money and rendered them inadequate for their role. As a result the much smaller Star Fort was planned though it would not have offered much protection for the small number of people it could have sheltered from attack. Although the area was held for little more than a year after the Kandyan kingdom captured it in 1760 before it was retaken by the Dutch in 1762, they remained conscious of their vulnerabilities. As you approach you may have your attention drawn to a rather forlorn looking lone crocodile in the moat. We were told crocodiles aided in the defence but it's impossible to believe the crocodile we saw was not brought here as a tourist attraction. If you look to the right at this point there are also some large rocks protruding from the water in the angle of the moat that seem to be a favoured basking spot for turtles (hopefully not there to help feed the crocodile). You enter the fort itself over a drawbridge with the year of completion, 1765, above it along with the governor's coat of arms and the emblem of the VOC (Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie) or Dutch East INdia Company. Once across it is likely that your guide will give you a quick demonstration to show how simply the drawbridge was raised before proceeding. It leads into a circular courtyard with a central well and both the Fort barracks and commander's quarters opposite. When we visited these were off limits and we could not enter them. Turning back access to the rampart is via a ramp for the short walk around the embrasures. The walls seem impressively thick and although no cannon remain it looks quite powerful. In reality though its military value was probably negligible and it must have been a disappointing alternative to the fortifications originally hoped for. In truth there isn't a great deal to see and a tour of the whole fort can easily be accomplished in as little as 10-15 minutes. On leaving, although admission is free, you will almost certainly be asked for a donation to assist with its upkeep, 300 rupees being suggested in our case. It is an interesting spot and perhaps a place to ‘tick off’ if you are visiting Matara or there for a more extended stay, but if you don’t have an interest in history there isn’t all that much to see.","May 26, 2015",0.0,0.0
