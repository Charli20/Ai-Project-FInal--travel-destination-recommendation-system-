The folk part basically means the history of the Sri Lankan people with particular relevance to the countryside traditions and agriculture - and that was even better as a rounded view of the pre-industrial era in Sri Lanka. A great collection of traditional dress, tools, vehicles and more. And then there is the buildings devoted to the life of the author also. We took a guide who was super informative and had a great two-way conversation about so much about Sri Lankan life and the context of the author's life. Very happy we went, beautiful calm place. I think we sent somewhere between an hour and an hour and a half, but could of stayed longer time permitting, but also you could easily cut it down to a 45 mins or less visit if so minded.

The museum has almost every icon related to the Sri Lankan history. This is nice place situated at Galle and you need to travel around 12 km from highway exit from Galle to reach this place.  This museum is a beautiful place to visit if you want to get an idea of life in Sri Lanka in a previous era. The place is really beautiful. Highly recommend. It is a beautifully curated museum depicting the livelihoods, costumes and traditions of Sri Lanka. The artifacts are tastefully arranged, well maintained and descriptions of the exhibits are very clear and concise. The items are methodically arranged in different buildings around the very large property. This museum complex houses a number of historical artifacts, implements and photographs which are very rare to find nowadays even in Sri Lankan homes. A must see for the Sri Lankan kids to appreciate what life was like in olden days.   Mr. Wickramasinghe was one of the most honoured writers of Sri Lanka, by both western and eastern world. His writing style depicted the simplicity inherited by our ancestors. This is his birth place. There are a lot of photographs and almost all his books and there is a bookshop to buy his books.  On a higher ground, his and his beloved wife's tombs can be seen. The sense of comfort and peacefulness that you will get when you enter this place is profound. The grounds are shady and is well kept with named specimen trees and lily ponds. The exhibition buildings, thought a little hot and stuffy are full of fascinating exhibits and photographs and the guides are helpful and well informed.  The highlight of the museum compound is the residence of the writer himself. The extensive selection of his personal items gives a very thorough indication of his life, works and his contribution to the literary society. The gardens of the huge compound are beautifully maintained with huge selection of indigenous trees that are all well labeled.  There is a bookshop with a limited selection of English translations of Mr. Wickramasinghe's books.   When you visit his house you will understand that simplicity will help you to find that balance. Also there is a place to eat if you bring foods from outside. This museum is definitely worth a visit if you are in the Galle area.","July 16, 2018",0.0,0.0

Wickramasinghe’s unceasing intellectual exploration and his creative and critical writings relating to the life and culture of the people of Sri Lanka continued for a period of over 70 years”. The Folk museum is an ideal place to get to know the author better, to understand a little of what Koggala and its people meant to him.

It is an insight to the folk life of the Sri Lanka people of yesteryear. I was amazed to see that Mr. Martin Wickramasinhe has received many Awards & Honors from other countries including the OBE “Order of the British Empire but no honor even posthumously from the Sri Lankan government although it bestows honors on persons who cannot even hold a candle to Mr. Wickramasinghe. There were boards stating “no photography”, “Do not touch the exhibits” but Sri Lankan visitors flouted these rules in broad daylight. There were very old men to guard these who were powerless when brawny men brazenly did not care & took photographs of the exhibits & sat on the antique chairs of Mr. Wickramasinghe. The garden is well laid out & full of rare trees which have name boards. There is no CCTV to cover to monitor this place & it needs professional security staff. It is a shame that such a museum charges on Rs 30 from Sri Lankans & this allows all the ruffians to enter, consume alcohol in the premises & destroy this gem of a museum. I have paid more than US$ 25 to see museums which have less to offer. I feel that Sri Lankans should be charged at least Rs. 500/= per head to visit this museum. The book shop offers Mr. Wickramasinhe’s books at a discounted price. I also found the ruins of Mr. Wickramasinhe’s uncles house adjacent to his house.

In a large covered area outside was a display of carts, coaches and carriages from the past, though most of these were in a bad state of repair and could do with some restoration.  Finally I went to the small traditional bungalow which had been the home of Martin Wickramainghe, who was one of the foremost Sri Lankan writers of the 20th century.

The samadhi and the house of his birth are symbols that span over seven decades of continuous intellectual exploration and creative writing. The high-roofed,spacious halls of the Folk Museum house a vast array of artifacts of Sri Lankan folk culture and life. Traditional vehicles used for travel and transport such as carriages and canoes are displayed in separate sheds.
