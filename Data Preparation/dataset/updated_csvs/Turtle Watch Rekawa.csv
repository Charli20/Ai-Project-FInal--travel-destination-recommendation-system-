Booking through the local protection program, from the ticket station you start with guide , only red light allowed on the beach. Respectful treatment of the animals, we could see 3 turtles, very impressive.  Participants are given group numbers, when animals are sighted, a single group is called in, several guides supervise (and control) the participants.

You come to the conservation office in Rekawa around 7.30 to 8 pm where you receive a numbered ticket. The tickets are your group number of which there will only be ten per group. Then you wait for the beach watchers to radio staff when a turtle comes ashore. The beach is closed to the public after 7 pm and two police officers ensure there is no one there. It is only then the group with numbers pay for their tickets. Then everyone traverses to the part of the beach near the turtle laying. The guide calls over your group number so there are only 10 people near the turtle at a time. There should only be the red light from the guides torch but some flashes went off from cameras which shouldn't happen!!! Then you can photo/film the process. It was amazing to experience this enormous creature come back to the beach she was born on to lay her eggs and then slowly return to the sea. Would highly recommend this experience to anyone. The money supports the turtles of course and even though we had only the one turtle I'm sure in full season there would be more. FABULOUS experience I would not have missed! Come to Rekawa!!!!!!

We saw 4 giant green turtles building their nests and the laying their eggs and then covering them up and then struggling back into the ocean and we also were so fortunate to see a few of the hatchlings running into the Ocean too. The young man with us - Isuru - was fantastic.  He was patient, careful and SO KNOWLEDGEABLE.    He explained that they had special education with a marine biologist and he was able to answer all of my questions of which there were many. I think we were very lucky as there were only about six other people there with us, but I would imagine that it can get quite hectic.

Some practicalities, as we had the feeling we lost quite some time; -the information center opens about 7pm I think -as from 8:30pm, turtle -watchers supervise the beach for turtles. They keep the guide in the center informed. -once turtles have been seen, they sell starting tickets (2000rps pp); they do no check this afterwards, but sponsorship is needed. The day we were there, that was at about 10pm, so we were already waiting for about 1,5h. It can happen no turtles show up, then it’s a no-show and everybody goes home -we entered the beach with the entire group and approached the turtle to about 40m. The guide regularly checked on the turtle; once egg-laying starts, you can approach, in our case that was at about 11:30pm. -we left then, but you can stay until the turtle returns to sea, but that can another 1,5h While approaching the turtle, we had mixed feelings; great to witness this wonder of nature, but not sure if this did not disturb the turtle.","July 27, 2024",0.0,0.0

After several attempts, this time we were actually able to watch turtles laying eggs. It was unique and fascinating for us. We are very grateful for that. What was very negative for us were the local ranchers. We have never experienced anything like it before and we are certainly not the kind of people who complain. We have had many animal encounters and know how to behave. However, these ranchers thought they had to constantly bully and patronize us. There were several of them and someone else kept telling us to go further away, etc. We were not allowed to use our red headlamps, which we had brought with us especially for this purpose, because it doesn't bother the turtles. We stood there very quietly, 2 meters away, didn't move, just watched. The ranchers, on the other hand, had their red headlamps and were constantly removing branches and sand from the turtle, so that it had no peace at all. The animals help themselves and should be left alone, as we were constantly told, even though we were as quiet as a mouse. When the turtle then looked for the way into the sea, we cleared a large passage. However, we were supposed to go to the other side. We did that. Then another rancher came and said we were standing too close to the sea, that it was too dangerous, that we should go away. That was really the icing on the cake. To be honest, it felt a little like harassment. We are adults, independent thinkers and this kind of behavior ruins such a unique nature experience.","May 16, 2024",0.0,0.0

We left early in the morning and arrived around 11 a.m. Very beautiful beach, but then what a crowd. A crazy world. But the spectacle is magnificent, as the site is immense and the giant green turtles are there in 80 cm of water over hundreds of meters. In the sand and rocks. We stayed for more than an hour living with them, and dozens of children petting them. We give them lichen which we buy from sellers on the beach. Around 1 euro, the package. Forbidden to give anything else. The happiness of the children who tend this lichen and whose turtle eats delicately. They are between two waters, impressive. You can take very beautiful photos and magnificent videos with your iPhone. The show is worth going to. In Tuck-Tuck it's ideal, it goes everywhere. and we see the landscape in another way. In addition, they are helpful, and accompany you to unique or different places that tourist agencies offer. For 25 dollars, it is at your service all day. We were lucky enough to have a young driver, who liked to show us wild places far from the tour operators. They are at the HOTEL for your service, day and night.. Take advantage if you are in the SOUTH. You will have no regrets. I made beautiful videos and photos of the various sites visited in the country, for my conferences with the elderly people I visit in retirement homes, and who have never had the pleasure of seeing these places. I am also an elderly person and am fortunate to still be in good health to travel far. They are passionate, rather friendly and family-oriented.","April 10, 2024",0.0,0.0

I was initially concerned about the low google star rating, but the experience paid off. After a short briefing, our throng was allowed to sit in the waiting area for the spotters to locate a nesting turtle. We only had to wait 5 minutes before one was located. Our large throng marched down the steps and onto the beach and the guide made us stand back. He approached the turtle with his red light and called each group, one at a time, for crowd control purposes. We were also instructed to move away once we were done. Each group got great views of the digging, laying of the eggs, covering of the eggs with the ""dance"", and the return to the ocean. It seems that your experience can vary based on the ability of the crowd of tourists to obey simple commands, which ours did. It's a shame some of the low ratings are due to bad behavior on the part of tourists. I myself had a terrific time. After the first turtle returned to sea, the guide offered to locate a green turtle (a different type) to see its own process. Some people decided to remain and wait for that -- it sounds like they are willing to stick around to enhance your experience as much as possible. Donations are highly recommended afterwards, 1500 LKR recommended for foreigners.","February 11, 2024",0.0,0.0

The team keep a record of the time the eggs are laid and knowing the gestation period dig up the relocation before they escape naturally by burrowing through the sand and putting themselves at risk in this vulnerable phase.We had the opportunity to see this scenario with the team and a controlled environment as this was a ridley olive turtle which are very sluggish in surfacing and entering sea up to two hours.The need to be observed the whole time as they are a rare species due to this fact that many never make it There are pros and cons to conservation and protection vs onlookers and disturbance  but the project needs finance to support it and the cons are overcome by control and supervision wherever possible.That is the reality and hopefully most tourists will show a level of awareness and respect for the rules","March 13, 2023",0.0,0.0

We did not pay any money until one of the scouts had notified the main office that a turtle had been spotted. Once we got close to the turtle smaller groups of 10-12 people approached to within 2 meters of the turtle and had our turn taking photos.
