It’s a place with a historical value which built before the 21st century. According to Mahavamsa, the great chronicle of the Sinhalese, Lovamahapaya was a massive nine storied building with a height of 150 ft (47 meters) and each side with a 150 feet (46 meters) length. The building was supported by 40 rows of stone pillars with 40 pillars which totaled 1600 pillars. In each level there were 1000 rooms and 100 windows. Its roof was covered with copper-bronze plates. This was supposedly a refectory of the old city and was a huge building with the roof covered with bronze tiles. What is left now are the pillars of the building , many standing erect. This was Built more than 21 centuries ago. Situated between the Sri maha bodiya and Ruwanweli Seya.  Entrance is free but cant go in to the house. This is some-thing you have to see. History says its a 9 storey building built for the monks by the king Dutugemunu. There are about 1500 stone pillars and would assume it was the foundation of this huge building. We wonder how the humans then made these stuff when there was no machinery or advance technologies existed. These ruins are believed to be the living quarters of Buddhist monks during Anuradhapura Era. Folklore is that it has been a multi storied building. What remains is large number of stone pillars. No doubt that it would have been an engineering There is no evidence of any holes/ grooves to fix any wooden or stone floor above the remaining stone pillars to support the multi-story theory. Lovamahapaya was a 9 story building which had a rock base and upper floors were made by wood. This has destroyed by foreign invasions, but the base of it still can be seen. The king Devamnampiyatissa, the first Buddhist king of the country build a chapter house in this location on the instructions Mahinda Thero who brought Buddhism to the country. A century later king Dutugamunu (161-131 BC) built a massive structure of which the remains you see today. This is one of the amazing ruins showing how advance the ancient technology with limited mechanization prevailed in that era. Unfortunately this is invisible to many as this gigantic structure is hidden between two most popular temples and sometimes the story of the building has not been communicated enough This was well preserved. I think government should keep the places like this well preserved. We went there at night, and it was beautifully lit up. What we could see were stone pillars that were erected but some slanting presently. I recommend you to see it. Evening visit is more convenient because of the warm weather.","April 12, 2018",0.0,0.0
