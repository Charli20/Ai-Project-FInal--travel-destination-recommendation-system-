Just must do. The Baker's fall are a part of The Horton Plains National park which is one of the most beautiful locations in Sri Lanka. It is a 9km circle which has three stops along the way – Mini World’s End, World’s End and Baker’s Fall. The trail is easy (will short patches of incline along the way which are easy to climb) and breathtakingly beautiful. Finish it off with a cup of tea and biscuits at the canteen overlooking the plains. On more practical information, the entrance to the plains is an hour’s drive from Nuwara Elliya (approximately) and the tickets are slightly expensive (but worth every penny). Take the route on the left (which reaches baker’s fall last) since it’s a better way to circle the plains. Also, if you get tired halfway and feel the urge to turn back – don’t, because even if you turn back you’ll have the same distance to cover and you’ll miss the trail on the other side.","June 11, 2016",0.0,0.0
