It was pretty wavey but fun to swim in, also saw many beginner surfers there. During our 7 day stay the water was clean except from one day. There were a few surf schools, couple of restaurants and bars and overall relaxed feeling. For fun and nightlife it doesn't have too many options.","February 28, 2019",0.0,0.0
