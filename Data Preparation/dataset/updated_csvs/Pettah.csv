So Pettah in 2025 is an Indian provincial town in the 200s... Nothing new was found for themselves. The anchor place - the floating market - is frankly dying.

In the beginning, the whole city could fit into the Fort, and the British colonialists considered Pettah to be ""black"" areas where it was not worth poking a white man's nose. Everyone lives in Pettakh now. It is the shopping and transportation hub of Colombo. There is a railway station and a bus station here. The area itself is a large flea market, where they sell everything. Most of the tourist landmarks are also located here. The symbol of the area is the Khan Tower on Main Street. It is named after the initiator of the construction, a family of wealthy Parsis from Bombay. The Old Town Hall, where the City Council met for 50 years until 1925, is also here. By the way, there is now a corresponding museum in the Dutch period Town Hall. If the commercial part (for example, the Pettah floating market) is located in the south, then the sacred establishments, on the contrary, are in the north. It is the most beautiful mosque in Colombo- Jamul Alfar, the main Protestant church during the Dutch rule - Volvendaal (the name means Valley of Wolves) and the most important Hindu temple complex - old and new Kathiresan, dedicated to the god of war Skanda. There is no greater variety of attractions in Colombo.…","November 19, 2025",0.0,0.0

The store  is small but very busy with a wide selection of different styles and colours.  I enjoyed the market and each road sells different items.  However, getting a Uber back to our hotel was a little tricky. You have to find a clear area where they can pick up you from, which we did near a Hindu Temple on one of the main roads.

Pettah impressed me with her madness and chaos. The market area itself is so rowdy and congested. Lorries, trucks and wagons conveying loads of cargoes, pushed their way mercilessly and ruthlessly through the narrow alleys. If you are not alert and cautious, the reckless driver may just knock you down. The agricultural produce from the rural areas and the overseas import all arrived here either for the market sale or for storage in the warehouses. Cheap toys, fruits, electrical products, garment and a myriad of local produce are displayed in shops and on floors sometime obstructing pedestrian walkway. I was surprised to see exotic fruit like durians among the many market display. I had pure coconut drinks from a hawker  who sold me one coconut for 60 rupees. The intense heat of the afternoon sun made me thirsty and drinking healthy fresh coconut juices helped to quench my thirst instantly. Do try the local orange coconut if you are at the market. I visited the Old Town Hall and the staff reluctantly opened a wax museum room at the second floor showcasing the colonial government municipal officials hold their meeting at the Old Town Hall during the British days. I also visited the stunningly impressive `Red Mosque' and a Hindu temple in the vicinity of this market. A Clock Tower stands proudly at a road junction of Pettah. It is a maze wandering around Pettah and every bustling street has something to boast about on the merchandise sold. At one street, it was all the clothing and garment. At another street, it was all the electronic products and hardware. The public bus 187 from the airport ended at Pettah and the terminal is located on a slip road across the Colombo Fort Train Station. I came to Pettah on my last day in Sri Lanka not only to explore Pettah but also to board this public bus to the airport.  I only paid 60 rupees for the whole journey from Pettah to the airport. But a word of caution, do not take this bus if you are rushing to the airport. The journey took more than an hour as it stopped at every bus stops to fetch passengers. You are deemed not to have visited Colombo if you did not visit Pettah.","April 6, 2019",0.0,0.0

The streets were filled with people and tuk-tuks and hand driven carts and mobile vendors, everyone expertly finding out a way to move forward without hitting each other. The prices in Pettah Market are very real, compared to the tourist shops where guides take you. You can expect a bargain of 10-15% at the most.

Clothes on hangers, in bales or simple in piles, shoes, sox, belts,  electronic goods, DVDs, tools, baubles, broaches, bangles and maybe even pearls. Pettah is where Sri Lankans come when they want to buy something at the cheapest possible price. It is the antithesis of Odels. Sellers and buyers haggle and the noise is constant yet not overpowering. Prices asked of foreigners are four to five time what the seller would normally expect so if you do not bargain you deserve to be ripped off. Do not expect quality. The second building housed sellers of every conceivable variety of fruits and vegetables. Heaps of green chilies, carrots, cauliflowers, gourds and aborigines of all shapes and sizes to name just a few, join with the mangos, pawpaws, wood apple, pineapples, passion fruits and other tropical fruits to present an artist’s palette  of color and textures to tempt the most discerning cook. There are also a few sellers of spices and even one or two selling dried salted fish which are a popular delicacy not just here in Sri Lanka but throughout the region.  I see that some reviewers have turned up their noses and that the vendor was burning incense sticks.  But lets face it, this market is a garden of roses compared to the salt and dry fish markets of the SE Asia. And speaking of smells, I found a fruit vendor selling Sri Lankan durians. I bought one and tried it on the spot but sad to say it was no match to its relatives grown in Vietnam, Thailand or Malaysia. The third building was not occupied when I visited.

The overcrowded labyrinth of lanes and alleys is truly fascinating. Goods are stacked on the roadsides in heaps so the best way to move around is either on foot or on a rickshaw. If you want to find bargains like antiques and vibrant textile products this is the place. Just do not forget to haggle and bring the prices down. You can easily do your designer shopping of expensive ceramics and branded clothes in the posh areas of Colombo but this where you go to feel the pulse of the city and to witness its flurry and mayhem  The only warnings are- beware of the pickpockets and the creeps who pinch ladies’ behinds, never eat from the food carts and avoid gemstone peddlers  like plague.","August 26, 2011",0.0,0.0

Pettah market is a very busy, smelly, hot, crowded, sticky place to be. BUT ITS AMAZING :-) its great fun, you can find some great bargains amoungst the best tack you have ever seen!! great for gifts, material, and necklaces etc. The shops are close together and in front of them there are stalls selling...well you name it :-) When you walk amoungst the stalls and shops you will be chatted to in the normal Lankan street vendor stylee... just smile and say no thank you, they will leave you alone. If they dont, just duck into the nearest shop where they would never dare to enter. It is normal in Sri Lanka for tourists to pay more than locals, you will find this often clearly displayed on the price boards of tourist hot spots such as the elephant orphange or other popular sites. this is deliberate, to enable more local people to use the attractions. Seeing as most Lankans live on very little, dont go overboard on the haggling but do ensure you get a bargain :-) if you buy from a street vendor.  shops should have prices labelled but if in doubt ask. If you have a native speaker with you its handy, as not all shops will speak english.  Often your hotel will be able to arrange for a young man to accompany you for a small cost (and a tip for the guy on the day) if you ask nicely. Hotels in Sri Lanka normally cannot do enough for you if you ask nicely and smile!! So head down to Pettah and get in the hustle and bustle, breathe in the scents and experience the sights and bargains!! But follow these rules: 1. Keep your possesions tucked away... you have only yourself to  blame if you get your pockets raided here... 2. Ladies, in Sri Lanka try to not go everywhere in hot pants and a vest top... most women there are quite modest and most never reveal cleavage... you stand out as a tourist there anyway and in a place like this you dont want to draw attention to yourself even more or you will be hassled by the street vendors more. 3. that said, keep your clothing cool and it will of course be hot and sticky and take some water with you as standard 4. try to take a guide if you can, but dont worry if you cant! you will manage! 5. enjoy! Hmmm... and if you have some extra pennies left over try the businessmans lunch at the Hilton...not as expensive as you would imagine!","May 20, 2008",0.0,0.0
