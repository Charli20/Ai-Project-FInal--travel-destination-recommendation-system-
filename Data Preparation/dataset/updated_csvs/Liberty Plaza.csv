We went upstairs to the Saree and party wear department where I bought some incredibly cheap but beautiful ethnic dresses and the salesman insisted I try on a saree which he took time to show me how to wear it ! All the staff were very attentive and although it is quite oddly laid out , we soon got the hang of it . We even tried the food court which was excellent.","February 7, 2025",0.0,0.0

This happened on the Sunday and they wanted me to come on the weekday to speak to a office personnel, whom the security will solve the matter. However when i went for the same, they just threw me off telling that Rs.5,000 is a very inferior customer to them. They expected me to spend over Rs. 20,000 for them to consider as a customer. These were the same words that came out of the front desk adim officer who i was asked to speak to. I wanted to speak to a person in the higher level, however they did not let me do that.

I love this place because of old memories associated with the mall but visiting it is quite depressing. Most shops are closed on Sundays and nothing much in terms of entertainment. Some shops are definitely worth a visit. The leather shop on the 1st floor has some great goods on offer (little purses, wallets, visa holders), the cards shops, Nastars, the tiny book nook (great biographies) near Uthum Pathum are some classic shops. Of course the clothes shops are quite interesting and affordable at times. Uptown Kandy and the newer side has been a good attempt to liven up LP. There were some really great offers for branded denims in January. The food court and Keells are frequently visited by many in LP.

The mall itself has a wide variety of outlets with a good selection. The food court on the other hand has too many resident flies to bear thinking of. Discoloured plastic/melamine plates don't help matters either.,"May 15, 2017",0.0,0.0

Almost no directions given other than the EXIT sign if you want to get out. The Fire EXIT is badly maintained in both New and old wing. Only one lift available in the new wing as to what i experienced and it takes a pretty long time to hop in the lift. Substandard parking lot with probably the Highest you would pay in Colombo. Two coffee shops are available in the new wing where one shop with an International chain serves sub standard products. However, there is a considerably good food court at reasonable pricing and a variety of food. (Please checkout the attached parking fee for the duration of parking)","April 21, 2017",0.0,0.0

There is also a basement foodcourt that has a very good Sri Lankan food stall, with rice and curries and some short-eats. The food here was very tasty and reasonably priced as evidenced by the number of local customers eating rice and curry from this stall. I believe the prices here are fixed unlike at street stalls where you can haggle with the vendor. The goods that we looked at were very much targeting the local communities rather than tourists, which is probably a good thing for the tourist. It is by no means a large plaza in comparison to plazas in say Singapore, Bangkok, Hong Kong or Kuala Lumpur. However, this is probably a good thing given that many of those plazas in other countries seem just so bland and characterless and carrying a premium price to pay for their glitz. There were toilet facilities here, but take your own toilet paper and this applies to travelling around Sri Lanka everywhere – take your own toilet paper.","January 15, 2017",0.0,0.0
