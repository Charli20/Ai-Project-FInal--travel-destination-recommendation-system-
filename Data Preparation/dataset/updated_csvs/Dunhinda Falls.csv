The path includes stairs and railings, but it’s a bit of a climb, so some level of fitness is needed. Tickets are required and the site is open from 6 AM to 6 PM. Reaching the base of the waterfall isn’t possible—or would be too dangerous—due to the heavy water flow. It’s a unique waterfall with a powerful water mass and a constant misty atmosphere.","April 15, 2025",0.0,0.0

However, it's unfortunate that the local government has built small huts made of cadjan and sheet metal for local vendors, which detracts from the natural beauty of the area. I would advise not purchasing anything from these sellers, except for a bottle of water, as many of the products they offer are fake. For example, we were sold kitul jaggery, only to later discover that it was simply colored sugar pulp.","December 24, 2024",0.0,0.0

Dunhinda falls. Is one of the better one. It might be the third biggest after Bamarakanda  and Diyaluma Water Falls, The waterfalls is a must see. It was mind blowing. One of the nicest views I've seen before. Entrance fee is Rs 200. From the main road (near Badulla , on Badulla Kandy- Mahiyanngana Road) you have to walk for couple of Km. These falls are about 5 km outside of Badulla and I would recommend to take a TukTuk to the falls. The track in is a steady 30 to 40 minutes with a lot of steps. The walk can be a bit tough in the heat slippery with rain, especially with little children, so some willingness to hike by them should be there. There are many rest stops along the way, some with vendors selling cool drinks etc. The walk to the waterfall is one of the memorable thing in our tour.  Monkeys will check if you have food. We traveled in the evening, the path was tough to walk.. Once you reach the waterfall, listen to the sound of water flowing after a tiresome walk and you get an amazing feeling. It is one of the best waterfall to view in Sri Lanka and very picturesque. Try this journey to the water fall from the road only if you are fit enough to walk,  The road leading to the water fall was extremely rough, slippery since it was raining. Coming back is no easier, but the falls make it all worthwhile. It is very interesting place to visit due to the location. You will dive pass most wonderful scenery and breathtaking views on the way in to the hill country and that will be the most beautiful part of your journey.  It is not recommend to-do any silly activities when the water level is high as it could be risky. It is a very beautiful water fall in Badulla, Sri Lanka. The waterfalls is a must see. It was mind blowing. One of the nicest views I've seen before. Overall it was a great experience. The large amount of monkeys begging for food & people who actually feed the animals so they come back again. We can see the fall from both front and top side also. But for view from top side you must go across Medapathana village. It is more of an adventures way. There were a few guide dogs that followed us to show us the way. Who are friendly, tame, very intelligent so caring and helpful and they stopped when we stopped. If anyone who reads this review is visiting this place. Carry some food for them like for about 4-5 dogs. Bread will be good too. I recommend you to visit the water fall.","June 20, 2018",0.0,0.0

After some helpful people pointed us to the entrance towards the falls we started hiking. It took about 45 minutes to reach the waterfalls and during the walk you will also encounter a smaller fall (a bit further away). The walk can be a bit tough in the heat, especially with little children, so some willingness to hike should be there. What did annoy me was the large number of vendor stands you have to struggle through to reach the falls. The first two are fun to browse through, but the next 25 (with the same merchandise) are a nuisance, mainly because the owners keep offering you their goods. A second thing I did not like was the large amount of monkeys begging for food & people who actually feed the animals so they come back again. And finally, the large amounts of trash all along the trail and near the waterfall. It will be a matter of time before the fall itself will be full of trash. Perhaps the government who runs the maintenance of the falls can use the entrance fee they ask from tourists (which is ten times the local entrance fee!) to keep the place clean so tourists will come back. The positive thing about the falls is that it's a bit undiscovered by tourists. During our hike we did not encounter any tourist, which gives it the feeling of a local attraction, not completely spoiled.","September 7, 2014",0.0,0.0

We took a tuk tuk from Badulla to the start of the trail. The walk was fine in the dry conditions and took around 30 minutes on a well trodden path. I think it'd be quite slippery after rain though! Entrance was 200rps and we had to let a local guy who just started walking with us know we didn't need his help. We came across a shady and slightly unhinged looking police officer on the way back, we couldn't understand what he was saying to us so just smiled and carried on and he left us alone","February 6, 2014",0.0,0.0
