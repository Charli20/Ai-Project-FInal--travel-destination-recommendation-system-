Nestled deep in the hills, it’s full of rustic charm, fresh mountain air, and stunning scenery. Many have described it as having a homely atmosphere, thoughtful touches, and warm hospitality, I couldn’t agree more. For those of us who live most of our lives in concrete jungles, finding a place like this is a rare gift. It is one of those places where you naturally disconnect from devices and distractions and breathe in some of the cleanest oxygen in the region. The peace is almost unreal. The heart and soul of the property is Sid, someone I have known for a long time. With decades of experience and deep knowledge of the Knuckles and its biodiversity, he brings something truly special to the place. His life stories and insights about the region could fill days just listening to him is an experience in itself. The property is hosted by the lovely couple ""Kusume and Sira"", and it feels more like a warm family home than a guest lodge. The accommodation is simple but comfortable and practical. Their home cooked meals were wholesome and satisfying, real Sri Lankan flavours served with care. The climate was just perfect, and the views, especially in the early morning, were absolutely magical. Eagles Crest is also an ideal base for exploring the area serene treks through tea plantations, misty forests, and remote village paths start right at your doorstep. The area is home to some incredible birdlife too, including endemics, something any nature lover will truly appreciate. What made the stay even more meaningful was knowing that by being here, we were supporting the local community. It is not just a place to stay, it is part of something bigger, helping small businesses, encouraging sustainable travel, and contributing to the well-being of the surrounding village. For Anyone Planning to Trek or Stay in the Area If you are planning to stay, hike, or explore the Knuckles region, it’s best to come prepared. The weather can be unpredictable, one minute it’s sunny, the next you are in the middle of mist and rain. Here’s a quick packing list that might help. Shorts & T-shirts Trainers or flip-flops Swim trunks Travel towel Insect repellent Poncho or raincoat (a must especially if hiking) Jumper for cooler evenings Flashlight / head torch Socks / leech socks Any essential medicines (the nearest town can be 30–40 minutes away) You don’t need fancy gear, but a bit of preparation goes a long way in making your time in this remote, beautiful region more comfortable and safe. 🌿 Leave No Trace – Take only memories, leave only footprints. Please carry your trash back and help protect the beauty of Knuckles for future trekkers.","July 5, 2025",0.0,0.0

My journey to this secluded paradise was not just a trek through nature but a soulful voyage into the heart of one of Sri Lanka’s most spectacular landscapes and forest reserves in the Central Region. The adventure began with two of my guests from Colombo. I picked them up in my SUV, and we came to Knuckles Vila By Pila, who owns and manages two log cabins in the woods which is part of the Knuckles Massif. The early morning mist clung to the hills as we made our way through the entrance of an estate, Rangala Kalduriya Division, with our faithful native guide, Dinesh.  It was already raining, and I felt so relaxed and happy as I used to so many years back when I used to go on hikes in the rain. Rain makes me feel fresh and very much less tired. The climb was steep and challenging through the hardly visible nature trail yet incredibly rewarding. Along the way, the trail meandered through thick forests and verdant tea plantations, each turn unveiling a new facet of the region’s vibrant ecosystem. The sounds of chirping birds and the rustle of leaves underfoot became a soothing symphony. The sounds of birds and crickets added a touch of playful melody to the journey. As the trail ascended, cooler air and more dramatic views took over. Majestic peaks rose in the distance, their summits shrouded in a veil of rain clouds and slight mist. The sights were tranquil and the wonders of nature. After about four hours of trekking in the rain, the crescendo of the journey was in sight: Kotaganga Falls. The sight of the waterfall was breathtaking. Crystal-clear waters cascaded down a series of rocky steps, forming natural pools that shimmered invitingly in the semi-sunlight and partial rain. The air was filled with the gushing sound of the falls and the refreshing scent of mist and nature. The falls were a sanctuary, a place where time seemed to stand still, allowing one to bask in the glory of nature's grandeur. Taking a breather and some photos by the waterfall, I felt a profound sense of peace and fulfillment. The journey, with all its trials, had led to this moment of serene beauty. It was glorious. It was a reminder that sometimes, the most beautiful destinations are also the most challenging to reach, and it is the journey itself that shapes our experience. As we began our descent back to the lodge, I carried with me not just the memory of the stunning Kotaganga Falls, but also a renewed appreciation for the wonders that lie hidden within the Knuckles Range. This trek was a testament to the incredible beauty that nature offers, a journey that will remain etched in my heart for years to come. It's definitely an unforgettable experience! :) So here's a note to future travellers: Prepare Physically The trek to Kotaganga Falls can be quite demanding, so it's important to be in good physical condition and mindset. Regular walking, hiking, and stamina-building exercises can help you prepare for the journey. Dress and Gear Waterproof jackets or hoodies, leech socks for those who don't like the leech experience, warm pants if it's hiking in the rainy season, long-sleeve bush shirts or t-shirts to keep your hand from getting scratched from thorns or bushes, all-terrain hiking shoes or boots. Layering is key, as the weather can change quickly in this mountainous region. Pack light but make sure to include essentials such as: A waterproof backpack, plenty of water and snacks, a first aid kit, a flashlight or headlamp, and of course leech repellents like Dettol, salt, and soap mixed spray. Start Early To make the most of your day and avoid the sluggishness, start your trek early in the morning. Sunrise over the Knuckles can be a spectacular sight when not rainy, and the cooler morning temperatures will be more pleasant for hiking. Stay on Marked Trails, Hire a Guide The Knuckles Mountain Range is known for its dense forests and diverse wildlife. Stick to the marked trails to ensure you don’t get lost and to minimize your impact on the environment. Respect Wildlife and Nature This is most important. You’ll come across various flora and fauna during your trek. Admire them from a distance and do not disturb their habitats. Take only photographs, and leave only footprints. Stay Hydrated and Energized Keep yourself well-hydrated and carry enough high-energy snacks to maintain your energy levels throughout the trek. Bananas, nuts, and energy bars are good options. Respect Local Communities Be mindful and respectful of the local communities you may encounter. Learn a few basic phrases in Sinhalese or Tamil as a gesture of goodwill, and be respectful of their customs and traditions. They will always support you when you need any help. Take Your Time The trek is as much about the journey as it is about the destination. Take breaks, soak in the views, and enjoy the serenity of nature. Don’t rush—trekking is a chance to connect with nature and find inner peace. Keep at a moderate speed that you feel comfortable with. Make sure to get back before the evening mist sets in so that you are still able to see the paths. Stay Safe and Informed Check the weather forecast before you go, and be aware of any advisories or warnings. It’s also a good idea to inform someone about your trekking plans and estimated return time. Avoid extreme weather unless you feel you want to take a challenge. Leave No Trace Make sure to carry all your trash back with you and dispose of it properly. Preserve the natural beauty of the trail for future trekkers. Trekking to Kotaganga Falls is an incredible experience filled with breathtaking views, a rejuvination and a deep connection to nature. By following these tips, you can ensure a safe, enjoyable, and memorable adventure. Happy trekking, people!","January 24, 2025",0.0,0.0

We saw very few other tourists all day and had a great time. The weather was mixed for us so we got some views but not all of them. The views we did get were spectacular and would have been even better but for some unfortunate weather. There are multiple hike options so you need to be very careful what you sign up for. This is difficult given the language barrier. We asked for a medium trip and they took this to mean only 2km!! After some arguing we continued on to the waterfalls and all the good bits. Do not let them stop after only a short walk! At the end the man claimed we did a 16km ""long"" trek however our GPS watches both said 10km. For Sri Lanka this is quite expensive as you need a jeep ride to get there and then a guide on the mountains. But it is worth it if you like hiking.

Our guide, the same man as before, did not discover a program for us and kept it in secret, just promised that it wil be more hard and more adventuring. Ok, we accepted the challenge and started 04,01.19. to the absolutely different route than two years ago. It was hard, most for knees, but views from the top were absolutely gorgeous! Rice with pineapple was the best reward for us: it is absolute happiness after exhausting climbing to sit on the stone and watch 360 degrees panorama with clouds floating under us.. . Next we crossed the place called ""Leopard forest"", yes, as real leopards often were seen there. No one leech was detected:) At the end of the day we reached the camp, much better than I expected, even with normal shower and toilet! And it was realy cold at night due to the cloud that descended and covered the valley... After complete breakfast we proceeded slowly to one more observation point, just cross the forest, with no road. It was misterious a bit to find in the heart of mist jungle abandoned Japanese road technics. Strange feeleing, like in a fairy tale...After this walk we finally cought a few leeches from our legs. But we managed to wash and splash in a very clear (with absolutely drinkable water!) stream with the waterfall. Finally, after half day of up-and-down walk, much easier than a day before, through tea plantations and pine tree forest we reached an absolutely bald and clear granite rock, with the view far beyond the horizon. The same evening our guide took us to Hora Bora lake. I will describe the details of this absolutely amazing bird watching at the appropriative article. A few words about our guide: strong former military, skilfull trekker and naturalist, with all the knowledges and proper sertified. He felt that we wanted and was able to change the route to more easy or more adventuring depending our wishes and condition.

We arrived late in the evening and were warmly welcomed by the man running the entire show Mr. Pilapitiya Aka ""Pila"". I couldn't help but notice that the cabin we both spent the night in is quite frankly the most Eco friendly cabin that I've ever seen, everything is either a recyclable or in a form of a raw material. In front of the door itself there is a huge wooden board with a picture of a sketched leopard on it saying ""pila's villa"" (i thought maybe it's a territorial mark perhaps lol) The following morning we were up by 6:00am early in morning preparing for our trek along with a few other tourists that was lead by Haritha Aka harry (pila's son). we were all asked to put on some leech repellent and leech socks to prevent leeches from biting us and so we started our journey. we walked along and around and even in between tea bushes and among the bushes i couldn't help but notice these tiny red berries, it was wild strawberries  (some what a cross between a raspberry and strawberry) it was delicious and we found it almost all through our our trek. we climbed and climbed while taking small breaks in between and soon arrived to some flat land and narrow pathways going down. After a while we heard the sound of water gushing out and after a finally we came to a beautiful waterfall. It was quite breath taking ( you can take a look at the photos below) the water was really cold and i hadn't brought an extra pair of clothes either but i couldn't care less so myself my partner and harry jumped right in and it was literally like having an ice bath but at the same time the most refreshing thing you could do specially after a long climb. After a while we dried off a little bit and headed back down, along the way we were lucky enough to see and hold a ""leaf nose lizard"", the only type of species that could be found in knuckles.Thanks to Harry's timing we were back to the exact point we were asked to come sharp at 1:30pm, we headed back up to pila's camp site and had a marvelous typical sri lankan lunch (consisting of fried aubergine curry, pumpkin kalu pol, chicken curry, beetroot, snake bean curry and a kan kung stir fry) that was prepared by the cook named Siwaguru aka Siva. I coundn't have asked for a better experience than this and i highly recommend any person who loves nature as much as we do to contact by foot adventures for an extraordinary experience.

We wanted to do the knuckles ranges because it is apparently a hidden gem in Sri Lanka. We booked a guide from the hotel we were staying at who took us to the ranges. As it turns out he was not actually a guide but a driver so we had to hire a local guide from the park office (cost 2000lkr). We did the mini world's end hike and the Dothalugala Trail which are both loop hikes with look out points. The mini world's end hike was nice enough and gave some good views, but only took us 45mins to complete. We then decided to tackle the more challenging Dothalugala Trail, a fateful mistake. This trail from the get go was a leech infested nightmare. We were lucky our guide was prepared with some anti leech spray for us which helped, but nothing would totally prevent the onslaught. The 3 hour hike consisted, from then on, of us checking each other every 2 mins for leeches. Some of the views were nice but we were not able to stop for long, or else we would be covered again. There was some wildlife on the hike but nothing too exciting. I am writing this post as a warning mainly, if you want to do this hike, be prepared for the leeches. Leech proof socks is a must!

Four of us decided to do a walk through the Knuckles ranges and struggled to find information about it online. We were put in touch with Nishantha (ph 0779188292) who is a local eco tourism guide. He lives in a small village on the outskirts of Kandy, where they only have phone reception (no email or website). He quoted us $50 usd pp, which we initially thought was expensive, but after finding only one other possible tour which was 18,000 lkr pp ($117 usd) we decided to do it. We are so glad we did! The price included hotel pickup from Kandy, a driver, a guide, lunch and a cup of local tea and the start and end. The guide was eco conscious (everything we took in, we took out) and well educated, having studied Ornithology at university. He was so enthusiastic and passionate and knowledgeable and spoke clear fluent english (bonus!). He could spot animals miles away and carried binoculars for us to use. He was also super patient while I took lots of photos. He reminded me of a Sri Lankan Crocodile Hunter (RIP Steve Irwin). We saw about 50 different bird species, two mongoose, macaques and butterflies, and walked across some incredible scenery, including rice paddy fields, small villages, tea plantations, through large boulders and had a swim in a waterfall. We spoke to locals from the Burnside area and Nishantha provided insight into working in tea plantations and life in rural villages. Lunch was provided, which was a very tasty curry and rice box which we ate at the waterfall. We opted to do the 10km walkthrough, which I would probably rate as a medium difficulty. The guide gave us a few options at the start as there are lots of different routes, and as we were walking, to see if we wanted to summit the mountain or go along the side. I would say to walk around the side because the view is still incredible and the path was a bit easier. I think summiting would have required some bushbashing. We were lucky with the weather. I think it would be a lot more challenging in rain as you walk through rice paddy fields which would probably turn to slush. There were lots of chisled steps out of rocks and walking up and down with the ridgeline in high humidity. Door to door was about 12 hours. I would 100% recommend this place and guide to anyone who wants an eco hike through real Sri Lanka. This will be my highlight of my holiday and will be an experience I remember forever. I strongly recommend it for people of medium/good fitness levels.","October 25, 2017",0.0,0.0

We didn't manage to find that much tourist information online regarding how to travel there, accommodation and potential hikes so I'll try make this review as informative as possible. We were travelling from Kandy and had booked to stay at Welikande Villas, we discovered we could get a tuktuk there for around 2000 rupees, catch a bus to a nearby village, or opt for the 26km walk... As we love trekking we decided to attempt the walk as we could always flag down a tuktuk en route if we were struggling. (There are also buses coming from Matale if you are travelling from there.) The walk started near the lake in Kandy & was through small villages (with friendly locals offering us tea, cake and fruit) and tea plantations. The route is relatively flat, with the elevation just rising towards the last 3-4km. From our hotel there were lovely views of the mountains and Victoria reservoir (it rained heavily for an hour or two, from around 4pm, each day day we were at knuckles mountain range, so try organise your arrival and onward hikes with this in mind). When we arrived at our hotel we discovered there were hiking routes around nearby villages and tea plantations, as well as trips to mini world's end, waterfall tours, and the famous knuckles mountains (in Meemure). For most of these trips you hire a guide who picks you up in a tuktuk in the morning and takes you along the hiking route, pointing out animals, plants and areas of interest (this seemed to be from 30-50 dollars a day, depending on the trip). Or you can have a wander through some of the villages on your own. The air is very fresh, the views are beautifuland all of the people we encountered were so friendly. Would definitely advise to visit this seemingly untouched area of Sri Lanka.","May 12, 2017",0.0,0.0

We reached the guest house around 7 30 pm so could not see any of the surrounding country side, and were shown to our rooms, which are all little individual bungalows with little verandahs set against the hillside... The accommodation is quite simple and no frills, decent linen, a towel rack, our room had 3 single beds, a dresser and little closet. The bathroom had rough stone walls and floors with a water spout as a shower, no hot water though I understand the staff will get you some should you request some. This is extremely cheap accommodation so obviously you are nt expecting anything luxurious but I do feel that the room could have used the benefit of a mop as the floor was pretty dusty, there was even some pellets of dung from a rat or something like it and the bathroom could have used a bit of a scrub! Rustic is fine but unless kept extremely clean is a bit depressing not to mention icky!..we went in March so the weather was fine and just a light sweater for the evenings is recommended as it is a bit chilly at night... there is electricity provided with the aid of a generator until about 10pm, so make sure you have your showers, lay out you PJs and have dinner before then! The dining area is below the rooms and probably not a good idea to take anyone who is a senior citizen unless they are extremely fit as the rough stone steps are quite steep and do take along a good torch oh and flat footwear. Dinner was delicious, Rice , chicken curry and about 5 veggie currys, bananas for dessert... saw about 2 staff members who were absolutely lovely and made you feel right at home... you can take your own alcohol, wine etc as I think they only have soft drinks... The best part of the evening was when the generator was shut down and they lit up candles, the dining area is made of stone as well with a verandah that runs alongside and it was lovely sitting out on the benches provided there and looking at the stars, and what stars they were! You know how in the city you see just a few stars because of the city lights? well, out there because of the complete and total darkness surrounding you the night skies are studded with thousands of stars which is absolutely beautiful, extremely quiet and peaceful as well, all we could hear was the stream below us and some insects having a chat! The morning we were able to have our first glimpse of the countryside surrounding us and it was absolutely beautiful, just surrounded by greenery.... breakfast was good, roti and katta sambol, toast, butter and preserves and eggs cooked to order plus tea or coffee... hiking is strenuous but fun in this area but be ready for the leeches!! there are hundreds of them everywhere... the only advice I can give you is keep your legs free from clothing from the knees down, so roll your pants up if they are long, I would say wear strong sandals if you are just strolling not proper hiking as the leeches are easily seen and can be flicked off before they do any damage, once they get in your socks  shoes or way higher you wont even know they are there! I must have flicked off about 50 in a one hour walk... you could carry a bottle of water mixed with soap and salt, and pour a few drops on them which makes them drop off... this part for us was the only not so enjoyable part of the trip but leeches come with the territory so theres nothing you can do about them...  they were there before us after all!

The range takes its name from a series of recumbent folds and peaks in the west of the massif which resemble the knuckles of clenched fist when viewed from certain locations in the Kandy District.

The entire area is characterised by is often robed in thick layers of cloud. In addition to its aesthetic value the range is of great scientific interest. It is a climatic microcosm of the rest of Sri Lanka as the conditions of all the climatic zones in the country are exhibited in the massif. At higher elevations there is a series of isolated cloud forests, harbouring a variety of flora and fauna, some of which cannot be found anywhere else in the world.[citation needed] Although the range constitutes approximately 0.03% of the island’s total area it is home to a significantly higher proportion of the country’s biodiversity.","March 5, 2016",0.0,0.0

I advise any one to take an experienced tracker with the appropriate equipment if trekking up to the top of the knuckles mountains as you can get lost & there is no mobile phone connection here unless you have a sat phone. To get the maximum I suggest a 4 day trek. I also suggest to take a trekk between January - March. The little pools, streams & thickets on the way up are beaming with life. The view from the top of range in the wee hours of the morning is stunning.  Make sure to take sufficient batteries for your cameras as the batteries run down fast in the cold. There are many beautiful places which an experienced tracker will be able to show you. Ask for photographs of previous trips from your tracker & decide on your trip in advance.

We were initially a little wary as the price seemed fairly high for a day trip exploring the Knuckles mountain range with a guide - yet in comparison to other tours it seemed on parr, and was well worth every dollar spent. Amil the tour guide fetched us at 7am from our hotel, as we embarked on the unknown. I have to admit I was petrified of the leaches and any other creepy crawlies we may find. Driving through the tea gardens, Lake Victoria and the surrounding scenery was too beautiful for words - we stopped for a traditional Sri lankan breakfast in a corner shop - which was too delicious and far too much for my husband or I to even make a dent on! We then drove through the tea plantations, and arrived at the base of the knuckles to begin our trek. The leaches were all that we had heard about, but were really not as big a deal as we expected. Amil and Raja who accompanied us, carried dettol spray which was useful to spray the leaches off - they were a lot smaller than what i had imagined in my nightmares, and although they do get onto your feet, they fall off quite quickly too. My husband got bitten by a few (he was in shorts) while i was in long tights and was fine. the hike is quite long - and 17kms they aren't kidding, but the scenery, endometic wildlife and waterfalls we saw were breathtaking. Take a poncho as when it rains it pours and there is nowhere to hide, as well as suntan lotion as it was surprisingly warm - 4 seasons in one day! They carried up a delicious traditional Sri Lankan curry for lunch, with fresh pineapple, as well as provided dribnking water throughout the day. We absolutely loved every minute of it, the guides were extremely knowledgable, and next time we would consider doing the overnight trek and camping in the cave for the night.","November 30, 2015",0.0,0.0

There are about 36 prominent peaks in Knuckles massif and this is the 2nd highest peak out of them. There are two routes to start the trail. One from Bambarella side and other from Thangappuwa side. These two pathways join just below 1st peak. Both Bambarella and Thangappuwa can be approached by public transport. Few things to be kept in mind in this trekking; Bring enough water as  no water sources after some distance, protection from leeches and unpredictable weather. Most of the time hikers go upto 2nd peak (highest point-1848m) and sometimes they camp at there. I had an experince of climbing all five peaks in one day without camping. In that case you have to start the journey in early morning with light pack. This is a moderate strenous hike it takes about 6 hours to reach the fifth peak from trail head- Bambarella side. There is a clear foot pathway till 2nd peak and trail can be easily traced after this. If you are new for this environment, better have a local guide.","June 6, 2015",0.0,0.0

It was just another traveller and I, with 2 guides. And I liked it that for the full 3 days at the mountain range, I only saw locals who live in the mountains, and NO other travellers.  (A good respite from the Well-beaten tracks in the country). The trek wasn't too challenging, so it's a good scenic walk with nature. You'd sleep in a campsite, with tents prepared for you. There are toilets and shower, but because it was cold at night, I skipped the cold shower. The camp master made good local food too, and were pretty helpful and friendly. Perhaps one thing that would bug you, is the leeches. They're everywhere in the trek, and you will DEFINITELY get them on your shoes. The guides will prepare Dettol solution to pour around your shoes, but it will not totally keep them away, so just be mentally prepared. You'd think it's a big deal when you see the first few leeches on your feet, but soon enough, you'd see so many that you'd sometimes just ignore haha! Well, that's really part of the experience. The summit climb might be a little tiring, but well, do it! Just be prepared for wet weather. Raining in the mountain range is pretty common, and weather changes can be very drastic and fast.

I would say that the experience was mixed, but that mostly owes to us believing that we could just go there and do it. So a few tips for other travellers: -Do get a professional guide. Except for the scenery, this is not the Alps where you have signposts everywhere in the middle of the mountains.  A guide will help you get to the best spots through the best tracks. -Do mind your starting point.  We started from north of Matale; once you get in the hills, the road is narrow, windy and slow - all eating up into your hiking time.  Probably the best places to hike are further down south. If I'd re-do our trip to SL, I would probably forego Horton Plains (maybe even Ella) and spend 1.5 days in the Knuckles, starting from some nice accommodation north-east of Kandy.

The region is a major watershed and several streams and rivers stroll down to feed the giant Mahaweli River. All types of climates that are found in the island could be experienced here.

We walked up one of the big mountains which was quite challenging but the views were definitely worth it! What made it extra special was how deserted it was- it was nice that we were off the main tourist trail. When we went it was relatively dry but i would advise taking leach socks just in case. It is also worth pointing out that the roads are not particularly an easy drive to get there. They are pretty narrow and extremely windy which our driver found pretty tough going in the large minibus style van.

A relatively easy hike up after about half an hour of rough road, you will find yourself surrounded by absolutely beautiful natural scenery: rolling tea plantations, lush green valleys and the gentle peaks of the mountain's 'knuckles' against a backdrop of clear blue sky (which I was lucky to have). The hike takes you through some tea growing fields as you follow the same walking paths trodden by local workers. Canopied walks under trees and brush followed by refreshing respites through the fresh water streams direct from the mountain source (and totally drinkable!). Depending on how far you go, you can see (or at least hear) the roar of distant waterfalls or otherwise take in the silence of being at the heart of nature, with just the buzzing of bees, dragonflies, birds and the wind for company. Camping is highly recommended. Bring a walking stick as some of the step climbing up can be steep (though they weren't many). And make sure to book a guide (US$80 to 100 including car and lunch for day trips), preferably one who has expert knowledge of the local fora and fauna of the area. It will make for a much more interesting journey!","May 12, 2014",0.0,0.0

His name is Kamura Sangha.  He is from Meemure, which is a village in the middle of the Knuckles Forest Reserve, so he was able to take us on a great trek (16 kms) in the Reserve around his village.  We were able to hike thru jungle, tea fields, rice paddies, and water falls where we had an opportunity to swim (but chose to nap instead).  Kumara was an excellent guide and was able to point out the different flora and fauna during our hike. The hike was at a good pace and for a good distance -- and the scenery was breath-taking!  The route we took was not the usual route that the other guides used.  Since this is where Kumara grew up and lives, he took on a circuit where we did not see another tourist for the entire day. The only downside was that it took 2 hours (in a tuk tuk) to get to the trekking starting point from Kandy.  Make sure you depart at the end of the day in enough time to make it back in daylight.  We took our time a bit and went to see an additional waterfall and ended up travelling in the dark.  Not the smartest thing to do in a tuk tuk. Lastly, there were leeches that you had to be on the look out for.  They were not the big,nasty looking ones that were used to bleed people with.  They are small, thin ones that are easy to spot and get rid of.  They really weren't an issue at all.  You just had to be diligent. All in all, it was a great day!  The hike and scenery made up for the tuk tuk travel.","March 3, 2014",0.0,0.0

We discovered that Anil is the owner of Srilanka Ecotrekking (http://www.srilankaecotrekking.com/) and accountant turned fervent biologist and nature lover with a passion for the Knuckles Mountain Range. A couple of days later Anil guided us on a one-day trek of his beloved mountains. We left Kandy just after 6 am and within the hour were on our way up into the unique cloud-cloaked and mist-laden micro environment that Anil calls the ‘pigmy forest”. Our trek took us through tea plantations, forest clearings where henna was being grown, alongside the clearest of bubbling streams, through jungles, past amazing waterfalls, bamboo forests and into the stunted ‘pigmy forest’. Through the mist we caught breath-taking views of majestic mountain peaks and were fortunate enough to see a mongoose, a civet, a porcupine and several birds whose names I do not remember. Anil is not only a lover of this area but is also a font of knowledge. He knows the flora and fauna and history of the area and is personable and friendly without being over-the-top. We did not see any deer, but may?? have caught a glimpse of a leopard. We had a picnic lunch at about 1,800 meters and after an hours rest made our way slowly back to the car where we were treated to a much welcomed cup of tea. Anil’s passion for this unique habitat was obvious. He spoke with passion of the over exploitation of this fragile system and the very visible effects of commercial cultivation of cardamoms and henna. Cardamom are being cultivated under the forest canopy and as Anil explained, the clearing of native undergrowth to undertake this activity is a major contributor to the degradation of the natural environment. We saw first-hand the evidence of invasive exotic species, particularly the ubiquitous lantana (Lantana Camara). The damage being caused by the clearing and burning of the forest to plant henna is also most obvious. My concern is however more for the wide sealed road that will bring bus loads of polluters. See it while it is still relative pristine. Like Everest Base Camp, this will not last.","October 3, 2013",0.0,0.0

It is about 1. 5 hours drive from Kandy. If you leave Colombo before the traffic builds up you can get there easily by 9.30 a m. If not you will end up getting there past noon. (To Deanston end) Make sure you know which side of Knuckles you are going to as the routeis  changes depending on whether it is Deanstone or Riverstone. Corbets View lodge is on Deanstone side and that is also the side to be at for a relatively easier trek to Meemure village. Knuckles is a good site for nature, fauna, flora enthusiasts and similarly interested photographers. It is also wonderful for trekkers and hikers as to here are many treks to choose from soft to hard and also depending on the time you have at hand. You can do easy 2-3 hour treks to half day, or day treks or even longer. There are campsite run by the Wild Life park authorities. You will need to reserve them in adance though. December and January are the rainy season and best avoided. Any other time is good. August/September brings the area strong winds and locals say - there is no winds as those winds! You will notice that most roofs have heavy objects loaded on them to keep the roof from flying away! This is also good for those who just want to relax and rejuvenate. If you hate to trek but just want to spend a quite peaceful holiday sipping tea and reading a book - still Knuckles moutainh as is a place to be.  The air quality is so good - after a couple of days your skin shows it! And dont forget to wake up early to see the sun rise- it is beautiful and a dream for photographers!","January 13, 2013",0.0,0.0

The upper range of the mountain has whats considered to be probably the only pygmy forest in the district. We commenced our climb at around 8.30am and got back to the starting point only around 7.30pm. It was raining during most of the day and we were not fortunate enough to reach the summit. Its a tough climb and you need to be physically fit and adequately equipped. You would also need to take a guide as the route is not marked and you could easily get lost in the myriad of pathways in the forest. There are also several starting points and you could recruit one of the locals from the village for a fee to guide you. However, it would be advisable to obtain some travel agents assistance if you're from overseas as the starting point for these treks are well off the beaten path.

The trip was professionally run. The guide very helpful and friendly. Good food was provided and lots of info about the local area. They brought along spray for the many leeches (beware of these and wear boot if possible) and even provided tooth picks at the end of our lunch. The view from the top was superb. We didnt climb the mountain but still thought it was amazing on the plateau. the one negative was that the climb up by the waterfalls was extremely difficult. We do alot of walking in Australia and I've never encountered a walk like this and found it almost too hard. The track had been cut through the jungle virtually straight up the incline instead of following the contours in places. this resulted in sheer walls to try and climb and it was very slippery with no hand holds as most of the plants gave way when you pulled them. This part of the track lasted a couple of hours and was very difficult so if you arent particularly fit it may be challenging. Mind you I'm not that fit and almost 50 so .....
