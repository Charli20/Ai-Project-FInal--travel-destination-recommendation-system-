Tucked away in a serene and lesser-explored part of Sri Lanka, this ancient circular relic house is a masterpiece of Buddhist architecture and an incredible testament to the island's rich heritage. The site's highlight is its symmetrical design, featuring a central stupa surrounded by finely carved stone pillars and four Buddha statues facing the cardinal directions. The craftsmanship is breathtaking, with intricate carvings and inscriptions that transport you back to a time when spirituality and artistry flourished together. The location adds to its charm – perched on a low hill amidst tranquil surroundings, it feels like stepping into a meditative sanctuary. Unlike the busier sites in Polonnaruwa, Medirigiriya offers peace and an opportunity to explore at your own pace without large crowds. Practical tips: - Wear comfortable shoes, as there’s a bit of walking involved. - Visit in the morning or late afternoon to avoid the midday heat. - Bring water and a hat, as facilities nearby are limited. Overall, Medirigiriya Vatadageya is a hidden gem that deserves more attention. It's perfect for those looking to connect with Sri Lanka's spiritual and historical roots in a tranquil setting. Highly recommended!","December 25, 2024",0.0,0.0

The main feature is the circular temple with pillars and 4 statues of Buddha, wonderfully preserved for being so old. There are several other structures including more Buddha statues and a stupa built on rocks. A bit further up the same premises, there is an ancient hospital - this was adjoining a forest area from which a deer family emerged - a very pleasant surprise! We went on a weekday so there maybe 6 other people in total so we had the whole place to ourselves. The site is charming and serene, with a couple of ponds and the view from the top of the structure very pretty. I believe there is no entrance fee (there wasn't when we went) and there was no parking charge either. But keep in mind, this is a fair bit away from the main sites of Polonnaruwa/Dambulla etc, so it may not be getting a lot of tourists. However, if you have some time, and feel up for a (slightly) off the beaten path trek, this is a charming place to visit. Accessibility wise  -  there are a few steps to climb, but generally an easy visit.","December 20, 2023",0.0,0.0

The Sthupa is built from bricks that are resting on a platform build from stones, and a set of stone pillars that are erected around the sthupa to hold the roof. Today though the roof cannot be seen, the pillars and the platform is still intact, whilst the sthupa is deteriorated, to a mound. In addition to the main sthupa, one has the opportunity of walking in the vast surrounding where you may see few smaller sthupa. It is recommended that one should visit the attraction early morning or late afternoon, since during the day time walking around the sthupa and the platform with no shoes is not of comfort with the stone heating up for the sun.
