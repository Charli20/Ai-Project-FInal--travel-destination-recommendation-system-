A beautiful monument in the heart of Polonnaruwa, Sri Lanka.",5,Solo,"One of the main reasons I include Polonnaruwa in the itinerary of a Sri Lankan Holiday is to visit the ancient carvings of Lord Buddha at Gal Vihara, Polonnaruwa, Sri Lanka. It is believed that , during war times, the entire complex was covered in sand to protect it from marauding  enemy armies. The intricately carved statutes of Lord Buddha ( which is disputed by some learned pundits) is a visual treat for the eyes. The monument is now provided with a roof to protect it from the elements. However, it is disheartening to see  one of the forearm of the reclining Buddha statue has been broken. It is suggested that a separate manned shoe stand may be provided for the convenience of the pilgrims and the visitors at Gal Vihara entrance. A must visit while you are in Sri Lanka. Highly recommended.","September 29, 2025",0.0,0.0

It’s hard to describe how impressive this place is until you’re standing in front of it. The site features four massive Buddha statues, all carved directly into a single granite rock face over 800 years ago. There’s a reclining Buddha, a seated Buddha, and a standing Buddha—each one full of delicate details. The size and serenity of the statues left me speechless. Even though they’re so big, there’s such a calm, peaceful energy here. It felt like time slowed down while I stood there, taking it all in. I noticed that parts of the carvings are still incredibly sharp, while other areas have softened a bit with time. It’s amazing how skilled the artists were so many centuries ago. Gal Viharaya is definitely a must-see if you’re in Polonnaruwa. It’s not just a historical site—it’s a place that touches your soul. Tip: Go early in the day for softer light, fewer people, and a more peaceful experience.","July 10, 2025",0.0,0.0

As your guide, I’m excited to share the fascinating history and spiritual significance of this remarkable site. Gal Viharaya, built by King Parakramabahu the Great in the 12th century, is renowned for its four beautifully crafted Buddha statues, all carved out of a single granite rock face. Each statue represents a different posture of the Buddha—standing, seated, and reclining—offering visitors a profound spiritual experience. First, let’s admire the seated Buddha, placed in deep meditation. The detail in the carving, particularly in the robe's folds and the serene expression on the Buddha’s face, reflects the artistic mastery of the time. Moving on, the standing Buddha is unique, with its arms crossed over the chest, symbolizing deep sorrow or contemplation. This posture is not commonly seen in other Buddha statues, making it especially intriguing. The most iconic statue here is the reclining Buddha, which represents the Buddha’s passing into Nirvana. The calm and peaceful expression on the Buddha’s face, along with the finely carved features of the body, showcase the skill and devotion of the ancient artisans. Notice how the pillow beneath the Buddha’s head is delicately crafted to appear soft, with indentations from the weight of the head—a remarkable detail carved entirely in stone. What makes Gal Viharaya so special is not just the artistic brilliance but also the peaceful, spiritual atmosphere of the site. Surrounded by the ancient ruins of Polonnaruwa, the statues evoke a sense of timelessness and reverence, making this a truly immersive experience for visitors. As we explore these statues, I encourage you to take in not only their beauty but also the deep sense of tranquility that surrounds them. For those interested in history, art, or spirituality, Gal Viharaya is a must-visit destination, offering a glimpse into the skill and devotion of Sri Lanka’s ancient craftsmen. I hope this visit leaves you with a deep appreciation for the incredible history and cultural heritage of Sri Lanka!","September 24, 2024",0.0,0.0

You need to have covered your knees to enter the place. If you don't the stuff will force some big scarf on you and you will pay a small fee and a donation to the place afterwards. You also need to enter the place barefoot so your shoes will be left out at the entrance, behind the fence. I liked the small branches put under the giant rocks at the place. It's not a part of the place itself, but it's something that people do in a symbolic way to get a support in a time of need in their life. It's not possible to take the pictures of the place when you are behind the entrance point, since it's not polite to stand with your back towards Buddha. But it's possible to take the pictures of the place when you are behind the small fence that surrounds the place. Everybody does that and at the same time, the people working at the place don't mind. Because of that, the regulation not to take pictures of the place don't make much sense to me.

I was under the impression that this particular area wasn’t sacred and forgot to bring a sarong to tie around my waist, which limited me from a few things. Frustrating, as there are no signs anywhere and nothing on their brochure about this.  I also wasn’t alerted while shelling out the $25 US for my ticket. I usually come prepared and in this case, it was my own fault. That said, the sites are interesting, but you really need to come prepared with a guide or hire someone to take you around.

The site itself is located in a picturesque and peaceful corner of the vast Polonnaruwa ruins, reached after you have toured the other temples and stupas on the site. Despite the crowds of visitors, it is at once intensely serene and peaceful,  and one can see why this spot was chosen to carve into the living rock  three representations of the Lord Buddha - one sitting, one standing , and one lying down. Of these three however, the most intriguing is the standing Buddha,  which for some strange (and still today unexplained) reason, has his hands crossed on his chest in a very non-Buddhist fashion, more akin to the pose adopted  by the ancient Egyptians in their mummified form..... it's a complete mystery why this pose was adopted, and is, I think, unique in Buddhist idolatry. Intriguing or what?....   (Top tip - Despite the site being from the 12th century, it is still regarded as ""holy"", so you must remove your shoes to visit.

We didn't mind that too much as from what I can see all the money goes to conservation. (The locals pay less that 1 Dollar) We walked passed the other ruins and as we came to the entrance of Gal Vihara the security guards wanted to see all Foreigners tickets while the locals just walked passed us without any issue. As I had the tickets in my backpack and as I was also carrying my 17 month old child who was asleep at that time, I asked them if it's really necessary as there is no way could any foreigner enter the site without showing the tickets in the entrance of the ruins.  I pointed out I need to remove my backpack to take it out and they were adamant they had to see it. There was no sympathy shown for the fact we had a child and they wouldn't let us go until we had to go through our bags and produce the tickets. They also had the audacity to tell us only one of us can go as one of the tickets were missing a stub that they need to tear off. Having only seen very friendly locals so far, my French wife was appalled at what they were saying and even though I was conversing in Singhala they were adamant they had to see both stubs on the tickets. Finally after threatening to go to the papers they let us in but by then the whole experience was lost on us and we just wanted to head back. So my advise for all tourists, be prepared to be treated like money making machines and be prepared to be discriminated as you will see the locals walking around with no issues while the security guards have been instructed to check tickets of tourists on every entrance.

The immense statues are carved into an enormous block of granite. The statue complex includes one amazing shrine to Buddha inset into the rock by two metres or so with a Buddha statue inside all carved frim the same block. Unbelievable craftsmanship. There are huge Buddha's standing either side also built into the rock. One has his arms crossed which is an usual pose, according to our guide, to express sympathy with us all for how bad the world can be and how much hardship there is. To the extreme right is an enormous reclining Buddha and like the rest of the statues, the detail is mesmerising. You can see the grain of the granite running across all the statues as they are all cut from the same body of rock. There is a canopy to shelter you from the sun but wear socks as the rocks can be baked red hot and you must remove your shoes. Cover the knees and shoulders or you won't be admitted.

They depict great craftsmanship of the ancient Sri Lanka. The fabulous stone carvings are within the Polonnawara complex, which itself is huge.  The fee is US$ 25 and SAARC country citizens get 50% discount on producing their passports. This is the most visited area of the archaeological area, with many locals offering flowers to the Buddhas.  There are many ruins and ancient structures, which are utterly fabulous. The Gal Vihara originally as the Uttararama, is a rock temple of the Buddha situated in the ancient city of Polonnaruwa, Sri Lanka, as fashioned in the 12th century by Parakramabahu I. There are 4 Buddha statues, carved from granite. The standing Buddha is the most amazing statue I have ever see. It stands about 40 feet, and shows the Buddha with a free cloak coming way from the body. There is also featuring a huge reclining Buddha. This part of Polonnaruwa archaeological site and you need transport to get around the park. The old city of Polonnaruwa can be a long drag at the end of the day but these Buddha's were well worth the effort. It would have been nice to have been able to sit here.  You have to walk about 500 meters from the vehicle park to the Gal Vihara. Recently they have constructed a roof to protect the statues. Higher roof would have been better but glad to see some preservation work is ongoing. It is impressive andhave to  be aware of dressing appropriately and not taking pictures. No selfies either. One lady tried to do a selfie of a Buddha and her. Police rushed over. She had to leave. One can't take a photo with the back turned to Buddha. It was amazing to see how the Statue was carved on the stone. People who are interested in arts and culture should visit.

The main feature of Gal Vihara is the four images of the Buddha that have been carved on a single, large granite rock face .[ Three of the images are quite large; the smallest of them is more than 15 feet (4.6 m) tall, and the largest is more than 46 feet (14 m) long. However, the fourth image is just over 4 feet (1.2 m) and located inside an artificial cavern carved into the rock. The standing Buddha is 7 m tall and is said to be the finest of the series, with its unusual position of the arms and sad facial expression. The reclining Buddha is 14 m long, picturing Buddha entering Nirvana. You must not miss this area within your tour, very significant. This is another place where you can see the majestic work done by the Sri Lankan stone carvers in the by gone era.

Crafted during the reign of King Parakrabahu (1153-1186 A.C), Gal Vihara statues are still in complete preservation with their irresistible charm and sublimity. It is undeniable that the sculptors of Gal Vihara were of greater skill and expertise in the art of stone sculpture in Sri Lanka. The images at Gal Vihara have brought about higher level of awakening in the observers with respect of Buddhist art in Sri Lanka. Gal Vihara at Polonnaruwa in Sri Lanka known as “The Northern Temple” in the beginning of its history, is a cave complex, about 27 meters in length and 10 meters in height at the centre and sloping towards the ends, with sculptures carved on the solid rock in four shrines. Gal Vihara, like numerous other Buddhist shrines of Sri Lanka, is a shrine of Theravada Buddhism. Then again Gal Vihara testifies to the influence of Mahayana Buddhism during the 12th century. Caves of Gal Vihara Gal Vihara consists of four cave shrines with sculptures hallowed out of a granite rock.Caves from left to right are (a) Cave of Vijjadharas, (b) Excavated Cave, (c) Cave of Standing Image and (d) Cave of Reclining Image. Between the Excavated Cave and the Cave of Standing Image is an inscription. In front of the Excavated Cave are remains of a pavilion. Though the brick walls of the four shrines had collapsed centuries ago, the foundations remain giving evidence that each statue was separated from one another. Cave of Vijjadharas The cave consists of a main image of Buddha sculpted out of the rock boulder, having carved round and four small bas relief carvings of Buddha. The small bas relief statues are carved on either sides, above the head of the main image. The main image depicts the chief of meditative Buddhas titled Dharmadhatu, Adi Buddha, Vairocana and Vajrasattva. The four small images of the Buddha in Dhayani Mudra represent the four directions of the universe. All five images are of Dhyana Mudra or meditative posture is believed to depict the all embracing Body of Law (Dharmakaya). The Excavated Cave The Excavated cave too houses an image of Buddha in dhayana mudra or meditative attitude sculpted out of the rock boulder. The image herein is smaller than the main image at Vijjadhara Cave. The Cave of Standing Image The Buddha statue rising to 7 meters in height herein, stands on a lotus pedestal called Padmasana. Padmasana signifies that Buddha is a transcendental being. The Cave of Standing image: Ananda or Buddha The standing statue is at the head of the massive reclining Buddha. The standing statue’s placing of arms across the breast has caused a controversy as to the identity of the statue. The early archeologists believed the statue was that of Ananda, an attendant disciple of Buddha grieving at the passing away of Buddha. However, the subsequent studies at Gal Vihara on the features of the statue have established that the standing image is that of Buddha and not of his disciple Ananda. Firstly, since the standing image was once contained in its own shrine room, separated by brick walls it has no relevance to the reclining image. Though the brick walls of the three caves had collapsed several centuries ago, the foundations can still be seen. Secondly, the right-ward curled clusters of hair are only found on the images of the Buddha and not on the images of his disciples in the same period. Thirdly, the Buddhist artists never offered the Lotus throne or Padmasana to disciples Fourthly, the ears of the statue herein are elongated. Of all the statues of Buddha, his disciples and deities, only the images of Buddhas consist of elongated ears.","January 6, 2017",0.0,0.0

He said the reclining buddha is in a state of perinirvana, as indicated by the left foot being slightly behind the right - i.e. it is not merely sleeping or lying down. He told us there is some discussion as to whether the standing buddha is actually a depiction of buddha or a monk in mourning, as it may be older than the other three images. He also guided us to walk right up to the wire fence in front of the second buddha (the only one behind a fence) to see the cave paintings, which we'd never have noticed had he not informed us.

The ground is loose coarse sand and grit and visitors can only approach closely by removing hats and footware, though a reasonable photo can be obtained without entering the roped off area.

To the left of the standing figure take note of the apparently smooth and slightly inclined rock face.

Three are definitely of Buddha; they are massive and beautifully carved. If you enter the site itself (it is a sacred place so take your shoes off) you can get quite close and see the exquisite detail in the carving. This is in my view best on the reclining statue where the marbling effect of the rock is fantastic. This particular statue is superb. Our Buddhist guide told us to look for the position of the feet. If the toes are even this shows Buddha resting. The one at Gal Vihara has the toes of one foot slightly forward which denotes the statue represents Buddha at the time of his death and entering Nirvana. The facial expressions on these statues are simple but like nothing else I've seen. Yes, there are some barriers and a canopy. They don't spoil the place, it needs protecting and it is sacred to Buddhists. Two points to note - the ground in front of the statues gets extremely hot. Socks would be an idea. The place is also frequented by two types of monkey who are used to humans and unfortunately expect to be fed by them. The macaques in particular can get aggressive so be careful. The other types are langurs which are light coloured with dark faces.","July 26, 2014",0.0,0.0

The Buddha statues are carved in stone and they depict the virtues of Buddha perfectly well despite the fact that the statues are made of stone. The name ""gal vihara"" means stone temple. Probably this name has been given to this place because everything has been done with or on stones. It is such a beautiful place to visit to see the talents of ancient sinhalese artists. This is also a good way of understanding the reverence that the Sri Lankans have towards Lord Buddha and his teachings. All these things have been done during the times of the ancient kings of Sri Lanka. From those days there has been a rule of governance stating that the King who rules the country should give the foremost place to Buddhism as it is believed that Lord Buddha visited the country thrice during his lifetime in order to help people solve their problems. This is probably the reason why the Sri Lankan constitution also states that the foremost place should be given to Buddhism. But this has in no way been used to undermine the other religions. It is better if foreigners visit this place in the early hours of the morning or after 3 p.m. That is because this place gets really hot during the midday and some people find it really difficult to walk in this place without their footwear. You will have to take your footwear off because it is a religious place and it is believed to be a sign of disrespect if you wear shoes or slippers. I cannot remember whether you have to be in long white clothes to go to this place but I think it would be better if you go to this place wearing decent clothes. I would advise foreigners who want to visit this place to avoid this place during midday unless you want to have blisters on your feet.","December 1, 2012",0.0,0.0
