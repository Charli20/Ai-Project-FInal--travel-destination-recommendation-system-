A lot of the roads still had landslides from the cyclone a few weeks prior so it was slow going.  Lunch was buffet style and was LKR2,950 per person. We enjoyed the Sri Lankan curry items and the fruit.  À la carte was only a little cheaper but western food and we didn't believe they would do this well. Second we went on a tour of the yea factory and plantation.  My wife was given some garb to dress up as a tea leaf picker; a nice little touch for the photo opp later.  You get about 10 mins to take photos in the plantation alongside other tea leaf pickers.  Do not take photo with them as they will expect you to pay them.  The lady guiding us had very good English and recited her speech to us.  We asked questions and she handled them well so she did have more than a cursory knowledge. Finally, you have a tea tasting.  Only the black teas are free.  We ordered the silver tip and golden tip teas and these cost about LKR350 each.  Before we left, we went into the shop to buy some souvenirs.  It's not particularly cheap even compared to Hong Kong where we came from but we're not coming back so it's fine.","December 16, 2025",0.0,0.0

There was a lot of confusion throughout the tour that spoilt the experience for us . The hero they provided was soaked in overnight rain water and the staff just look at each other wondering what to do, it was the initiative of our private driver who cleaned the seats before we got into their jeep . They brought us on a 1.5hour tour in the plantation that allowed us to see the tea fields, the housing where their workers stay , and 3 stops- over a bridge over a fast flowing river, a view of the rampoda waterfall , and a 360 degree view of their plantation and factory before they brought us back to the main area . We were board on the jeep . Thereafter, they did not know what to do with us and asked us what we wanted to do !! We mentioned tea tasting and they dumped 10 samples of tea on our table and asked us to taste them with weird labels on them . We asked them what these tea and labels were and the staff mentioned that it was not her job to explain what they were and the tea tour experience would informed us about the type and grade of tea . Hen we informed her that we had not taken the tour , then only she went into a detailed explanation of what the type of tea they were . However her body posture and demeanour basically informed us that she was just waiting to end our interaction with us . We decided henceforth not to buy any products from the tea company . The factory tour was interesting and was quite decent . They also forget to get us dressed and to pluck tea leaves . From this experience, we decided that it is not worth visiting this tea company . Should you visit any tea plantation, just take a tea factory tour, sip some tea and eat some cakes and move on at least for bluebell tea factory , not worth the visit .","September 10, 2025",0.0,0.0

But I am glad to have done it and can really recommend it. The whole trip is worthwhile due to the beautiful and lush green surroundings. Endless mountains and tea plantations in the mist, I really enjoyed it! When you reach the factory, you get a wonderful tea smell that I couldn't get enough of! The tour of the factory and the great explanation in English I found very interesting, learned a lot of new things about tea that I had not known before. The subsequent visit to the café for tasting as well as the shop was absolutely voluntary, as in any other shop in the city you can decide for yourself if you go in at all or buy something inside. Cannot understand these evaluations along these lines. At no point did anyone try to push you or sell anything. I enjoyed several types of tea and an excellent cinnamon roll (and two more for the way ;)) and bought two types of tea in the shop as a gift for home. Yes, the prices were a bit high for Sri Lanka, that is true. I don't know if the same varieties are available at different prices in the local supermarket.

So we were really pleased that our trip included a stop over here. Obviously there are lots of tea factories all over Sri Lanka, and we only visited this one, so cannot compare to any others, but I assume they are all very similar. The tour takes you round the tea processing factory, as they explain the various stages of processing and different types of tea, and includes a cup of tea afterwards in the nice looking restaurant. There is also the obligatory shop to purchase the vast number of teas from, much of which seemed a little high in price considering they made it on the premises (?). The teas in the fancy packaging seemed quite expensive and we felt it was a bit of a tourist rip-off, so we bought some of the cheaper variety to take home as a souvenir ! The whole thing took approximately one hour, which is just about right. I was a bit disappointed that this  didn't  include a tour of the actual tea fields which surround and rise up into the hills around the tea factory. However....  If you ask nicely then the tour guide will let you take a sneaky detour round the back into the plantation fields, where you can take photos of the tea and also some of the tea pickers - who will gladly pose for the photos if you give them some Sri Lanken Rupees (LRK) tips ! Whilst we enjoyed the experience, we felt saddened and astonished when we saw and found out about the quality of life and working conditions the workers were still enduring in the 21st Century. None of them seemed to have any protective equipment, ear defenders, goggles, hard hats... despite working around noisy, fast moving and potentially dangerous looking machinery. Many of them were not even wearing shoes !!!! Apparently the tea pickers earn something like just 500 rupees, which is just over £2, per day. And in return for this, they get very hard and rough skin on their hands from picking the leaves all day. Not the best life to live, is it ?! So if you visit here and they do pose for photos, please be generous and give them a tip !  If just 2 tourists give them just  £1  tip for some photos, then that doubles their daily wage !","April 18, 2019",0.0,0.0

We met our guide who knows a few Chinese and explained the process pretty clearly, though the whole visit lasted no longer than 15min. They then take you to a tea tasting section which you can enjoy a free cup of BOPF (kind of 2nd-but-last grade for tea bags. Noted we we to Damro later for tea and they claimed to use BOP which is 1 grade higher). The price of tea there is indeed 3 times more than what you can find in the supermarket or central markets (like in Nuwara Eliya and Kandy). Strangely they will tell you within the same grade the tea inside the packages are the same, but prices do varies a lot with different packages... What I learnt is that bigger brands like Lipton, Dimah, Mackswood are all sourcing teas from this tea garden partially so you can say what you buy out in the market also have no big difference in quality. What we don't really like about the place though, is the garden. We took a walk around and 1 old man approached us with a bunch of freshly picked tea leaves. Right next to him was another woman. They were not actually working, no sack no tools... They just ask you to take pictures of them and expect you to pay. Worst of all, after we gave them each 20Rs they are not happy with the amount and asked for more. If you really want to see the working tea puckers go to Pedro or Damro where you have better views and real puckers. Maybe because nowadays fewer people visit Pedro , I found the tea puckers so much more authentic and friendly than this one. They don't ask for tips. And when they receive some, I can see the real appreciation in their eyes. We ended up shooting nothing of the tea puckers in BlueField. Maybe also ask your guide or driver to see if they know that which parts of gardens have finished tea picking.","December 15, 2018",0.0,0.0

At the tea factory we were greeted by our guide, Dinusha Maduwanthi. She was superb at her job! She took us around the factory, while giving us an insight to the tea making process. Dinusha then walked us through the plantations. For city dwellers like ourselves, this was a totally  different experience! Post the tour, visitors are treated to free tea. P. S. only the black tea is free. I tried the Silvertips Tea, which they refer to as ""White Tea"". Unfortunately it didn't taste any different, from regular tea & was not worth LKR 180. Otherwise our visit at Bluefields was lovely! Entry Fee: Nil Best time to visit: Morning - as you get a chance to see the tea pickers work P. S. Wear sport shoes","May 1, 2018",0.0,0.0

I went on a Sunday so the factory wasn't processing but it was very interesting to walk around and learn about how tea is processed from being picked all the way to being bagged up for auction. It's simple and educational, at the end of the day it's a working factory and you're learning about how it works. It's followed by a cup of tea (and cake if you like) in the cafe, and you can walk through to the shop and buy tea at their factory prices. There are staff in the shop (who do the tours) who will talk you through the differences of the types of tea leaves and how best to drink them. I was there about an hour for the whole thing.

The factory was so clean and the tour was excellent. Shop was very good. We bought some tea to take home. Best part of my story was we left a jacket/coat there and were miles away before we realised this. We gave them a call, and they were so helpful. They sent us a picture to confirm, and then sent the jacket to their store in Colombo, for us to collect before leaving Sri Lanka.

Being an avid tea drinker, I along with my family was eager to learn the process of the tea production at the fundamental level from a tea factory. While inside the factory the guide started off by relating the history of the Bluefield tea estate and general overall process of the stages of the step by step production that it undergoes, from the picking of the tea leaves to finally to the point where it is sold at the main auction in Colombo and London. The guide was very accommodating and receptive to our many inquiries, especially my kids who had numerous questions and was awed at the some of the menial tasks required. Most importantly the guide was able to differentiate the quality of the tea that is produced, elevation dependent and provide us with a detailed breakdown of the types and kinds of tea, which is imperative and useful information for the casual tea drinker in order to be able to distinguish fine tea from the not so fine tea. Finally at the conclusion of the tour the guide pointed us in the direction of the tea store and the café, where we informed we can help ourselves to a complimentary cup of tea. While inside the boutiques I approached the tea counter to request a cup of tea and some pastries upon which I a politely told by the counterperson to take a seat in the front lobby and they would bring the items to our table. Promptly our family was served a fabulous cup of tea and some fine pastries to go along with it, the butter cake is fabulous and my favorite was the spicy seeni symbol filled bun. I did also purchased some tea in the boutique as my decision to buy more than I initially planned was influenced by the tea that I consumed at the factory. The boutique is well stocked and does have a broad selection of the types of tea that was covered and explained in our tour earlier. It was an educational and fun experience and I learned quite a bit about tea production from a factory perspective and I am quite certain that I will have a more appreciation and admiration the next time I enjoy my tea.","December 31, 2016",0.0,0.0

This is a common disappointment, so you either plan to come on a good day or expect to miss out on certain aspects of the tea factory tour. We snagged a guide within seconds of asking a manager. The guide gave us a perfunctory tour with superficial explanation of how the factory works. They do these tours dozens of times a day, so don't expect an impassioned treatise on tea with in-depth soliloquies from your guide. This was the first of two major tea estates we visited on this day. Although the machines were not running, we were not allowed to take photos inside (Mackwoods, the other estate we visited, did allow photography inside the factory). The guide dropped us in front of the cafe exactly five minutes after the tour started. His body language indicated that he wanted a tip which, when offered, prompted him to tell us about the free (single-cup) tea tasting at the cafeteria. Don't expect the servers to tell you anything about the tea (we asked and found out that they served BOP - broken orange pekoe, standard black tea). We ordered the Swiss chocolate roll and the coconut cake, both of which were delicious. We didn't feel like they were trying to sell us anything because they didn't drop us off at the store. But the tea store at Bluefield was far, far better stocked compared to Mackwoods during our visit. Mackwoods had only two or three kinds of black tea, whereas Bluefield had dozens of types in different sizes and packages and for different prices...which are quite high, but we loaded up anyway because of the boutique value of the products, which make good souvenirs for loved ones. Overall, the jury is out about which tea estate is better, but despite its more modest tea store, Mackwoods offers better views of the hills and tea plantations around it.","December 28, 2016",0.0,0.0
