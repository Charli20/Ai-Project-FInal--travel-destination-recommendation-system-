The garden is beautifully laid out with a variety of flowers, tall trees, and greenery that creates a calm and refreshing atmosphere. The rain made it difficult to take clear photos and I couldn’t explore the plantation area properly, but it also added a quiet charm — the sound of raindrops among the flowers was very peaceful. The entrance fee for foreign adults was about LKR 3,000, which I felt was reasonable for the beauty you get. Hakgala is perfect for anyone who enjoys nature, gardens, and a calm escape from the busy town. I would recommend visiting on a clearer day to really appreciate the colors and views, but even in the rain it was memorable. Tip: Wear comfortable shoes, as paths can be slippery in wet weather, and bring an umbrella if you visit during rainy season.","September 16, 2025",0.0,0.0

Even though the school teachers say it's an educational trip, it's a really a fun trip for us. One day we took abus to cold Nuwara Eliya with my friends. We sang and danced until we reached the tourist spots, but after getting of the bus, we made sure to preserve the school's reputation. The first stop on the trip is the Peradeniya Botanic Garden. There was a special reasonto choose the botanical garden. It's a "" landscaping "" lesson. We looked closely at the different methods plants were grown on a large scale. Whatever the plants, it was beautifully cultivated to a certain patters. The next stop was the "" Adisham Bungalow"" in Bandarawela, Badulla.  It is a flower garden in the fullest sense of the word. The eyes are unbelievably pink. Surrounding plne plants. Phineas is a plant that i reallt love, even if it's meaningless. Finally we entered Hakgala park. Many foreign tourists also came to seeit. As the day was coming to an end, I bega to feel the coolness of the environment. I walked around the garden and saw the beauty of the flowers and palnts and did not forget to take photos with my friends in the evening, everyone gathered in one place and the other school friends sang ang danced in the garden. The teachers looked at me with a smile and i went to one side and applauded and sang school time is the foundation of the future life. There is no doubt that the experience gained through it will never be forgotten.","January 24, 2022",0.0,0.0

It was once the pleasure garden of Ravana of the Ramayana epic and according to many, it was one of the places where the beautiful Sitha was hidden by the demon King Ravana. The present botanic gardens were founded in 1860 by the eminent British botanist Dr. G.H.K. Thwaites who was superintendent of the Peradeniya Gardens. The Garden consists of an outstanding collection of fauna and flora.","August 20, 2018",0.0,0.0

Worst - Few thugs like people will scavenge for plastics at the gate and remove all before you enter saying need to be environment friendly. But they provide paper bags to use. When you go inside there are no litter bins at all in the places they are needed. Why don't they provide litter bins and avoid hassle at the gate to tourists ? May be because that's their own way. Staff at the entrance and ticket hall are all with see it or leave it attitude. If you are foreigner, they will strip you with Rs 2500 ticket compared to Rs 60 locals ticket. But there are even no basic facilities like usable toilets [so don't expect toilets with tissues]. However being a foreigner has advantage that you can carry plastics without interrogation at the gate. So that's the plus point for a foreigner. Travellers Tip for Foreigners - If any issues, just keep on talking in your language. So the staff will indeed back-off. Tested successfully.

The seasons fall in April and in August. During the month of April, the peak of visitors does come to the gardens as well as the city Nuwara Eliya. If one does not want to be among much crowed then one must visit within the following month and not more than that. The garden comprises of many blooming plants as well as many giant trees. If you are really in to nature, then I would recommend that you do allocate a full day to cover the entire garden and be mesmerized not only with the beauty of the plants within, but with the span of the horizon that can be seen from the garden, and how the weather conditions change, with a moment of mist, and moment of no mist. Apart from plants and trees, if any one is interested and has enough patients then the gardens I believe would be a treasure trove for those who love fauna as well as flora. I personally did see many butterflies, birds and two different types of monkeys. If you are a photography enthusiast, and then have the equipment right, then you would be able to take many photos of birds, butterflies, monkeys, flowers as well as macro shots (if you really in to it). Whilst my stroll in the garden I did notice that the garden has a bungalow facility that can be booked through the Peradeniya Botanical Gardens. I am unable to comment on the condition of the place as at the time of my visit they did have some visitors, and i did not like to disturb them.","June 6, 2017",0.0,0.0

Hakgala Botanical Garden is situated on the Nuwara Eliya-Badulla main road, 16 km from Nuwara Eliya. Hakgala Botanic Gardens, about 28 hectares in extent, lie under the shadow of the Hakgala Rock. The garden was established in 1861, under George Henry Kendrick  as an experimental cultivation of Cinchona, a comercial crop thriving at the time. Once after the Tea replaced the Cinchona, it was turned into an experimental Tea cultivation. In 1884 it transformed to a garden. Since then many sub tropical and some temperate plants were planted in the gardens. The Botanic Gardens are locally reputed for their collection, the rose garden, Magnificent trees, indoor plants, flowers. The climate of the Gardens is subtropical, cool and freshThere are over 10,000 species of flora planted here. However USD 12.5 for SARC coumtries and USD 25.00 per person for a foreigner is bit expensive.","March 17, 2017",0.0,0.0

It was planting season so it wasn't as colorful as it should be but still it was wonderful going through the various gardens. Several paths lead to different areas and all are worth exploring. We really loved walking through one particular narrow path that went through trees and felt as if we were in a forest. With nobody else around, we just had so much fun. As the light faded we started looking for the way back but got lost. We didn't panic though and enjoyed our search for the exit. The management should add exit signs in some of the remote places to guide visitors because there is only one entrance/exit and these Botanic Gardens are spread over an enormous area.","March 8, 2017",0.0,0.0

The area is vast so it gets pretty tiring to see the entire place also after some time the plants and tress look pretty monotonous... If you would lie to see each and every spot then it is better that you spend a little more and make use of the internal transport system.

It is located about 30minutes from Nuwara Eliya town. This botanical garden is spread across hectres of hilly terrains and beautifully maintained. The entering price is quite steep for tourist (1100Lakhs per person) as compared to locals (50Lakhs). It is not as magnificent as those botanical garden in some part of the world that I have been but it has numerous type of plants, ranging from medicinal plants, cold climate colorful flowers and very old aged mature trees. Due to its large area, the stroll can be quite tiring especially when we walked along the small rocky paths. If you need to get a buggy however, it is available at 1000Lakhs per hour but the number of buggy is very limited. My mom and her friend waited almost 1 hour for any available buggy but failed. There are upper gardens and lower gardens. We lost track of our whereabouts but we first encountered Rose Garden. Since it is May and it is spring, there are many blossom colourful roses. Red (definitely), pink, white, blue, yellow etc. The Japanese garden is nothing to shout about with its water features and some unimpressive bonsai. Probably can skip it if you are not up for a long uphill stroll. This place is a good diversion of the busy Nuwara Eliya town but it comes with high price and the garden is not really spectacular. It is still a good place for relaxing stroll with family, but definitely not for those with weak knees or legs.
