But it was well worth it. It is a beautiful temple inside and out with most of the praying happening outside around the Buddhas under the huge tree. The carvings and paintings were impressive and showcase what the Sri Lankan people are capable of. Remember to take off your shoes as it would be hugely disrespectful not to.  There's no one telling you where to take your shoes off but you'll see sandals and shoes just before you reach the square housing the temple.,"December 21, 2025",0.0,0.0

Lord Budhdha's second visit to Nagadeepaya, Sri Lanka was in the fifth year of enlightenment to settle a dispute between two Naga Kings, Chulodara and Mahodara over the possession of a Gem Studded throne. After having listened to the Dhamma sermons by Buddha the Naga kings paid homage to Buddha with overwhelming faith and the throne was offered to Lord Buddha by two Naga kings. The throne was then presented to Naga King Maniakkika- Ruler of Kelaniya by Lord Budhdha as he pleaded for a souvenir to worship. King Maniakkika in turn constructed a Cetiya (Stupa) covering the Gem studded Throne in Kelaniya for thousands of devotees to worship and invited lord Budhdha to visit the holy site. Lord Buddha together with 500 Arahats (Supremely enlightened beings) visited Kelaniya and preached Dhamma, on Wesak Poya Day, after eighth year of enlightenment as Lord Budhdha .It was lord Buddha's third and final visit to Sri Lanka. “The sin of a life time are all rendered null, Once Kelaniya is worshiped a single time""","May 26, 2021",0.0,0.0

As Lord Rama was in exile for 14 years, could not take part in any coronation ceremony, deputed his younger brother Prince Lakshmana to crown Vibeeshana. Today in this very place a Buddhist shrine and a temple for king Vibeeshana exist. There are murals enshrined outside the Buddhist temple depicting the crowning of King Vibeeshana. Today temples for King Vibeeshana are found throughout Lanka and he is still considered as one of the 4 guardian deities of Sri Lanka. A painting of King Vibeeshana adorns the walls of the new parliament. It is a fact that there is no temple for King Ravana where as many exist for King Vibeeshana. This goes on to prove that his stand towards dharma and justice made him a god in Sri Lanka.","October 18, 2019",0.0,0.0

It is believed to have been graced by Lord Buddha himself, on the eighth year after his enlightenment on a wesak Poya day together with 500 Arahats. The purpose of this visit was believed to have been according to the records of mahavamsa, was to reconcile an argument between two ‘Naga’ Kings, Chulodara and Mahodara over a gem studded throne at Nagadeepa. This was also believed to have been Lord Buddha’s third visit on the invitation made by King Maniakkikha. As the tale goes on, King Maniakkikha build a stupa enshrining the gem-studded throne on which Lord Buddha preached, and also included a handful of hair gifted by Lord Buddha himself. Kelaniya temple is believed to have been built prior to the 5th century B.C. and is not clear as to who exactly built the original stupa except the folklore of King Maniakkika. Prince Uttiya, who was believed to be the brother of King Devanampiyatissa, made renovations to the viharaya. However with the Dravidian invaders from South India, destroyed the original constructions, but was reconstructed. Portuguese in 1510 destroyed the medieval temple, where beautiful sculpture and murals dating back to the anuradhpura era was lost forever. The temple was however rebuilt again during the Dutch empire under the patronage of King Kirthi Sri Rajasinghe. It was later renovated in the 20th century under the guidance of Helena Wijewardana, where the deteriorated paintings were restored to almost its original state by Solius Mendis. We started our journey by visiting the Kaleniya temple which is situated on the other side of the Kelani River. This is thought to have been the actual temple premises, which most have now forgotten. According to folklore and the inscriptions in the temple vicinity, the temple was built to commemorate Lord Buddha’s visit and it is believed to have been the place where he enjoyed the refreshing water of the Kelani River. The temple vicinity is not as big as the Kelaniya Raja Maha Viharaya but holds the essentials of a Buddhist temple. The ‘Egoda’ Kelaniya temple is situated very close to the Kaleni River unlike the Kelaniya Raja Maha Viharaya. We walked towards the banks of the river in search of the ‘Thotiya’ and his ‘Paruwa’ to get across as you would have long years ago. For a mere amount of Rs 10/= (both ways), he took us over to the other side, where we were walked to the bigger and prestigious temple. If you are a resident of Sri Lanka, despite your ethnicity, you would have visited the Kelaniya Rajamaha Viharaya at some point of your life. It is always filled with the hustle and bustle of devotees, therefore avoid visiting the temple on a poya days and other special Buddhist holidays. Even on other days, it would be ideal to visit the temple early in the morning in order to avoid the crowd so that you would get the chance to simply embrace the temple itself and get lost in its beautiful murals. The dagoba of the Kelaniya Rajamaha Viharaya is unlike others as it is shaped in the manner of a rice grain heap, which is called ‘Dhanyakara’. The stupa itself has several names to itself ‘Kalyani Chaithyaya’ and ‘Kelani Seya’. The ‘Aluth Vihara Ge’ stands on a stone plinth, with a roof built in the Kandyan architectural style including a design of an octagon.  It consists of four image houses. ‘Oth Pilimage’ is the oldest section, consisting of a large reclining Buddha statue and two seated Buddha statues. ‘Raja Pilimage’ consists of older murals from the Kandyan era. ‘Ran Pilimage’ consists of murals which are modern (18th-20th century), depicting important occasions of Buddhism in Sri Lanka. Personally, for me the best mural paintings lie here in the Ran Pilimage, where it is unlike any other I have seen. A painting can depict a thousand words, thus telling us stories of Prince Danta and Princess Hemamala’s journey with the sacred tooth relic to King Vijaya’s arrival. The temple is believed to have links to the Hindu epic, the ‘Ramayana’. The sculptures surrounding the ‘Aluth Vihara Ge’ clearly King Vibeeshana’s coronation and other Hindu gods and goddesses. The Kelaniya temple also hosts the Duruthu Perehera, held in annually in January. Amidst the chanting of devotees, we made our way back to the edge of the Kelani River to our journey back to the other side on the ‘Paruwa’. There we saw a ritual we normally would not have seen in any other temple. Two older well-dressed ladies asked the ‘Thotiya’ to take them to the middle of the river. Which one was negotiating the terms the other prepared an offering with small stupa and flowers. Both got on to the ‘Paruwa’ and when they reached the middle, set a float their offering while chanting ‘gatha’. Something which you don’t get to see every day. Despite being destroyed several times, the Kelani temple is a special place of worship for Buddhist devotees and also a place of great historic and cultural value to us Sri Lankans. Make sure to pay a visit if you ever get a chance to both Egoda and Megoda Kelaniya.","July 19, 2017",0.0,0.0

It  is only few kilometers off from Colombo metropolitan, easily accessible by using Colombo - Kandy main road. This serene plot of environment is situated by the beautiful Kelani River, one of Sri Lanka's the four great rivers. The history of Kelaniya extends to the era of the great king Ravana. His brother Vibhishana ruled Kelaniya as a provincical kingdom. Nowadays, Vibhishsna is worshiped in Kelaniya as the deity of the area. According to the chronicles of Sri Lanka it is said that Kelaniya was governed by Naga(cobra) tribe. At the time of Lord Buddha's arrival to Kelaniya, Naga King Maniakkitha was the ruler of Kelaniya. Lord Budda made his visit to Kelaniya as an invitation made by King Maniakkitha. Lord Buddha, accompanied 500 bikkus and pearched damma to royal gathering, for that he used a precious gem studded throne seat. Later, kelaniya stupa was built  enshrining the throne probably around 5th century BC, then which become the symbol of Kelaniya. According to great chronicle of Lanka -the Mahavamsa this stupa had been renovated by king Uttiya in 3rd century BC and later by king Yatalathissa. The golden era of Kelaniya Monastery was considered as kingdom of Kotte, during that period its infrastructure was greatly extended under the guidance of the great king Parakramabahu VI. With the time Portuguese destroyed the temple to ground. During Dutch reign condition become better and Kandyan King Kirthi Sri Rajasingha renovated the temple and existing up to now. There are four entrances to upper sacred terrace which contains the stupa, image shrine, Bodhi tree, bell tower and few other buildings. The stupa is architecturally important and its dome has the shape of rice grain head hence called as Dhanyakara stupa. This stupa in its pure white coloration make the environment calm and peaceful. The image house contains 4 sections including both old and new additions. These 4 sections are Raja pilima ge- king's image house, oth pilima ge - recline Buddha image house, aluth vihara ge- new temple house and ran pilima ge- golden Buddha image house. Oth pilima ge was the oldest part of the entire temple. This image shrine is well known due to its unique paintings. Raja pilima ge and oth pilinage contain painting belongs to Kandyan era. Other sections contains paintings done by Solius Mendis. All the facilities including food, parking available close by. One can enjoy breeze from Kelani river by a boat ride.","July 17, 2017",0.0,0.0

An 18-foot stone statue of the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara has been erected at the temple. Buddhists believe that the Lord Buddha visited to Sri Lanka, eight years after gaining enlightenment during his third and final visit before 500 BC.There was a gem-studded throne on the original Stupa at Kelaniya Temple where the Lord Buddha sat and preached.

Kelani temple is one of 3 sacred places where the Lord Buddha has arrived in Sri Lanka other being Mahiyanna and Badulla, Muthiyanngana Temple. Much of its land was confiscated during the Portuguese empire although the temple flourished during the Kotte era. However, there were new gifts of land under the Dutch empire and under the patronage of King Kirthi Sri Rajasingha and the temple was rebuilt then. In 1510 AD , the temple was destroyed by the Portuguese, who had then conquered the Maritime provinces of the country. The original Temple and the Stupa or the Dageba, was built in 5th Century BC, but none of the earlier structure survive today. It also states that the temple was rebuilt by King Vijayabahu III, (1232-1236) and King Parakrama Bahu II (1236-1270).

Located about 9 Kas from central Colombo, I ended up going there taking Uber for about 750 ruppi, not a bad price. It was first day of the year and so temple was full of prayers who usually frequent religious places on this special day. It covers a big land space with many building, the most prominent of which is a temple with beautiful wall paintings and a reclining Buddha, a smaller version from the one in Bangkok. Other buildings include some featuring relics such as Buddha hair preserved in a golden jar behind glass, and lots of meditation spots. They even had a building where kids were performing dances etc. place was very crowded because it was first day of year but I can imagine how it can be peaceful on other days. Other main features was a huge tree which worshippers were queueing around to water. Meant to originate from a branch of a tree that Buddha grew in India, and also a big white dome with many Buddha statues around. Like all Buddhist temples shoes have to be taken off on site; however sand was quite rough and so were the rocks and so my advice is sacrifice an old pair of socks and put them on to walk around with. People are very friendly inside and will not treat you with coldness or aggression because you are a foreigner. I could fee a general ambiance of safety there, and didn't feel there were people attempting to pick pocket or invoke trouble despite the big numbers around. One restaurant about 2 kms away from temple called Seth, is run by a family and supposed to serve delicious local food. Sadly it closes at 3 pm and was closed by the time I got there.

Buddhism originated in India, from where it spread through much of Asia, whereafter it declined in India during the middle ages. Two major extant branches of Buddhism are generally recognized by scholars: Theravada (Pali: ""The School of the Elders"") and Mahayana (Sanskrit: ""The Great Vehicle""). Buddhist schools vary on the exact nature of the path to liberation, the importance and canonicity of various teachings and scriptures, and especially their respective practices.[4][5] Practices of Buddhism include Refuge, Samatha, Vipassanā, the Mahayana practice of Bodhicitta and the Vajrayana practices of Generation stage and Completion stage. In Theravada the ultimate goal is the attainment of the sublime state of nirvana, achieved by practicing the Noble Eightfold Path (also known as the Middle Way), thus escaping what is seen as a cycle of suffering and rebirth.[6] Theravada has a widespread following in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia. Mahayana, which includes the traditions of Pure Land, Zen, Nichiren Buddhism, Shingon and Tiantai (Tendai), is found throughout East Asia. Rather than Nirvana, Mahayana instead aspires to Buddhahood via the bodhisattva path,[8] a state wherein one remains in the cycle of rebirth to help other beings reach awakening. Vajrayana, a body of teachings attributed to Indian siddhas, may be viewed as a third branch or merely a part of Mahayana. Tibetan Buddhism, which preserves the Vajrayana teachings of eighth century India,[9] is practiced in regions surrounding the Himalayas, Mongolia[10] and Kalmykia.[11] Tibetan Buddhism aspires to Buddhahood or rainbow body.[12] Buddhists number between an estimated 488 million[web 1] and 535 million,[13] making it one of the world's major religions","July 11, 2016",0.0,0.0

This is one of the most ancient temples in Sri Lanka and the temples history runs as long as Before Christ era. So you can understand how ancient it is. As the legend says, Lord Buddha was once came to Kelaniya to stop the war between two Kings who rule Ceylon at that time. Thire war was about a Throne which was built using gems. Lord Budhdha made the peace between two kings by delivering his teachings. And finally the two Kings built a large Stupa by bestow that Gem Throne. A nice and great place to visit and experience the Buddhist culture. Temple has 4 main areas to visit. The fitst one is Famous Kelani Stupa. It is the largest stupa in Western Province of Sri Lanka. Next place to visit is Kelani Bodhiya which is also situated next to Stupa. And then the Vihara Geya. You can see some magnificient statues of ""wamana"" around the Vihara Geya. Also one of the best paintings of Sri Lanka painted by famous painter Solias Mendis in side the Vihara Geya. Those paintings are about the life of Lord Budhdha and the Buddhist culture of Sri Lanka. I strongly advice you to visit the Vihara Geya. Next place to visit is the Museum in side the temple, but sometimes it is closed. You can find the opening hours in front of the mesuem. You can find the Kelani river in one end of the temple. It gives a nice view in the mornings. Temple is open from 4am to 11pm (Actually I was there at both of those times and still it was opened). There are no dress code to the temple but I think that you know what Sri Lankan culture is. Best practice is cover 75% of your body before you enter to the temple. You can buy some fresh flowers and other things which need to worship from the small buttiques near the temple. Even some food outlets are there. If you are a tourist do not visit there on POYA days (Buddhist holiday). On POYA  days the temple is absolutely crowded.

There are few other statues on the outside wall of the shrine. You can also see the moon stone and guard stone near the entrance to the Shrine.
