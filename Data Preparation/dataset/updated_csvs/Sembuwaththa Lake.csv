He kept on praising how good the place was. The drive from Kandy was long and the dirt road not comfortable. The last couple of miles we had to get on tuk tuks for which we had to pay. All I can say the ride was adventurous and the drivers kept stopping and picking plants and grass and telling us what they were - black pepper, lemon grass and lots of herbs and spices. Entrance as always was higher for foreigners. There was clean toilet which was welcome. The tuk tuk driver dropped us at the lake.  We walked round which took about 30  minutes but we did  not go all round.  Lots of opportunity to take nice photos with tea plants all along the path. I believe there is tea plantation here as you can see the plantations all round. There was a group of school kids on a day trip. There was an option of a zip line though did not see anyone using it. Boats could be hired on the lake. Overall,  not sure it was worth the detour.","October 16, 2025",0.0,0.0

Initially road condition to get there was terrible?, if you travelling with a smaller car you won’t get there. Once we get to the tea factory had to leave our car and walk another 700m to get to the top. Otherwise need to hire a tuk tuk which would cost more. Ticket price was too high compared to other places in Sri Lanka yet no proper facilities were established and this place just a tea plantation with a lake in the top of hill, IMO. Once you get to the lake you have to pay more for subsequent activities like Kayak rides or boat rides, not sure why buying a ticket at the counter. You could visit many other places in Sri Lanka which easily accessible with and better facilities and more unique natural beauty.","October 13, 2025",0.0,0.0

This is not about the destination but about the ride from the main road to the lake. There are tuk drivers on the main road and they stopped us and convinced us and our driver saying that the road is so damaged that our vehicle (KDH high roof) can not go. They forced us to hire their tuks to go the lake which they asked 2,500 LKR per one for a distance of 5km. This is so unfair. Our drivers also was frightened after listening to them and we had to accept that tuk drivers and go with them. Also there were some good conditioned vehicles who had parked the vehicles on the main road and took tuks to go up. But I recommend future travellers to not to hire the tuks there because the road was reasonably okay to travel by your bike, car, van at least 4km. If you cant go beyond that you can easily park your vehicle and walk rather than giving 2,500 LKR for those robbers. We met many vehicles while we are travelling by the tuk including toyota vitz, Noah van, nissan FB 15, nissan caravan. Please share this news with the future travellers.

The location reminds you fo European mountain towns and on clear sunny days offers a breathtaking views. Google maps directions are accurate. We took the Wattegama - Elkaduwa road which is  narrow and slightly bumpy buy manageable. The turn off from this road to Sembuwatte Lake is not in good condition. We did see vans at the location but if you do care for your vehicle, we would recommend taking a tuk ;) It cost us LKR 2500 for the return journey. You can park your vehicle on the side of the road near the tuk park. We didn't encounter any harassment from tuk fellows (as mentioned in some reviews) but then again we said yes to first tuk fellow who asked 🤣 There is a ticket counter halfway through the route. Locals have to pay a nominal amount. There was a nice looking restaurant at the site, but they were selling only a few items like roti and plain tea. There were washrooms, but not sure what the conditon was as we didn't use them. The place also had a couple of summer huts where people could have a picnic. The day we went there was a heavy mist and we could barely see the lake..... but still loved the experience. You cannot bath or swim in the lake, but you can take a paddle boat. We also read in reviews that there are other activities like archery and zip lining. Either those items were suspended due to the mist or we simply couldn't see them due to poor visibility. There were couple of leeches, again it may have be due the wet weather on the day we visited. Considering the very bumpy ride upto the lake and the semi bumpy ride from Wattegama, the place is best enjoyed if you spend some considerable time there.....","July 31, 2024",0.0,0.0

This is empty talk. It was just a person who spread this rumor and declared the paradise of the world and it was circulated by the Ceylonese. The place is beautiful but ultimately artificial When you go to the place, they will tell you that the delivery price is 7,000 rupees per person (approximately 90 Saudi riyals), knowing that a tuk ride for a third of an hour does not cost 2,000 rupees. The way up is very rugged and takes approximately 45 minutes and the same time to get down. In addition to the 1500 rupees you will pay to enter This means that you will pay 8,500 rupees (100 riyals) and you have not entered yet, and this is a large amount on an artificial lake, and they all agree with each other to take advantage of tourists, especially the Gulf ones (note, they charge you a commission when you come from the driver). Secondly, riding in the sea is written 1000 rupees on the sign from the government, and they tell you that it is 5000 rupees, and more than once we have exposed their exploitation, lies and fraud, and if you expose them they mock you in front of the locals, and if you ask the locals they silence them in any way.

Three wheeled taxis (tuk-tuks) are available at the base of the road and charge around Rs. 1,200 for a round trip (with waiting for about an hour).

We had a 4-wheel buss, but we stopped before we reached the place by 25 mins and got there by a tuktuk (you must bargain the prices well, we payed 2,000LKR).

Entrance fee: 200 LKR I really enjoyed trekking along the tea plantations and through the pine trees. its well maintained and clean. If you are planning to make a visit please do not litter the area. Must say about conditions of the roads, it is very tricky. best way to get here is by a van which has a good road clearance. you will have to leave the vehicle near the plantation factory and trek the path to the Lake or you could take the vehicle towards the lake side as well. they've a special area for a vehicle park. you will find a small boutique to buy tea etc... My advice is to take your own food, be it a spend the day or a spend the night over. Make it day of picnic, you get some huts over looking the lake. Just relax and enjoy. Also accommodation is available on site. you need to call them up for early reservations, they've the Polo Bungalow which is 15000LKR for a group of 12. The Summer huts, kinda tree house 1000LKR per person in a group of 10 (less than 10 - 7500LKR) I would like to stay up here at a summer hut and have BBQ night the next time I visit :) This place has restrooms, but do take your sanitizes...
