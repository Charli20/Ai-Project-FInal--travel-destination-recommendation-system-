Our guide, Sithum, took us there perfectly timed for the sunset, and it was truly magical. Watching the sun set over the ocean, with the historic fort as the backdrop, was an unforgettable experience. Sithum made the visit even more special by sharing fascinating stories about the fort’s history, its architecture, and the surrounding area. He ensured that we had plenty of time to take in the views, capture photos, and soak in the atmosphere without feeling rushed.not too crowded. The combination of stunning scenery, historical significance, and Sithum’s knowledgeable guidance made this part of the tour absolutely memorable. I highly recommend this experience to anyone visiting Sri Lanka it’s the perfect way to end a day filled with exploration and adventure.","October 9, 2025",0.0,0.0

As your guide, I’m excited to share the fascinating history and beauty of this picturesque lighthouse, which has been a beacon for sailors navigating the southern coast of Sri Lanka for over a century. Standing at 26.5 meters tall, the Galle Lighthouse was originally built by the British in 1848, making it Sri Lanka’s oldest lighthouse. Though the original structure was destroyed by fire, it was rebuilt in 1939 and continues to operate today, guiding ships safely to the Galle harbor. Its white cylindrical tower stands in striking contrast to the azure waters of the Indian Ocean, creating a postcard-perfect view. What makes this lighthouse particularly special is its location within the Galle Dutch Fort, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Walking around the lighthouse, you’re surrounded by colonial-era architecture, cobblestone streets, and the ancient fort walls—all of which tell the story of Sri Lanka’s colonial past. The combination of maritime history and cultural heritage here is truly unique. The best time to visit is early morning or late afternoon when the golden light illuminates the lighthouse and the sea beyond. From here, you’ll enjoy sweeping views of the coastline, and if you’re lucky, you might even spot a few ships in the distance. Galle Lighthouse is not just a functional maritime structure but a symbol of the rich history and beauty that defines the Galle Fort. Whether you’re a history enthusiast, a photography lover, or just someone looking to enjoy the scenic views, this is a must-see attraction during your visit to Sri Lanka. I hope you enjoy this perfect blend of history, architecture, and natural beauty at the Galle Dutch Fort Lighthouse!","September 28, 2024",0.0,0.0

In fact, the history of this settlement goes back hundreds of years - it’s not for nothing that some researchers identify Halle with the Old Testament city of Tarshish, from which the well-known King Solomon actively “pumped out” sapphires, rubies, topazes, amethysts, etc. (it’s not for nothing that in ancient times Ceylon was called Ratna-Dwipa, which means “Island of Precious Stones”) and the tusks of the unfortunate elephants... Perhaps these are all legends, but on Ptolemy’s world map, dating back to 125-150 AD, this city is already present.!!! There are more than enough attractions here - Galle is considered one of the main centers of tourism in Sri Lanka, and the local fort has been recognized as a world heritage and included in the list of cultural heritage sites of the UNESCO World Heritage Site. My current post is a continuation of the “lighthouse line” of seaside lights of the island. Yes, yes, in Galle I found another lighthouse - Galle Fort Lighthouse. And this building, as follows from its very name, is not just a lighthouse, but an element of a fortification - the ancient Galle Fort, built by the Portuguese back in 1588!!! If you admire the Galle Fort from a bird's eye view, then, like the author of these lines, “take your hat off” to the fortification geniuses who designed this defensive facility. It was on the southeastern cape, on which the fort was built, that in 1848 the then owners of Galle, the British (the latter chopped off the fort from the Dutch, and those from the Portuguese) built the first lighthouse. You can see his photographic image in the photo album of Frederick Fiebig, a photographer best known for his photographs of India, Sri Lanka, Mauritius, South Africa, taken in the 50s of the 19th century, kept as part of the collection of the Oriental and Indian Department of the British Library. I took the time to find an image of the forerunner of the Galle Fort Lighthouse from the British Library collection: it was a 24.4 meter high metal structure, built from material brought from England, designed by the British architect Alexander Gordon. The lighthouse, as a direct sea light, and also as an element of the defense of the Galle fort, was built in the southwestern corner of the fortification, on the western side of the Galle harbor, just on the fort’s fortress wall, as if at the “base” of the Utrecht Bastion. From its top, the approaches to Galle harbor were clearly visible, and the lantern was visible at a distance of 19 kilometers. Unfortunately, this building was destroyed in a fire in July 1936 (I can’t imagine how a metal thing could burn out!!!). What we see now and what I managed to capture was built in 1939, about a hundred meters from the site of the predecessor. The height of the current stone structure is 26.5 meters. Taking into account the age of its predecessor, the Galle Fort lighthouse is considered the oldest sea light in Sri Lanka (which is quite relative, in my humble opinion). From a distance, the white cone-shaped “body” of the lighthouse looked very attractive (despite the cloudy and stormy weather). Nearby is a shabby pillar, evoking thoughts about the frailty of all earthly things and the postulates of uncle Sigmund Freud. The “postulate” that was most “beaconed” was the washed underwear hung at the foot of the lighthouse (apparently from the lighthouse workers)... Don’t miss it!!!","March 18, 2024",0.0,0.0

It is a must stop location for such an iconic lighthouse and a lovely place to pause on your walk around the walls of Galle. The Galle lighthouse is ironically located between the sea and the Dutch Fort.   It doesn't take much effort to get there but it is totally worth it. Wear beach slippers or flats in case you want to walk all the way. It is a nice place to chill in a shadow and also can have a picnic and jump into the water if you wish for leisure. It is an ordinary lighthouse which is still functioning till today. But together with the surroundings, it makes a nice setting to take pictures in with a beautiful view of the sea beach. It is a nice looking lighthouse, but you can't get up or inside of it. The surrounding areas is very nice. We took a walk around Galle fort Rampart walls, and the light house was before our sight most of the time. It gives calmness and refreshing in mind. It is small but cute and you get some nice views of the ocean standing on the ramparts. Good for an evening pre-dinner stroll and watching the sunset. Which makes an amazing sight. Lots of local families were there too as it was a weekend when we went. To select the time morning from 9 to 11 am or 3 to 5 pm as it would be comfortable. At 1 pm it was too sunny. There are nice restaurants and souvenir shops around. I liked not only the place but also the surrounding. If you go to Galle then you must definitely visit the fort and the lighthouse.

Strategically located at the southern end of the headland, it is in full view of any ships entering Galle harbor. The nearly 27 meters (90 ft) lighthouse is also visible from most of the rampart (protecting Galle fort) that runs along the sea. The lighthouse has some historic significance as the oldest light station in Sri Lanka, dating back to 1848. It may be noted that the original lighthouse built by the British (destroyed by a fire in 1934) was located about 100 meters from the current site and was 3 meters shorter. Although not a worth a separate visit on its own right, it does come with the package while visiting the old town and the ramparts. It is at least a pleasant addition to the landscape with its white structure set amongst the surrounding palms.","May 31, 2015",0.0,0.0
