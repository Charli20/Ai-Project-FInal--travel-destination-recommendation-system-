In/at the small restaurants on the beach there is a very relaxed atmosphere. Nobody became intrusive, everything “lazy”, just beautiful, just like before. We stay at Anantara Peace Haven Tangalle, which also has a phenomenal beach next door in its hotel property, but slopes slightly steeper to the sea. Both are wonderful to look at and suitable for swimming and/or romping with the waves, depending on the state of the tide. Visually a great pleasure.","February 13, 2025",0.0,0.0

There isn’t a lifeguard but the bar owners are helpful and friendly. One bar doesn’t have a food menu - the food is that fresh as it’s whatever they catch!

It’s nice that they are there to serve cold beer (500 standard price) and provide a lounge chair and shaded place to sit. But the constant pushing for you to buy something, or fighting for your service is a turn off.

The beach is a kind of tucked away cove surrounded by coconut trees and with a few restaurants behind the sand. The beach is very small, but as it was low season there were very few tourists so it felt very secluded and tranquil. The swimming was much better than in Tangalle, as although there are some strong waves they are not quite as strong as on the main stretch of Tangalle and water is fairly shallow. That being said, we still weren’t able to properly swim, more just wade in and jump about a bit, as the water is too shallow for proper swimming and if you go too far out you go beyond the surf where it is probably a bit dangerous. Also be aware there is still a rip tide of sorts, so keep a close eye on children if you have them. The restaurants did not seem to have elecricity as all the food and drink was stores in coolers, also meaning the range of options were limited. However, you can get noodles, rice, various more Wearern dishes if you want. We got a spiced grilled fish with chips which was delicious. *How to get there* Most of the tourists there seemed to be staying in one of the Cabanas next to the beach, however we were coming in from Tangalle town. We took a bus from the terrapin pond which is close to the base hospital and girls school. Not sure which bus, we just stood on the side of the pond (photo attached) and asked for Goyambokka and eventually a bus driver let us on, cost 20 rupees each. Just beware the buses were very busy and because it is a short distance, about 4 to 5 minutes, a fair few buses would not let us on. We then asked the conductor to let us know when we were at Goyambokka and he told us when. We also walked once, just along the road and that took us about 45 mins, but it is not ideal. A tuk tuk on another occasion cost us 250 rupees which is likely an extortionate tourist price but there you go. I’d recommend this beach for a more secluded experience and if you are happy to just sunbathe and have the occasional dip in the water, as there is nothing else there.","October 5, 2018",0.0,0.0

Being very much into photography the appearance was very important and I was able to take some great photos on this beach as it was so pretty, so it gets the seal of approval from me for that reason alone.

Welcoming people, awe inspiring landscapes, clean and cosy lodgings. That was until last night. We hadn't realised the new year celebrations were going to last a week. So for the past few days we have had some issues with getting around (no buses) and with ordering food (limited options). No biggie. Last night we had planned to visit Break Point Restaurant but alas it was not operating. As we had had a fabulous lunch of grilled prawns and the best chips we've had in Sri Lanka by and large we decided to go back to the shack on the beach. The shack appears to be operating under the name Bamboo (that's what's written on the menus) and is the first one on Goyambokka beach if you're walking from rocky point beach. It's the last one if you're walking from Anantara, Palm Paradise or that direction. As my lunch there had been delicious (my friend's vegetable roti was sub par but we decided we'd stick to seafood) we went back for dinner. It hadn't opened yet and we saw one restaurant further down had opened so we decided to go there for an appetizer. We got grilled lobster with chips and a couple beers. Delicious. The guys there were adorable.  We should have stayed there. But we wanted to have a different vantage point and shift places for fun. As we walked to Bamboo, which had lit lanterns, we noticed there was no one there. So we started walking back, when we were hailed by a dude saying he was the owner of Bamboo and we could have dinner. I sensed something was amiss but we decided to sit down anyway. When he came to take out order it was clear he was drunk and had been partying all day. That's fine but then why come open your shack? Just stay out partying. Our order appeared too confusing for him so we settled for  ginger beers and a bottle of water. He asked repeatedly if he could sit down with us. Not being comfortable nor in the mood to be chatted up by a drunk stranger we politely but firmly refused. He would have none of it and sat down anyway, bringing with him a bottle of Arrack. He offered a drink of this and when I asked for the price he said it was ""no charge"". Obviously I wasn't going to accept free drinks so I offered 500 for a glass. Anyway the problem wasn't money. The problem was this dude's being upset by us refusing to chat with him. We decided to cut our stay short and go back to our hotel. The dude followed us on the beach and we found him quite menacing. In the end my friend gave him an extra 1000 rupees and he finally left us alone.","April 23, 2016",0.0,0.0

Unfortunately the only time I've had a disagreement in our whole stay in Sri Lanka was here. When we arrived we were offered a deck chair in the shade if we bought lunch at the mans restaurant, or if we didn't buy we would pay a fee. We agreed, taking deck chairs under a dodgy umbrella that was more frame than coconut leaf but within half an hour this was under cover of a tree so this was fine. We bought a few drinks and had a nice morning, but when we were ready for lunch the restaurant tables were full. And on closer inspection all the tables seemed to be sharing one plate, and no one looked happy to be there. So we decided to go elsewhere. The owner then demanded 1500 rupees as we weren't buying lunch, which we had not agreed to but appreciate our fault in not agreeing a fee at the beginning. After an unpleasant chat, pointing out that we had bought drinks and he had no free tables, I gave him 300 rupees, which he ripped up. We walked off, he ran after us but luckily we were staying at a place very nearby. TLDR: Lovely beach, agree a fee and check the food/menu before using deck chairs.

Calm swimmable waters with some waves that will sometime carry you back to the beach (fun). One of the more charming aspects of the beach is that it is not crowded and just barely developed. The beach is unspoilt and the few shacks that serve food do it well to humane prices (try the grilled fish for an unexpected amazing taste experience). A great place to catch some sun and play in the water.,"December 24, 2015",0.0,0.0

Yes, this is a gem for most travelers to sri lanka. I really enjoyed this place. But,,,,,,, 10 years before, it was pure sandy beach that you could genuinely say private, but now it is full of beach restaurants or cafes and private beach beds. I advice every traveler who enjoy this beach and want to preserve it for the future, please please don't use those beach sacks. Every year it becomes more and more beach restaurants. As long as you are visiting them, there will be more next year. So. one day or sooner, you will not more enjoy the privacy of the beach, but busy dirty, crowded beach. Do you want that, are you really interested in preserving this beach for  the future, please do not visit them, but ask for your guest house or hotel to prepare a packet of snack or juice for you. That will definitely help preserve this gem in future. Thank you.","February 10, 2015",0.0,0.0

We were with kids (1 and 5) and it was a lot if fun. Our advice: avoid the shack at the left when facing the sea: the ""Rock view"". we found them,a bit tricky: they ""didn't have change on 500 Rp"" which we found hard to believe, the fish was not fresh and the guys were not very nice, especially the bald guy... Other than that: great beach !","August 21, 2013",0.0,0.0

We were very happy that nothing else happened.

However, we witnessed how a girl passed out after eating at one of the places at the beach. They obviously thought she was alone, but her friend was just away for a couple of minutes.

An amazing beach with waves to jump. Can't swim there but can cool off with the breakers. Around 3 small beach bars. Just a few other tourists. All wonderfully relaxing.

Stayed locally in Goyambokka so the beach was 2 mins from our guesthouse. For the two days I spent here there was no more that 20 people on the beach.  There's a basic selection of sun loungers to use and a wooden shack that sells drinks and serves simple seafood dishes. The main draw is the beautiful beach and water so clear it has to been seen to be believed.,"May 3, 2013",0.0,0.0

It has great and safe swimming, and there are loungers etc to relax on. The sun tends to disappear around 4pm, so best to get out early in the day to make the most of the sunshine. A few hundred meters over some rocks is another beach area which is absolutely stunning, almost unused so great if you want some peace and quiet - there are no loungers but the calm and tranquility would make up for this. The beach has limited facilities, no toilets and 2-3 bar areas which serve drinks and a limited selection of food. One of the beach huts stays open during the evening for a bit of lively entertainment, although a word of caution we heard a fair number of rumours about European women having drinks spiked. We didn't visit or experience this directly, but heard a few conversations referencing this so ladies please be careful with what you order, don't accept free drinks and make sure you see it being made or order something that can be opened at your table. I'm sure it is all ok but better to be safe than sorry!!","April 13, 2013",0.0,0.0

But then again, selflessness prevailed. So, I would like to say at the outset, please dont commercialize or ruin this beach! The beach is 5 min from the main Matara Road. We took two separate roads - one which has small guest houses/ villas on either side, and the other (which is shorter) is quite desolate. Goyambokka and Pallikaduwa are twin bay beaches. We spent our time at Goyambokka. The beach is large and clean. The water is shallow, but the waves over 8ft tall (in April). The water lovely shades of green and blue. It is in fact one of the coves in Tangalle. There is a wooden hut on the beach which serves up a few dishes and drinks. Apart from that, there are plenty of deck chairs to laze about on. That is pretty much it. Just a LOVELY LOVELY small beach.","April 11, 2013",0.0,0.0
