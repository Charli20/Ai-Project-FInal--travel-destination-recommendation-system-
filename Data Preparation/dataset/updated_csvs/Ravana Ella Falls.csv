It is currently ranks as one of the widest falls in the country. The falls have been named after the legendary king Ravana, which is connected to the famous Indian epic, the Ramayana. According to legend, it is said that Ravana, who was the king of Sri Lanka at the time had kidnapped Queen Sita, and had hidden her in the caves behind this waterfall, now simply known as the Ravana Ella Cave. The Ravana Waterfall can be viewed from the roadside. People try and climb the rocks for a closer view which is not advisable. As told by my Tuk Tuk driver, there were some death cases of tourist who tried to climb up the waterfall. The water is very cooling and you can take a bath if you want, but no place to change clothing.

If on a scooter, beware of the parking dude trying to charge you 200 for a 20 rupees parking fee ticket (the price is printed on the receipt) and the pushy dude trying to sell you some piece of rock by forcing it into your hands. Now, you kinda get the scene... Come to think about it, the monkeys on the main road down to the fall are way more fun to stop and watch. The macqaces(?) will let you get really close. They are curious and well behaved but the ones with white beards and black faces are much more shy. But we found watching them even more interesting.
