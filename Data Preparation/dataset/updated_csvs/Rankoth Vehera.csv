It’s absolutely massive, and even after hundreds of years, it still feels impressive and powerful. Built around the 12th century during the reign of King Nissanka Malla, Rankoth Vehera is one of the largest stupas in Sri Lanka. It’s built entirely of brick, and when you stand at the base looking up, it feels almost endless. I loved walking around the stupa and seeing locals quietly leaving flowers and prayers. Even though it’s such a huge monument, it has a peaceful and calming atmosphere. It’s also a great spot for photos, especially with the stupa framed against the blue sky. If you’re visiting Polonnaruwa, definitely stop here. It’s perfect for anyone who loves history, architecture, or just finding quiet places during their travels. Tip: Go early or late for softer light and fewer crowds, and bring water if it’s sunny—it’s a big area to walk around!","July 10, 2025",0.0,0.0

With no shoes allowed on the religious sites, it can be uncomfortable to walk barefoot on the very hot sand and stones paths. It is best to wear socks. Rankoth Vieara  enormous this was. It's definitely worth a walk around as it's favourite Dagoba in Sri Lanka. The Rankoth Vehera is a humongous structure in the midst of the Polonnaruwa ruins.
