Just for context,  we're from Portugal and have already seen whales in our country. We were expecting a similar experience and maybe that is the problem ... This review is just to manage expectations and for you to know what to expect from this tour or any other whale whatching tour in Mirissa (private or in group). They don't know were the whales are, there is no tracking system. They talk to the fishermen and the boat will leave for the tour case the fishermen spotted whales or not. In our case, they didn't spot any whales so they took us to the place in the sea where they were normally spotted. They found one fin whale and the next 1h30/2h was spent following that whale around that came up to breath every 10 minutes.... and that's it. The whale stays up for like 3 seconds so if you are lucky and looking at the right spot at the right time then you could see a whale for 3 seconds. Every time the whale came up they said that the next time would be the Last and after we would move to another spot to look for more. They said that sentence at least five times... The group tours and the private boats are all in the same place and they just follow each other. So, yes we did spot one whale and two sea turtles. If that is good enough for you then you should definately come. The tour staff is very nice, they will give you a sandwich,  slice of cake and some fruit (for included breakfast and snacks). We left the harbour around 6h50 and arrived around 9h45.","February 2, 2025",0.0,0.0

We embarked on the tour at 6:30 am, full of anticipation for spotting majestic whales and playful dolphins. The boat ride itself was enjoyable, with knowledgeable guides providing insights into the marine ecosystem and pointing out various sea creatures along the way. Although we were fortunate enough to see several dolphins, the sighting of whales was not as clear as I had hoped. It's possible that they were a bit shy or not as active on the day of my visit. Despite this, the experience of being out on the open ocean and witnessing these creatures in their natural habitat was still captivating.

But in Mirissa it was like looking for a needle in a hay stack. For me it was a disappointment as I planned my Sri Lanka trip in February as I heard it was the best time to watch whales.

I can only compare it to my other 1 experience where in the Caribbean we did a sunset dolphin cruise and they were swimming alongside and leaping out of the water alongside the boat, which was awe inspiring. I guess my negative feedback is caused by the fact that the boat staff were whooping and trying to make out that we had had an amazing experience and had seen everything we could have wished for. I might feel more positive if they had been a bit more realistic about the experience we'd had. Finally, I was hoping to see some of the Blue Whale population which they bragged are so numerous, however we didn't even look for any.

After asking around the whole of Mirrisa I finally found someone crazy enough to take me out. I managed to hire a boat for about 20 people for myself for about £130. Right from the off the waves was strong looking like they was either gona snap the boat in half or come over the top of the boat. I did manage to see 1 killer whale, 1 back of a blue whale and loads of flying fish. It was the flying fish that stopped me from breaking into tears from fear of the waves coming into the boat, I was actually soaked from the water that was coming into the boat. The captain told me when I got off im so lucky. I was scared as it was but when the captain started scratching his head like we was lost an we couldnt see any land as we travelled out for about 2 hours I was getting worried. The captain then let a 16 year old lad take over so he could look for the way back. I actually thought I was going to die with getting lost an the horrible waves.

The breakfast offered is a basic omelette bun with coffee and biscuits. They also offer some fruit at the end of the tour. The boats generally head out in a bunch and then spread out in an area where there is a higher possibility of spotting the whales. They also rely on phone calls from local fishermen and other boats to zone the area. We were quite lucky to spot not one but several of these huge beasts. It was a sight. We also got to see Dolphins, Flying Fish, Turtles, Jelly Fish while on the tour.

We arrived early and purchased our tickets. This was a seamless experience. We were told that the government had recently taken over the whale watching excursions and all tickets, regardless of the boat, were $50 US. We purchased our tickets and sat on the boat for about 45 minutes before taking off.  About five minutes after taking off there was some excitement from the captain which turned out to be a blue whale. We were told we were very lucky because normally the captain would have to travel 15 to 20 km out to sea before seeing a whale.  This is all well and good if by ‘see’ you mean nothing more than a dorsal fin emerging every few minutes and disappearing just as quickly.  We followed the whale for a while and the captain did try to ensure people on both sides of the boat had a look, but don’t expect to see through the masses of people when you see something on the other side of the boat. What’s more, we were told that government policy mandates that once you ‘see’ a whale you must come back to shore. Our entire trip lasted no more than an hour.

Really was amazing to see these great creatures.  Apparently, the last 3 days people had not been so fortunate.  The sea was also meant to be calm when we went but these boats do tend to go very fast and there were a few people that needed sick bags. Breakfast was provided (although they dont seem to cater for vegetarians.  so if vegan or gluten free then forget it).  It was well organised and we felt very safe.  They would only allow one side to stand at any given time for safety and allowing others to see the whales.  Fantastic.","February 9, 2019",0.0,0.0

In my case that was the main reason why I have opted Mirissa as a destination for my vacation. Unfortunately the day trip I joined was very disappointing. I woke up at ungodly hours just to be on time at the pier. All in all the other participants and I have spent seven and a half hours on the ship basically for nothing. In this wide span of time we could spot three whales only and for a few seconds. What's more they were very far away from us. As much as I have a very good camera, the quality of the snaps I took was really poor due to the distance between me and the mammals. I have no priblems saying that joining this trip has been a waste of money. While strolling in Mirissa forget the beautiful pictures of the whales you can see here and there. These captures are on display only to encourage you to sign up for a day tour. If you really want to join a tour, since it is basically a waste of money for the above mentioned reasons, I would suggest choosing the cheapest you can find. Maybe you can enjoy it and see whales close to you but the possibilities this will happen are very slim. For the record this tour is also called whale and dolphin watching tour. Needless of me to say I couldn't even see one dolphin.","January 30, 2019",0.0,0.0

If you havent been to any such tour, do take it. The tour starts early morning and before you realise you are in the middle of a huge ocean with sun setting it.. its peaceful and serene.. the trip is well managed. You are served light snacks, fruits, coffee and cake.. ample enough to call it a treat on a ship!! For those who are frightened of sea sickness, one tab(also available onboard) is enough to take care of it! the journey is about 4-6 hours in all but an experience in itself. Why should you do it? and now the main highlights... we did manage to spot many whales and few dolphins from quite close! Though the entire view lasts for only seconds, but if you are okay to count the entire experience in totoality, its worth it! Why you should not do it? If watching whales and doplhins is the only focus for the cruise, then skip it! you will get a way better view of atleast dolphins in those sea parks!!","January 27, 2019",0.0,0.0

Because of the internet cut, we were not 100% aware that there was a rough sea advisory issued by the Meteorological Institute of Sri Lanka. The board at the office said ''a bit rough'' but the sea was crazy on that day. Seriously, it was a very unpleasant experience, when the water was coming in, the boat was almost lying on one side - terrifying. I asked the crew if this is safe anymore, and asked them to check with the captain. They looked scared as well but said nothing to the captain. So me and some other passengers went to the upper deck to speak with him and he totally ignored the fact that the sea was rough and dangerous. 'I've done that 10.000 times, I know it's safe''. So we were in this hell for another 2 hours until finally we turned back to the harbor. The whole trip took 6 hours. We saw (barely) two whales and couple of dolphins. Food was nice, crew was great.

Firstly it is a long trip - we were told to arrive at 6 am but did not leave until 7.30 am. It was enjoyable watching sleepy Mirissa come awake and the fishing boats getting ready to sail - but an hour and a half wait was too long. The boat was uncomfortable and crowded with noisy Chinese who constantly moved about the boat or were sea sick. If you suffer from sea sickness why go on such a boat? Secondly there lots of overcrowded boats chasing whales. So while we saw 3 blue whales and one humpback and dolphins the whales do not come to the surface often, do not stay long and only do a short breach. Thus I would stick with David Attenborough and leave the whales to migrate in peace in this beautiful ocean. It is a difficult thing to conclude as whale watching is a source of local income and the crew were marvelous I feel that the number of boats needs to be restricted and that the boats should offer to go out and cut the motors and wait and hope to see a whale.

So, you must be lucky that your boat is close to this surface. It can be taken as a fun that you are out for a  short tour with so many people for sea voyage. But as per our tour operator, there are about 80% chance of watching whale. So can enjoy if your pocket allows ans having spare time.","December 12, 2018",0.0,0.0

As with any wildlife, it is a gamble on what you see but we managed to catch a few blue whales and a couple of other types. Firstly, you may find you get sea sick but our operator offered tablets to take if required. For us, the sea was quite calm but I still felt a little queasy! Secondly, there will be many tourists boats together and they sit static with engines on idle waiting for the whales to surface, at which point they all power up the engines and charge towards the whales. They did not however seem to get too close. As the whales only surface for a minute before they dive again, you will find that the chase is often fruitless. Note: it is highly recommended that you use a reputable company as some of the ad-hoc boats seemed overcrowded and unsafe. We also got to see a huge pod of dolphins and a couple turtles on the surface. Recommended but choose the company wisely!","April 1, 2018",0.0,0.0

But then, we saw the first one, then another one, seasickness unnoticeably went away and we could relax and enjoy the unusual sea walk, seeing all of those amazing ocean habitats. All in all, we saw 6 big whales including one couple of em, plenty of lovely dolphins, jumping out of the water in groups, a huge sea turtle and a bunch of flying fishes. The staff was very friendly and in addition, they played a bit of local music for us, singing and playing a percussion drum, which was really cool. The organization of the trip itself was really good - we had sandwiches, fruits, biscuits, juice, coffee, mint candies from seasickness and water, everyone was wearing a life jacket. Not sure what to add, but all in all we are really grateful for the trip, have plenty of nice impressions, and definitely don't regret we went for it!

Besides friendly people and beautiful temples and culture, also a lot of national parks and animals. Who can resist the elephant, or in this case the whale? People talk in seasons, but in Mirissa there is a part of the sea where there are always whales. Whales were one of the few animals I hadn't seen, so I had to go. My girlfriend skipped, because she had done this before somewhere else and suffered the two main problems: (a) not seeing whales and (b) getting VERY sick. From that moment, I was a warned man. And I did what I had to do: ignore warnings. So one day later in the very early morning I was sitting on the board with the first people. Things were taken care of, so we got swimming suits, breakfast and ..... pills against seesickness. Could my girlfriend be right? I took the pill, was surprised by the amount of Chinese people and we left. Within a few minutes you realize the sea is wild and the boat is light and shaky. My stomach is reminding me of everything I did wrong in my life. But I've been through worse and would sit this one out, staring at the empty see. The first noise was not from whales, but from our oriental friends who seem to be puking in harmony, a lot and loud. Can't remember laughing harder than that moment. Until a new noise. Someone saw a whale. Not much, just the back, spitting water in the air, and going down, showing us a glimmer of a tail. And again, again and again. You don't see very much, but you see it. Whales, from up close, slowly, relaxed. From the most beautiful things, we only get a glimmer, because it's real, not staged. This is one of the most beautiful moments in my life and I am forever grateful that I got to see 7 maybe 8 whales, whom made me forget I felt sick for a while. Than it's over and you realize the way back is a long way. The sickness comes back. I asked for the bag, which I didn't need because I could fight the sickness. And I had to because I had something to prove, after laughing so much at oriental people who got carried down from the upper to the lower deck. Some looked more dead than alive, but the noises of sick and puking Chinese people made me realize they all survived. I hope they enjoyed it as much as I did, and I hope you will too.","December 22, 2017",0.0,0.0

First of all our boat only had 10 people and I did see other boats that were packed. I used Horizon tours on their smaller boat that cost 6000 rps. The bigger boats charge 6500rps. Onboard we were all given a life jacket and sea sickness pills which I gladly took even though I do not suffer from this illness. After reading the reviews, I felt it was better to be safe than sorry. The waters are definitely choppy. Very difficult to stand or move around on the boat once we leave shore. So my suggestion, get a good seat and stay out. We were served water, sandwiches, juice and fruits. Even though the sea was rough, no one on our boat got sick. And of all the boats out that day, 4-5, we were the first to spot a blue whale, literally next to our boat. Huge whale, Full length, big tail .....an unforgettable experience. I have to admit there is a bit of luck involved because there is no way to guess where the whales will surface, after their initial dive , we were told they would resurface on 10-15 minutes but they can resurface miles away . So it was just pure luck and the keen eyesight of the guys on the boat to spot them and chase after them. After our first upclose sighting, we saw a few more much further away and got a close up of some dolphins and turtles. Again it was just luck of being in the right place at the right time.  We came back early, in 4 hrs and left all the other boats at sea still searching as they were two far away and missed most of what we saw. Worth the risk.....the whales are massive and beautiful creatures. Plus if you enjoy a bit of adrenaline pumping  ride, you will enjoy the boat ride. I thought we were going to capsize a few times.

You need to be there to buy a ticket at 6am. The boat leaves at 7am and you will be back at 12pm (5h on the sea). We went in october, end of the rainy season, so the sea was not quiet at all. The boat was moving a lot (all boats are very similar about 70 seats on 2 decks). 90% of the passengers vomitted. It was a nightmare. And to see what? Almost nothing: back of whales with some water thrown outside. Few hours of sickness in the middle of people vomitting for that? I saw humpack whales in Cape Town Massachussets: it was amazing: the whale jumped outside the water, play with their tales near the boat. But in Mirissa nothing. May be no much luck or may be not the right season. Anyway in Province town the boat is much better and does not move much. Here we were thinking the boat is going to sink.

My wife didn't accompany me, as she thought the sea would be wild & she has sea sickness, also someone had informed that it takes atleast 4-5 hours in the sea to get near the whales & come back. So she opted Out & it was a big regret for her later.. The Sea is not that wild in March & even the Boats r huge to bear the waves. 45 mins after we left the shore at Sunrise we spotted a cluster of Dolphins, there were lots of them after 30 mins from there we sighted the Whales !! what a sight that was.. Mesmerizing !! it came with its head out & then gently moved its body & lastly it showed its Big Fin & went under the sea, this happened again, but unfortunately i could capture the video & not the photographs :( (U need really good camera's for this) & what a luck, another boat called us & another whale was sighted & this one was very near. i could see it few feets away from me.. & even this performed the same feet !! & we came back to the shore, again from the dolphin point. i was lucky to complete the trip in 2 & half hours !! i can still close my eyes & see what i had seen then !!

The boat continued to be filled to capacity downstairs, whilst a member of the crew handed out seasick pills and life jackets which we all had to wear. This was not good so I went to get off the boat, asked why and told them I was not happy being sardined in, secondly why could we not sit up top. No problems go up top. People continued to arrive on board, I finally thought it unsafe to go when two more buses arrived. We got off. The Sri Lankan navy was there and the coast guard, not sure why, and the man with a automatic rifle didn't make me feel any better.

The is usually a small (faster) boat with some sonar equipment that is constantly looking for the whales. The moment they spot a whale they change their raise a flag and all other 20-30 boats rush to the as spot. The hundreds for travellers on the boat start pushing each other to get to the front or the sides (whichever side the whale is spotted) and in the end you may be lucky to see a 2-3seconds of either the back or the tail of a whale from 100-200 meters of a distance!!!

We were given life jackets but no instruction on how to wear them properly. For example there is a strap to pull up between your legs which prevents the life jacket from rising up over your head should you end up in the water and can prevent a broken neck. We were then given a box containing a roll and a sandwich plus done water. Many people were on the upper deck and some of us on the lower deck. We set off at 07:00. About 07:30 the boat was really rocking and spray coming over the sides. It then started hammering down with rain and a storm started. It was at least a force 6 or 7. My husband has 20 years of marine experience and he realised how dangerous the situation was. The side flaps were pulled down and people from the upper deck started to come downstairs soaking wet. Sick bags were handed out and at least 75% of the people were vomiting. There were three children on board who were crying. Some of the adults were very frightened. A number of people asked the crew to turn back. We were reassured that this would happen but it never materialised. We asked for an announcement to be made about what was happening but this didn't happen either. At one point my husband advised me of what to do should the boat capsize. He was concerned that the flaps on either side were pulled down which meant our exit was blocked. As we were in the rear seats he told me that I should drop my bag and go quickly to the back of the boat where there were no flaps and we should have been able to escape from the boat. They wanted to let us see a whale. I assume it was because they didn't want to issue refunds!!! Once we had seen a whale the boat was turned around and we returned to harbour. By this time it was 10:30. When we returned we discovered that out of all of the boats, possibly 20, which went out at the same time as us, all but 2 returned quickly. No apology was given and certainly no refunds either. I would definitely NOT RECOMMEND using this company due their obvious lack of adherence to safety.","March 1, 2017",0.0,0.0

The average on the beach was, we found, around 2000LKR per person, Mr Ganesh undercut this by 500 and after finding one other quote from a chap in an actual high street shop for 2500, we settled with Ganesh. The only gripe I've got with him is the only one anybody ever does - he's a big ol' fibber basically but we did describe and agree - very clearly I thought - that we'd have seats upstairs on the two-deck boat and not down. He lied on 2 counts; that the price was the same throughtout - patently untrue once you factor in private charters and families paying through the nose for additional services, and that there was free movement between both floors once the boat was on the move. I noted on other boats the latter may have been true but this was very much a designated seat, on your deck, not a free for all, which seemed safer of course. I mention this only because you may require your 'game face' at early-o'clock once you realise that's all up for negotiation. I also want to emphasise that I have no prejudices at all and if i may validate: I'm a scotsman living in London so I'm not unfamiliar with being lead on - I absolutely didn't take any of this personally nor am I trying to paint a disagreeable portrait of a nation and i don't begrudge him a living at all, this is just the way of it sometimes. We saw Mr Ganesh at around 6:45, having been picked up by tuk tuk promptly at 6:30 as agreed and dropped at harbour. After signing into a register (Name and nationality) we boarded and headed upstairs to find ourselves being shouted at (in a friendly manner mind you) that we're not going there. I got fed up pretty quickly but in a perfectly decent fashion, jumped off the boat, got mr Ganesh (who'd been hiding whilst I was waving at him from the boat - 2nd alarm bell - and walked him down to the boat where he shouted something at one of the boat folk. This, it turned out, had not been 'These lovely people have been told they can sit upstairs; sit them upstairs' and resulted in us basically ignoring the shouting and walking upstairs to grab some seats. We were told seats had been reserved simultaneously with 'you can't reserve seats' which said to me unless you pay more or double you aren't guaranteed a top seat. Not guaranteed, but not denied either, and once everyone was seated we grabbed 2 remaining seats and settled in. Bear in mind we only got the seats we actually booked from sheer bloody-mindedness, which is not my preferred MO on holiday. Sorry for teh long explanation but I figure the details might be of use. ANYWAY! Over to George Dawes and the scores on the boards - another minor hustle as we'd seen for 4 days here the boards had several hundred dolphins listed, apparently large schools hang out in regular locations. We didnt see any, in fact all we saw were two copulating turtles, which was kind of amusing when the other boats started arriving for an ogle, and a blue whale. But over all of these minor quibbles and the lacklustre count the fact remains - I SAWS ME A BLUE WHALE! and that may well have been worth paying double, especially when the big beast slapped its tail down on the churning waves. I'd even, almost, at a pinch, recommend Ganesh, if you can be front it on the day (go on I know you can) with a big grin and not-taking-no-for-an-answer charms, then get involved and as a bit of insurance you could eeven record whomsover you got the tickets from speaking into camera (in english only) and saying 'Top Deck MOFOS guaranteeed' I only do upper deckers.","January 20, 2017",0.0,0.0

The itinerary meant leaving at 5.45am in order to get to Mirissa for 7am, which we were fine with, given the guarantee of seeing whales that the tour operators provide. We paid $70usd for the transfer and he boat tour, which seemed quite pricey by Sri Lankan standards, but we assumed that we would get a car there and back, leading to the high cost. We were collected by a Tuc Tuc, leading to a very cold 1hr trip to the harbour, and questions about the cost of the trip. The boat we were taken to was already absolutely jam packed by the time we arrived, meaning we had to settle for downstairs seats on the inside, limiting our view significantly. Fortunately we were able to head outside and stand at the front of the boat once we made it out of the harbour. Once we were at sea, it was clear that there wasn't much science or organisation involved. The spotting consisted of 10-20 boats turning down their engines and waiting for a plume of water within eyeshot. Then it was a high speed and incredibly dangerous race to the area where the plume had occurred. This was rarely productive, as the whales were obviously on the move constantly. We did see a few animals cresting the surface within 50-100m of the boat, but this seemed to be more luck than judgement. In one mad chase, we came within approximately 1m of colliding with another boat. We were at least 5-10 miles off the coast at the time, and this could have spelled disaster for both sets of passengers had the 'captain' not been able to apply his rear thrusters in time. We did have life jackets, but there were no life boats and around 150-200 passengers on each vessel. Given the number of whales that appeared to be present in the waters, based on the plumes we saw, this whole operation seems like a waste. With some expert consulting to improve the crews tracking skills and more organisation/regulation of the companies and boats, this could be a much more enjoyable and safe operation. Instead, it feels like a chaotic and underwhelming disappointment.","January 16, 2017",0.0,0.0

There was no pick up in the morning. Despite several calls, the vehicle never showed up. I took a 3-wheeler and reached the harbor. Mr. Ganidu Rochana promptly received the money and assured seats for both me and my wife. We entered the boat and the deck was full. Mr. Rochana vanished from the scene. The crew said that the seats are for ""white tourists"" and we both need to go to the upper deck and sit on the floor. It didn't matter that we paid is the same sum and we were assured seats!!! I called Mr. Rochana who conveyed that he is on his way to the harbor gate to receive some European guests and can't come to the boat!! I've asked the crew not to sail and call the cops. They acted as if they didn't understand!! We wanted to get out of the boat. By the time we reached the lower deck, the crew started sailing!! There was no point in asking them to turn back since the boat was already away from land. I had to yell at them to get two life jackets when we were heading towards deep sea. There was a Sri Lankan family with kids on the upper deck who didn't have life jackets while the boat was chopping across rough seas. The crew didn't have enough life jackets. By God's grace, weather was alright and that family reached back safely - not sure how authorities allow such risky business. We did see whales - but, it's not worth the risk or humiliation which we had to go through. There are plenty of other professional agencies in Mirissa and Galle. If you want peace and dignity, just avoid Mr. Ganidu Rochana and his firm. We had to leave the next day morning to Colombo and I couldn't file a complaint. I can't comment on the experience of tourists from the Western nations, but if you're from India, just stay away from this provider; your money and peace of mind will be ruined.

It was magical to see the large blue and sperm whales, but that is where the magic ends. It took 1.5 hours to get out there, with a 5.30am start (from galle). We had paid an extortionate amount of money (6500 LKR) each (4 people) when other companies were charging 3500-4000. We were told this boat was better, with less people and a 'breakfast'. The breakfast consisted of a sandwich...not really breakfast when you've been up since 5am and will return to land at 12pm. The worst thing was that the poor whales were hounded. Each time the whale was sighted, all 20 boats (with at least 50-100 on each boat) would slam their engines into gear and hurtle towards their prey. It must have distressed the animals greatly, with one moment being especially upsetting when all 20 boats created a circle around one animal, leaving it with no where to go until it took enough air to go dive. People sat, applauded and laughed with glee, with no understanding of what is happening. I am by no means a 'hippie' nor 'eco-warrior' - but these are supposed to be protected oceans, and the sri lankan coast guard was even present, which surprised me as they let this happen on a daily basis. $10000's is spent on whale watching, with little regard for the animals safety or wellbeing. I was lucky to have 40 minutes out on sea before heading back as that was enough. Some people I heard had been out there for 7 hours just to see a single fin.

We got to the harbour at 0645 but the boat was delayed leaving as it waited for another group. This meant we were always at the back of the fleet when searching for whales so it took a long time before we could get close enough to feel we had seen the blue whales. It was an uncomfortable feeling to see a pack of 30 boats of different sizes haring off in the same direction when one of the spotters sighted a whale. The whales didn't stay long on the surface once the pack got close to them - can't blame them for that! All in all I have mixed feelings about whether this is a good thing to do. We weren't given any talk about the whales and their conservation so it has no educational benefit but I heard that these tours have been useful to local people rebuilding after the tsunami. It was amazing to catch a glimpse of the largest animal on the planet but it would have been better if some education had been included too and if we could have been assured that the whales weren't disturbed by the boats.,"December 30, 2016",0.0,0.0

If you're considering going whale watching in Mirissa then please go and read the reviews of Raja and the Whales - these are THE ONLY whale operator you should consider.  They are slightly more expensive but it is worth every cent.  They are the only boat trip not to chase the whales or get too close.  Other operators had overcrowded boats and did not seem to understand anything about sustainability or respect for these creatures.  Raja kept well away from the other boats that would crowd around whales in a big convoy of boats - simply disgusting.  The Raja crew are, I believe, the first whale operators in Mirissa, they appeared to have all the knowledge and knowhow and respect for the whales.  Plus they served up a very good breakfast and fruit during the journey.  Afterwards they collected our email addresses and sent us the photos from the day (which was just as well as we'd elected not to bother bringing our camera phones).   Nobody on the Raja boat was disappointed.","December 29, 2016",0.0,0.0

Indeed we saw some but 90% of all passengers weren't able to stand up because they got seasick due to high waves.

The boat was scary in itself - I was very dubious about getting on it at all with my three small children. If I hadn't insisted on life jackets for them, they wouldn't have received these as the crew had a very relaxed (not in a reassuring way!) attitude. Once out at sea, I was totally scared - the boat was rocking about like a rollercoaster. The kids seemed to find it fun, but about an hour into the trip, 80% of our fellow passengers were vomitting into plastic bags. It was certainly far from enjoyable for those vomitting or those not! We didn't see any whales (a few dolphins, which was nice but certainly not worth the 3.5hrs on that awful boat!). There was nothing else going on during the trip to keep our minds off the vomitting passengers, lack of whales or scary conditions (eg perhaps if someone had been telling us about what wildlife generally exists in the area etc it would have improved the experience). My kids eventually fell asleep out of boredom and I guess from the rocking rythm of the boat. We have subsequently giggled about the experince but I certainly would not recommend it to others. I guess seeing the whales is partly luck on the day, but even if we had done, I am not sure it would have compensated the boat and vomitting....","August 1, 2016",0.0,0.0

Returning to the whales briefly. Whales used to swim near the coast of Sri Lanka, then the tourist boats got too close, and closer, and the whales got further. So now the boats have to go further out to find the whales. Not only this but the whales don't do the lovely high tail dive you see on nature programs.

Nonetheless, it is a very long day and it was tiring and hot for getting a few glimpses of the whale every now and then. I could NOT believe on the number of overcrowded boats out there, all chasing madly at the slight glimpse of the whale. I am positive this is distressing for the whale and as an animal lover, this is a total no-no for me. This happened several times and at one point I counted 12 boats all racing after the same spot. On boarding, some of the briefing included instructions to remain in our seats so that the boat would not tilt to the side with the most favorable view. This off course was ignored by all the Chinese on the boat with one fat woman running from one side to the other taking photos. That would make the boat tilt very dangerously to one side and I am hereby predicting that this is an accident waiting to happen. I know it is a matter of time. Also groups of very disrespectful people standing and blocking people's views made this a very unpleasant experience. It is not worth the money the uncomfortable heat the foregone sleep the obnoxious people the long journey for a glimpse of the whale especially given what I think it is unfair to the animal. The dolphins swimming along the boat makes for a phenomenal view but having seen them last year in the Galapagos (without having to chase them), I feel the setting here is not appropriate.

Most of them are leaving at 7 am. This trip takes around 4 hours. Mostly you can see blue whale and dolphins but according to experienced people there are killer whale once in while you can see.

There were around 25 boats all doing the same and as soon as there was a sighting there seemed to be a mad dash to get to them and then the jostling for best position started. It certainly couldn't be described as a personal experience and at times I felt like a pack animal hunting its prey. The people on the lower deck seemed unable to follow the most basic of instructions such as do not all rush over to one side of the boat which mad the whole thing tip at an alarming angle whilst also ensuring those on the opposite side on the upper deck couldn't see anything; idiots.  In addition many people showed no respect or consideration for others by standing up and thereby blocking the views for the rest of us. We were one of the lucky 3 boats out of the 25 (so we were told) that actually got to see some whales; 3 blue whales one of which was 35ish metres long. Personally I would not take my children on this as it did not feel safe and I would not repeat this experience.  For anyone wanting to desperately see whales in their natural environment then I would research the best places around the world to go ie highest probability of seeing, good safety, low visitor numbers etc and maybe even consider paying the extra for a private tour if you can afford this. Sorry to be so negative about this but this is not an experience I want to repeat","February 28, 2016",0.0,0.0

I was so excited to see them as I heard and saw on Internet but unfortunately we couldn't see the blue whales but we saw two killer whales far away. As per the boat caption he said if killer whales are enter we will not able to see blue whales or dolphins and we had to return back after we travel around 3 hrs one-way in to sea.

Of course, all wildlife encounters involve a degree of luck.  The operator was responsible and met with the codes of practice for whale watching e.g. not getting too close, not crowding the whales, not cutting in front of them.  That is more than can be said for some of the other boats around.  So I am glad I chose this company. The boat was in good condition and has two decks, a lower deck with seating, and a standing upper deck.  Good views and visibility all round.  Both decks have awnings providing shelter.  Be warned the sun is very strong and you may not be able to wear a hat (or notice you are burning) if its windy, so ensure you have plenty of suncream on.  I ended up catching the sun a bit even though I was wearing factor 50.  A breakfast box consisting of an omelette roll, muffin and small pastry was provided, along with a bottle of water.  There are also snacks brought round during the trip. Even on a calm day (we went out on a calm day) the sea can be quite rough and particularly at the front of the boat you may experience a lot of rocking about.  I'm an experienced whale watcher and rarely get seasick, but even I felt slightly queasy at one point.  I'm afraid a few passengers clearly did suffer, and they were very well looked after by the crew. The boat wasn't overfull and the crew were good at spotting whales, and clever at knowing where they'd resurface.  They helped us by pointing out where the whales were, with crew on both decks to do this.  There isn't a commentary or a marine biologist on board, as you get with some trips, but the staff were knowledgeable if asked questions. The trip can be quite long - generally it will last from 2-7 hours, depending on how quickly blue whales are found.  So that can mean a long time on the boat.  Small children may well not enjoy the experience, as it's a long time sitting around without much to do and not much to see, no matter how wonderful it is to see a whale for a small percentage of it.  I always suggest whale watching is best appreciated by children aged 8 and up, depending on the child of course. I would definitely recommend this trip to those who like wildlife.  You've got a good chance of seeing something, even if it's not a blue whale, if you go in season, and it's a reasonable company that provides a good experience.  Do take your seasickness remedy if you suffer though, and stay at the back of the boat which tends to be more stable.","February 24, 2016",0.0,0.0

We left the harbour at 7.15 am like and traveled about 2 hours straight. All the boats gather to same place.Usually I am not a vomiting person but this trip make me dizzy and uncomfortable due to boat's vibration. I think large boats like the Navy boat will be more stable than smaller boats.Few of passengers even vomited. May be situation would be better if we took the tablet boat staff gave. We got morning tea/coffee,some fruits, water bottle,drinks/milo and some buns. We saw few whales (one very near by) and some flying fish. We didn't see any dolphins.But I am not very satisfied with what I saw as I expected more. (I think luck matters !)  When there is a sign of a whale every boat tries to rush towards them making animal fierce. So I think these people should have some discipline rather than threatening whale habitat. Most of the people went with me were not happy about the journey.So if you are not a person who loves sea journeys or a person with sea sickness please avoid this.

It cost me Srilankan Rupees 4,000. You have to be at the peer by 7.00 am. My hotel dropped me there in a three wheeler taxi for free. The boat was a double decker one carrying over 50 persons. Most of the passangers were young Chinese. First we were asked to wear life jackets and given tablets for sea sickness. Thereafter a simple breakfast of sandwiches was served. The motor driven boat travelled about 30 kms into deep sea. It has sophisticated sonar devices linked to GPS to detect where the whales are. When a whale is identified under the sea, the ship will travel to that spot and switch off the engine and wait till the whale surfaces. Every 15 minutes the whale has to come to the surface to breathe in. When the whale surfaces, it will first exhale which creates a water geyser about 3 metres tall. Then the whale will breathe in and remain on the surface for about 10 seconds and go to the bottom of the sea. It is a remarkable experience. Altogether we saw 6 whales on this day. The shipping company gives a written guarantee that if we did not see a single whale, they will take us next day for free. The whale watching trips are available 7 days a week. Mirissa is located in the Southern Province of Srilanka not far from the town of Matara. This is a very exhilarating experience and I can recommend it to anyone visiting Srilanka anytime in the year. The cost is quite reasonable by Western standards. I consider the boats are quite safe. They are regularly inspected by the Srilankan Coast Guard Department.","September 29, 2015",0.0,0.0

When we arrived at the harbor my husband asked if it was safe as it was raining and the water was rough.  We were told no problem.  We paid the guide upon arrival and of course he didn't have change.  The change was a minimal amount and he promised to give it to us upon return.  This never happened.  90 percent of the guests became seasick within an hour of departure.  At 3 hrs into the trip no whales were spotted and guests were so sick they were laying on the floor of the boat.  At 4 hrs in guests were requesting to return to harbor.  Staff lied and told us we were returning and would be back in an hour.  At 6 hrs in it was like mutiny on the bounty and the captain was still searching for a whale.  The swells were so high I got drenched.  Small kids were so sick and guests requests to return.  We left harbor at 7am and did not get back until 330pm.

This company was chaotic at best but in reality could seriously have injured the people on board. In short, the boat was completely full with not a seat to spare, something that must have caught the disorganised staff by surprise as they rushed to get extra life jackets from a neighbouring vessel prior to our departure. The weather was quite bad today and the journey was very bumpy to say the least (not their fault) and over half of the people in the downstairs deck vomited (again, not their fault). After around 3 or 4 hours of sailing without seeing any whales (again, not their fault) they asked who would like to continue looking for whales for several more hours. As the majority of people (or at least their children / partners / friends) had been vomiting for hours at this point, most people wanted to go back to Mirissa, although some were keen to continue searching. As a 'solution' to the fact that some people wanted to stay out at sea, the team hailed down another boat that was heading back to shore and attempted to move those who didn't want to stay over to this boat. People were rushed to jump over to the other boat, without life jackets, whilst the two boats were unsecured and banging against each other in rough waters. We were 15 miles from shore, this was extremely dangerous and if someone had fallen and been caught between the two boats this could have proven fatal. We had to shout out to stop what was happening and the only vocalised concern of the staff was that we were not getting a refund. As the sea is not a zoo, we didn't expect to see whales during this trip, and were more concerned about the welfare of our fellow passengers, some of whom had been vomiting for hours and were weak and unwell. Afterwards we were thanked by very many people on board who had been terrified of being pressurised into jumping between boats but were too scared to speak out. Again, the staff reiterated that we were not getting a refund. The money was the furthest things from our mind at this point. We subsequently went back to shore and were more than pleased to reach dry land. In all my years of travelling I have never seen the safety of tourists so disregarded as I did today. Do not travel with this company.

Whales are found in the Indian Ocean and hence you need to head to the southern part of Sri Lanka. One of the most poplular spots for whale watching is Mirissa -  located on the western coast of Sri Lanka, this place is about 170-180 kms South of Colombo.  The Whale spotting trip (safari) is an early morning affair and the boats leave around 6.30. It is not possible to cover this from colombo and it is advisable that you plan your stay either in Mirissa, or at Galle ( 20kms from Mirissa) or Hikkaduwa (45kms from Mirissa) or Bentota (70kms from Mirissa) ...  all these places are in one line and south of colombo along the costal route.  We had made Hikkaduwa as our base and travelled to Mirissa which took us about 50 minutes as the roads are narrow and there are several small villages and towns alongside and hence there is a fair amount of traffic early in the morning. The best way to do this trip is to book with one of the tour operators in advance.  You may need to make a payment at the time of booking or some of them are even open to accepting payments just before the start of the trip.  We were a family of two adults and child and travelling from India - we opted for a company called ""Whale Watching Mirissa"" and the owner is Ganidu Rochana.  We went with Rochana basis the reviews from travellers who had engaged his services - the decider for us was the service standards maintained by him and the understanding of his staff on the subject. And we were not wrong.  It is also important to be sure of the fact that the operator is engaging big size boats - as the trip extends into the deep seas, a big boat is far more stable.  The rates could vary from operator to operator and could range from 9000 Sri Lanka Rupees to 17000 SLR  -  it is advisable to fix the rates at the time of doing the bookings. Most of the boats leave Mirissa around 6.30 am - there are some clearances required, but a good operator takes care of all these procedures.   The entire trip could be a 4-5 hour trip and is certainly not for people who have sea sickness.  For those who haven't ventured into the sea and hence are not sure if they have sea sickness or not, it is advisable to take precautions - the trip is a tough one and a long trip.  It is a advisable to take the medicines for sea sickness an hour before the start of the trip.  Also make sure to carry your glares and camera with zoom lens - the whales will be at a distance and a normal camara is of no use.   Most of the boats have a lower and an upper deck. The view from the upper deck is certainly better and offers better angles for photography. You could read more about the experience on the blog .. http://wowplaces.blogspot.in/2014/01/whale-watching-in-sri-lanka-experience.html?view=magazine A final word, during the trip, make sure you drink enough water - as the heat and the humidity could sap you.   Go ahead, and enjoy this spectacular experience.","August 31, 2014",0.0,0.0

We contacted Ganidu Rochana from Whale Watching Mirissa before we left home and he kept in touch with us via email & text right up until the day of our trip. He even arranged transport from our hotel, around 2 hours away from Mirissa, which was an air conditioned vehicle with a very friendly driver. Arriving at the harbour around 6:30am you see masses of local fishermen selling their catch. Ganidu was there to meet us and accept our payment. As we arrived the crew were making sure that the boat was clean, including the toilet. We headed straight up onto the observation deck and positioned ourselves at the front on one of the mats provided. There is a small roof, but take sun cream, it may not feel too hot but you are out at sea for around 5 hours. A tasty breakfast was served, although we decided not to eat until after we got back to dry land. The sea is pretty choppy so we took a couple of sea sickness tablets just to make sure that nothing could ruin our trip. We were only about 10-15 minutes out of the harbour when up popped a Right Whale. Continuing further out to sea there was almost constant communication between all the whale watching boats to give you the best chance of seeing something. After a few more Right whales, the odd Green Turtle and a Ray fish we finally got to see our first Blue Whale. The crew are fantastic at spotting the whales and quickly point out the ""spray"" when the whale breathes out and moments after this the top of the whale glides out of the water. They also have great respect for the whales keeping the distance as per the regulations, unfortunately not all the boats follow these rules and end up scaring the whale into the depths. We enjoyed our whale watching trip so much we went again and this time the Blue Whales treated us to a show of their tales, a truly awesome sight. We were very lucky to have seen so many whales on our two trips, six Blue Whales and 3 or 4 Right Whales oh and one Dolphin, just remember the Ocean is enormous so there is no guarantee you will see anything but going with Whale Watching Mirissa gives you the best chance you may ever get to see these massive, beautiful, graceful creatures.","February 1, 2014",0.0,0.0

The boat is very stable and you get a delicious breakfast pack and hot coffee or tea.  The crew really do take good care of you and safety is uppermost. We cannot rate them highly enough - for an all round marvellous experience, with blue and sperm whales, dolphins, seabirds and flying fish. The other great thing about Ganidu is that he will arrange a bespoke trip around Sri Lanka for you, from initial airport transfer, hotels, transport between places, safaris (we did Yala, Bundala and Sinharaja parks), visits to temples, etc. Just tell him what you want and he'll sort it, no problem, and it all works like clockwork. He is totally reliable and keeps in close contact with you when you are in the country, attending to any details. He has a fantastic team of drivers and guides: Lawrence met us at the airport, Ruwan took us from Mirissa to Yala, Sanjay was a wonderful driver/guide in Yala and Bundala, Ruwan then took us to Sinharaja and thence on to Negombo before our return flight from Colombo. All extremely professional and excellent value for money.  Sri Lanka is a most fabulous country and generally not commercialised.  The people are very friendly and welcoming. The wildlife is amazing - in addition to the whales, we had amazing sightings of leopards and other big mammals and the birding is superb as are the butterflies and it's a botanists paradise also.

Not recommended for children as this requires patience and optimism. Locating a whale is like searching a pin in a hay stack. Mevan and the boat captain were excellent spotters and we would hunt them in the open sea just by spotting a fountain spray of water. Seeing a whale is a very humbling experience; all that is required is a flick of its tail and the people in the boat would disappear into oblivion.

After about 2 hours the passengers decided it is time to come back as everyone was soaked and shivering. This was probably the worst $40 spent ever (per person). I understand that sea can be unpredictable, but I would expect the captain to at least check the weather forecast and warn about potential problems. I can only imagine how stressful it was for the couple sitting in front of us - they were with a 2-3 yo child and the woman was pregnant. After 3 hours in the rain she could not withstand the cold and had to be taken away from the watching deck. After we came back to the harbour there was not even an apology, not to mention any sort of refund for 4 hours in really bad weather conditions. To sum this up, I guess we were just really unlucky as there are tons of great reviews of this attraction on the net. What made me really disgusted was the complete lack of any warning from the crew caused by their drive for tourist money.","February 18, 2012",0.0,0.0

We started at 4.45 am and arrived at the fisheries harbor at around 6.20am.After checking several websites I spoke to one Ganidu  after going to the website www.whalewatchingmirissa.com.Though he was a simple village lad with a promising future and marketed well .The boat had an upper deck with a good clean toilet that could accommodate upto 30 guests. All were given life jackets as it is required by law and every boat was checked by a navy officer prior to sailing.  We sailed at 7.00 and after 45 minutes in the sea we were able to see some spinner Dolphins .Cheese sandwiches were given with bananas and a bottle of water on the way and Pineapple was served to our delight on the way back. THE ASISSTANTS WERE ALSO VERY FRIENDLY and assure us that somehow they will show the whales and Dolphins as the sea was calm that day.By 9.00 we had gone about 20 km .The guy who was on the front deck most of the time balancing himself with ease was very clever in detecting the whales coming to the surface gushing water at a distance. Then he instructs to steer the boat towards them as the whales stay up swimming for about a minute before going in and again surfacing after every 10 minutes or so. Some small boats were lucky at times as the whales’ surfaces close to them at times. The main advantage you have going in these boats is that they can manoeuvre fast .. We got our chance after the 5th attempt and the two whales surfaced not even 10 meters away to our right .As the boats generally slow down and the noise is very low the whales I thought just swam oblivious to the attention they got.   The experience was great and we returned to the harbor at 11.30. Asiri, Colombo, Sri Lanka","February 9, 2012",0.0,0.0

In reality you blast around the sea at top speed in such choppy waves that you are more or less guaranteed to feel the worst sea-sickness of your life, whilst a local perches on the end of the boat hoping to catch a glimpse of a whale. I thought they were some sort of experts who could maybe tell you about the whales and knew roughly where to pinpoint them, but actually the crew are the equivalent of boy racers of the ocean who nail it around at top speed hoping to find something, and there is no guarantee that you will. The rate for this godawful experience is beyond a rip-off when you look at what you have been spending on food and accommodation. I didn't think I suffered from sea-sickness, but by the end all but two of the passengers were gripping to the rails trying not to be sick (with mixed success). My girlfriend described it as the worst experience of her life and said she wanted to jump in the ocean to make the nausea stop. I wouldn't go quite as far as this but it is definitely not an experience I would recommend or repeat.","January 21, 2012",0.0,0.0

On the day we went out they could not find whales for a long time. The other boats that had been close alongside turned back about 30 minutes before us, having seen a few whales at a distance. We were finally rewarded by close views including the classic dive with the tail in the air. We also saw dolphins on the way back and, in spite of the fact we were going to arrive back about an hour later than expected they happily stopped for us to enjoy watching the dolphins' antics - including jumping up and swimming close to the boat. I got the strong impression that the crew really tried their hardest and went the extra distance to make saw we saw the whales properly.","January 18, 2012",0.0,0.0

The sea South of Mirissa has great wildlife and there is a very high chance of seeing Blue Whales and also large numbers of Spinner Dolphins.  We also saw a sea snake, although that is a rare sighting. There is some variation in the quality of boats that go out.  We went with the Mirissa Paradise Beach Hotel's outfit, which was very nice - decent quality modern trimaran with friendly crew (plenty of life jackets) and a half decent breakfast provided.  Price was SLR6,500 p.p.  Unlike the previous reviewer I found (at least this operator) to offer a service the equal of whale watch trips in the US or NZ.","January 8, 2012",0.0,0.0

However, if you want to see blue whales off the Southern Sri Lankan coast, you probably need to minimise your expectations of the ease and comfort of such a trip, particularly if you have already seen whales off the Pacific Coast of Canada/USA or in Hawaii. The options available are either the largest available vessel operated by the Sri Lanka Navy and what can only be described as a ferry.  It is probably the most comfortable trip of the available boats, but the viewing platform is crowded and the size of the vessel means it is very difficult to manoeuvre close to the beautiful ocean mammals.  Prices for a morning trip are quoted at up to US$100pp for foreigners.  As usual in Sri Lanka I suspect Sri Lankan nationals pay less. At the other end of the scale, you can arrange a trip often through a tuk tuk driver for US$50-65pp on a much smaller boat.  Be warned however that the swell once you are out of Mirissa is frequently 4-5 feet and the boat we were on travelled at c. 11kph.  We were required to wear life jackets, but there was absolutely no briefing, safety or otherwise, from the skipper.  It was more of a taxi service than a guided tour.  Of the 25 tourists on our boat 5+ people were sea sick which took the gloss off the trip somewhat. On a very positive note however, the boats we saw once we got close to the whales did not attempt to harass or get to within less than 20m to the whales, which was quite a pleasant change from our nature trips I have been on. I would still recommend the trip but just be warned that it isn't cheap, those who suffer motion sickness will get likely be sick and it is a minimum 4 hour trip.  But then again how often do you get to see Blue Whales?","January 6, 2012",0.0,0.0

The website is run from Colombo and I guess they contact the local boats to make arrangements as required.  This came as a bit of a surprise a to me! Our boat was small but we had it to ourselves and after over an hour's sailing out to sea, our vessel was actually the first one to sight a whale (quite a few boats set off at around the same time and split up) then every boat chases the whales for more sightings.  At times there were two whales in view at a time but because of the speed they move at and the distance they cover it was impossible to say how many whales we saw but it was an exciting hour spent whirling about and setting off in pursuit of the next spout of water or sight of a great black shape in the ocean.  The fare seemed good value at SLR50,000 especially as we were the only passengers on this occasion (they would have taken more if anyone else had turned up I'm sure) but I don't know how it compares with the ""official"" tour boat.  We didn't partake of the breakfast offered, it was quite a bumpy ride and my partner felt a bit seasick at times.  A true adventure can never be cosy!  We were however in safe hands with four crew members including an expert spotter. In future all we will remember will be the excitement of the 'chase' and the awe of seeing these magnificent creatures in their own environment.","December 30, 2011",0.0,0.0
