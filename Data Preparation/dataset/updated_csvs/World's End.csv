We enjoyed the track and the variety of flora and fauna along the way. The walking track has been well designed to capture this. However,  compared to the past the walking track has been extended and took us over 6 hours to complete which was only abour 4 hours in the past. The extension now includes the mini worlds end , the great worlds end and Bakers Fall. Visitors need to prepare for this which we did not do and therefore it was challenging. Cost for foreigners is unfair, cost about Rs 30K for 3 people and a vehicle. For locals it is free. Access road to the start of Worlds End from Nuwaraeliya is pretty scary, very windy, narrow, in poor condition and remote. This is over an hour of driving.","September 4, 2024",0.0,0.0

Located in the Horton Plains National Park, World’s End offers one of the most stunning panoramas in the country, and witnessing it firsthand never fails to impress. As a guide, I find that the journey to World’s End is as captivating as the destination itself. The trek through Horton Plains, with its rolling grasslands and diverse flora and fauna, sets the stage for the dramatic view that awaits at the end. The crisp, cool air and the lush landscape create an invigorating experience, making the hike to World’s End truly rewarding. The highlight of the visit is, of course, the sheer drop at World’s End. Standing on the precipice, visitors are treated to an awe-inspiring view of the valley below, with a seemingly endless expanse stretching out to the horizon. On clear days, the view is nothing short of spectacular, offering a glimpse of the far-off lowlands and a sense of being on the edge of the world. One of the most rewarding aspects of guiding at World’s End is sharing the rich natural history and significance of Horton Plains with visitors. The park is home to a range of endemic species and unique ecosystems, and explaining the ecological importance of the area adds depth to the experience. From the diverse birdlife to the rare flora, the park’s natural beauty is a key part of the adventure. The trek to World’s End is also a fantastic opportunity for visitors to appreciate the importance of conservation and the delicate balance of Sri Lanka’s highland ecosystems. Engaging with travelers about the park’s efforts to preserve its unique environment helps foster a greater appreciation for the natural world. For anyone seeking a memorable adventure in Sri Lanka, World’s End is a must-visit destination. Its dramatic scenery, combined with the rich natural and cultural context, makes it a standout experience. Join us on a trek to World’s End and witness the breathtaking beauty of Sri Lanka’s highlands like never before.","August 10, 2024",0.0,0.0

Make no mistake, the complete walk is quite a trek. World's End is about 4 kms from the car park and there are a numbver of rocks to walk over but it is not too bad. Take shoes with a good tread because there are a lot of very small loose round stones that are easy to slide on. I would say that it would be about a 3 out of 5 fitness trek. You can either go back the way you came or continue on to see Bakers Falls and then continue to the car park where you start. The round trip is about 9.5 kms. It will take the average person about 2.5 to 3 hours to complete but that also depends on your fitness level, how many stops you do to take photos, catch your breath or rest your legs. Is it worth the trek to see World's End? In my opinion it isn't however the sense of achievement is well worth it and I am very pleased that I did do it. There is only one World's End on the planet so you could look at it as a bucket list thing to do. The reason I said it wasn't is because it is a 900 meter drop from where you are at the sign to the bottom but you cannot see the distance. There is no viewing platform and this was why I was so dissapointed. The view of the hills and surrounding area is amazing so your trek is not wasted. As you will see from my photos, there is a slab of concrete on the ground saying World's End and then the next photo is just to the left of the sign. There are no barriers so you have to be very aware of that. Bakers Falls is beautiful. There had not been a lot of rain there lately so apparently there was not as much water flow as usual.","April 2, 2024",0.0,0.0

The view from world's end and little world's end is rather lovely, but I wouldn't call it spectacular. On the contrary, I'd argue that anyone who's done some hiking in the mountains anywhere would probably have experienced far more spectacular scenery than this. And the hike through the grasslands afterwards isn't exactly fantastic either. Yes, it's nice, serene and quiet, but the views are nothing special.

The track is more open and easier to walk and within 30 minutes we arrive at World's End, so named because of the 800 metre sheer drop to the valley below.

Not quite as easy as made out to us! We went by tuk tuk (quite good fun even if a little snug as there was 3 of us) and left Nuwara Eliya at 6am. It took about an hour to get there. If taking a tuk tuk wrap up warm.  We froze! It was extremely cloudy and raining when we left. Thought about not going but local tuk tuk driver insisted it woukd be ok on Horton Plains. Arrived and still covered in cloud but he still insisted it would clear. Cost 8000 rupees (£40) entrance for 2 adults and  1 child in a tuk tuk to enter the park. Pricing seem confusing and not sure if the charge different for different vehicles. Well the driver was right. After starting to walk the cloud lifted and we had amazing views. Got quite hot so glad I wore shorts even if I froze on the way.  By the time we got to World End we had an amazing view. We then continued to Bakers Falls. More difficult to walk as that part is a path is through the forest so climbing upwards and over tree routes was slippery. Took about 3 1/2 hours to walk but was worth it. Just make sure sensible footwear is worn and layers of light clothes. We would have baked in jeans! You can't take plastic bags or wrappers into the park. However you can take plastic water bottles in. You just have to remove all the plastic labels from them first which they do if you haven't already.,"August 25, 2017",0.0,0.0

It was quite an easy walk, did get slightly tired at certain bits. We forgot to bring trainers and socks so did the walk in flip flops...wasn't the best idea as in the morning it was freezing!!! Warmed up after the sun came up though. I would recommend wearing trainers or walking boots. When we got to Worlds End there was no one there which was lovely as we had the place to ourselves for around 15 mins. It did get very very busy all at once and there is no railings so you can go right up to the edge, quite scary but was a fantastic view! Deffinatley worth a visit.  The first part of the walk on the left route was quite rocky going downhill but nothing too extreme so can be done taking your time if your not too sure. People of all ages did the walk. There is a pool of water after or before Bakers Falls depending which way you start the walk, it's got a small waterfall going into it, we had a quick swim in it, was lovely but very very cold!!!! If you don't mind the cold go for it as was a beautiful setting. Hortons Plains was very out the way with not much around and was quite hard to get to...we drove ourselves in a tuk tuk so it would probably be easier in a nice warm van with a driver!

The ‘plains’ themselves form an undulating plateau over 2000m high, covered by wild grasslands and interspersed with patches of thick forest, rocky outcrops, filigree waterfalls and misty lakes. The surprising diversity of the landscape is matched by the wide variety of wildlife. The plateau comes to a sudden end at World’s End, a stunning escarpment that plunges 880m. Unless you get there early the view from World’s End is often obscured by mist, particularly during the rainy season from April to September. The early morning (between 6am and 10am) is the best time to visit, before the clouds roll in. That’s when you’ll spy toy-town tea plantation villages in the valley below, and an unencumbered view south towards the coast.

I made the trip in Jun 16 with wife and my sis in law. my experience & suggestions are as follows Worlds end point is one of the points in horton plains national park, for going to worlds end, you need to be prepared to walk for 8.7 kms & complete the horton plains hike... 1) stay and getting there Horton plains are grassy lands and about 1800 mts from sea level... For going there you need to stay the night at nuwara eliya and start at abt 5:30 am next morning for the plains which are abt 40 kms from nuwara eliya We stayed at a budget hotel called ashford and got a room for lkr 5500.. Check their website and call them directly for a booking to get a good deal (Hotel ashford +94522235771)... If not this there are other budget places in nuwara eliya which you can opt for... But staying back is a must for this trip. 2) Transport The plains are abt 40 kms from nuwara eliya and most of the road is very narrow and has steep upward slopes... You will get vans and jeepa who will take you there and bring you back. The cost is 3.5 to 5 k lkr... There is also an option of going by tuk tuk but i suggest to avoid it given the cold winds and tuk tuk also costing abt 3k lkr... Most hotel receptions will have a contact of a van so its easily available. You can also go there in your own car... But given the narrow and steep roads i suggest you take your car only if its a 4x4 or has a good ground clearance... The parking charges for car at the gate is 250lkr. giving your our guys contact who took us there in a jeep and charged us 3.5k lkr (herath +94779149563) 3) ticket fees I was myself very confused abt the ticket prices and didnt get firm info on this... So im clarifying the tickets cost for the benefit of all Ticket cost for foreign passport holders is approx 3800lkr and this is common for all countries The local ticket is just 60lkr and you can get this ticket if you have a residence visa in srilanka and are carrying your passport with you 4)The hike Once inside and at the start point you have 2 routes to do the hike that is from the left or the right of the starting stone.. The starting stone shows the distances of all major points from the start in both directions.. The total hike is 8.7 kms First of all.. Dont leave the hike midway and come back... You will end up walikng the same distance as completing the hike if you do that. My suggestion is to take the hike from the right like we did cause it slopes down few kms from the start point upto bakers fall where there is a serious slope down. If you do the hike from the left you will be climbing up these last few kms which will be very very tiring. Most tourist take the hike from the left as the worlds end point is near from there... But trust me the right side is best for saving up energy and doing a comfortable hike. 5) the points The 2 best points in the hike are the worlds end and bakers fall Bakers fall is a nice big and peaceful water fall that makes for a great photo stopover Worlds end is just a magnificent view where there is a sudden drop of 870mts and great view of the adjoining mountains and lake. The vertical drop can not be captured in a photograph hence all the pics we see of the place do not amaze us a lot.. Its is best advised to reach the worlds end point by 7-7.30 am so you must start the hike early at around 6 am from the entrance... If you reach the worlds end point late then it gets a cloud cover and nothing much is visible from the point. Along the hike you will see some sambar deers grazing along and if your lucky you can get a snap with some if they are close to you. The total hike took us a good 3 hours with stopovers and it was very very cold and windy in the morning when we started... So i strongly suggest you go there with a set of warm wear. While returning back to base... You must stop over at pattipola train station which is the highest altitude station in srilanka and also ambewella newzeland farm which again make for a good photo stop. All in all... The experience of walking the grass lands along with deer's, mist and beautiful views is just exhilarating and cant be described in words. I would rate my experience as a 9/10 and just taking away a point for the trouble involved in getting there and the money required to be spent and the fact that by the time you get back to the hotel by 12:30 pm you immediately have to check out leaving you tired from the hike and deprived of sleep the previous night. But still its a must do if you are planing a nuwara eliya visit. All the best to all fellow travellers :)","July 24, 2016",0.0,0.0

Finish it off with a cup of tea and biscuits at the canteen overlooking the plains. On more practical information, the entrance to the plains is an hour’s drive from Nuwara Elliya (approximately) and the tickets are slightly expensive (but worth every penny). Take the route on the left (which reaches baker’s fall last) since it’s a better way to circle the plains. Also, if you get tired halfway and feel the urge to turn back – don’t, because even if you turn back you’ll have the same distance to cover and you’ll miss the trail on the other side.","June 11, 2016",0.0,0.0

You you must have been on both viewing points before 10 am, because on most days the clouds roll in between 9 and 10 am and this will obscure the view completely.

A winding  6 kilometer long trek across the plains  and through stretches of  montane forests brings one to the edge of the plains and first to the Smaller World's End and then a few hundred meters beyond on the same trail to the Greater World's End - the coveted destination. World's End is literally  a sheer drop of around 3,500 feet to a sparsely populated valley below. The view from the edge- where there is a viewing platform - on a clear day is magnificent and when the cloud cover rolls in engulfing the entire surroundings- as it often does, is  stunning. One can see a number of some of the highest mountains in Sri Lanka from here.The temperatures often plummet to around 10C and the rains are quite common. The trail that the travellers take is circuitous and on its way back will take travellers to another attraction on the plains -the Bakers Falls.","September 8, 2015",0.0,0.0

My driver company during this walk was instrumental to its success as the 3years old might have got tired at any point. the driver carried him several times for few hunder meters. such an excellent driver  for families with kids.","September 2, 2015",0.0,0.0

We had read earlier reviews about this point and it was among top most things to visit in Srilanka . We had paid around 7000 LKR for the entry. ( including one vehicle ) . The moment you enter , you would feel that you are amidst the clouds. It's a beautiful scene. Then from the car it takes you to a point, beyond which the walk starts. Food and drinks are not allowed inside . You would see a board to the worlds end - one can start from right as well from left . It's a walk in a circle form . At the end you would reach where you started from. The total walk is around 9-10 Kms. There is no option of eating in this path. We came across 2 washrooms though . We started from left and the path was filled with rocks. Wearing shoes is advisable but it is okay if you aren't wearing one. You will still make it as we did 😀 the journey is really beautiful , greenery everywhere . Small climbs , few jumps .. Few falls . After an hour you would reach mini worlds end. It was a nice spot. Then after around 20 min of further walk, you would reach the worlds end. Little hyped . Then after around an hour you can see bakers fall . It's a small waterfall . Even if you miss , it is okay . Then after around 1 hour you would reach back to the starting point . At these main points you just spend like few minutes , but the whole journey of 3-3.5 hours is filled with scenic beauty . It's worth a visit for sure.","August 20, 2015",0.0,0.0

You can drive up to Horton Plains irrespective of the route you take.  Nuwera Eliya route is more winding, but spectacular view!  Vehicles are parked after the ticket office in Horton Plains.  There after the walk starts. There are 2 routes that can be taken.  It’s recommended that you take the Baker’s Falls route to reach world’s end and then take the other route to get back to the Plains.  The total walk is 9 km.  We took 3 hours to do the whole walk, stopping at world’s end, mini-world’s end and baker’s falls.  If you are someone who would need a rest in-between, it may take upto 4 hours. Baker’s falls route is longer and tougher.  But the water fall is so breath-taking, it’s worth toughing it out!  There are places where the road to walk is just a foot path through rock formations.  There are slippery slopes and muddy patches…. But its nature at its best!! Word of advice…. When you come to the place where you need to decide which route to take, you would see a name board which is very confusing and has arrows pointing both ways.  So remember, when you stand in this ‘Y’ junction and wonder which way is the baker’s fall route, it’s on to your right!! All those people who have no respect for nature and litter this amazing, natural piece of heaven by throwing water bottles and biscuit wrappers…. Remember that you are destroying one of Sri Lanka’s most beautiful places…. This is where the world end’s and nature begins to show us how beautiful and blessed we are in Sri Lanka….
