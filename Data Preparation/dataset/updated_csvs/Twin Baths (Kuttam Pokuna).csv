The two ponds though similar in width at 15.5 metres each, differ in dimensions.  The southern pond measures 40 metres in length and 5.5 metres in depth while the northern pond is 28 metres long and 4.3 metres deep.  Historical records suggest that the ponds were constructed during two different periods between the 6th and the 9th centuries, with the smaller pond being the older.  Over time, both ponds have undergone several renovations. The ponds are remarkable for their precise construction.  Granite slabs, expertly cut and dressed, were used for the bottom, sides, terraces, and steps.  Notably no mortar was used to join the granite blocks, showcasing the advanced engineering and masonry skill of its ancient builders.  The design also features intricate stone carvings and mythical stone figures. The water is supplied to the ponds through underground ducts from a reservoir approximately 3 kilometres away.  This sophisticated system includes a filtration mechanism and a stone chamber to trap sediment.  The two ponds are interconnected by an underground duct.  The water drained from the ponds was historically used to irrigate downstream rice fields. The ponds served as bathing places for the monks residing in the monastery complex at Abhayagiri temple.  Today the Twin Ponds – Kuttam Pokuna – stand as an outstanding example of ancient technical and artistic craftmanship, as well as remarkable examples of hydraulic engineering and architecture skills of ancient Sri Lanka.","December 15, 2025",0.0,0.0

I was genuinely amazed by the architectural precision and the peaceful atmosphere surrounding this ancient royal bath. Built over 1,200 years ago for Buddhist monks, the ponds were designed with such skill that even today, the drainage system still works! The symmetry, the stonework, and the steps leading down to the water all show the brilliance of early Sri Lankan engineering. What struck me most was the sense of serenity — it’s a quiet, beautiful space where you can imagine the calm daily life of monks centuries ago. The reflections in the water, the birdsong, and the sense of history made it one of the most memorable spots on my trip. Tip: Go early in the morning to enjoy the soft light and peaceful surroundings. Don’t miss the base stones nearby that once held wooden columns — another sign of ancient innovation.","June 25, 2025",0.0,0.0

But is a beautiful place to go. It's filled up with water during the rainy time which gives a fantastic sight. This pair of pools known as Kuttam Pokuna (Twin Ponds/Pools). The said pair of pools were built by the Sinhalese in the ancient kingdom of Anuradhapura. These are considered one of the significant achievements in the field of hydro logical engineering and outstanding architectural and artistic creations of the ancient Sinhalese. A garden was landscaped which separates the two ponds which long is 18½ ft. The larger pool of the two is 132 ft by 51 ft, while the smaller pool is 91 ft by 51 ft. The depths of the two pools is 14 ft and 18 ft for the smaller pool and the larger pool respectively. Some believe that in a lovely condition evidently the Queen entered from the far end pond and the King nearer the road ornate reliefs at either end some local souvenir and drink stalls around. And the other belief is that these ponds are built inside the Abayagiriya Monastic complex. These polls used by Buddhist monks to take bath. Not for the King and Queen. ( as explained by the British archaeologists) This monastic complex having more than 50 pools. All these are for the Buddhist monks. Twins ponds are only 2 of them. This is nice witness of ancient hydraulic irrigation system from the ancient time this all historical sites used as  monasteries. These both pools were not built in the same time. Small one built earlier and later time built big one. Wonderful work of the Lankan hydronic engineers of Naga tribe. It could understand easily. Because there having 5 headed cobra pillar. That explains it was built by the Naga Tribe.  It must have been an impressive city in ancient times. Lots of interesting ruins are found around here. It is best explored by a bike early in the day. It is a great and amazing place. When you visit this place you will be surely amazed about the ability of the ancient ancestors of Sri Lanka. The carvings and all the construction is breathtaking and unbelievable. This is a beautiful place to take some photos with some different ruins and sculptures. Lots of fish in the water you can feed with. There two swimming pools built adjacent to each other. One is small and having 2 entrance to the water. Other one is bigger and having 3 entrances to water. Water was filtered and cleaned before sending to the pool. The filter system is uncovered and you can see it. The big tank gets water from the small one. There is a square tube between the 2 pools. Exit of the water only is the small one. There is a difference between the stairs. Small one stairs covered the entrance to left and right side. But that mistake was corrected in the big poll.  That explains small one built earlier than the big one. During the past, a lot of Buddhist monk practiced Buddhism reality path from here according to the evidence 5000 monk has lived here. Stone pots with carvings are found and they are decorating the entrance which enhances its beauty. I recommend you to visit it.","April 12, 2018",0.0,0.0

As this was my favourite part of Anaradhupura I thought I would allocate my review to the Kuttampokuna (twin baths). The quietness of the baths, amazing intricate nature of their design and proxinity to a very good and inexpensive small place to eat draws me to them. Also, their resident turtle was friendly and an attraction in himself. I thought that given the size of Anaradhapura a driver or in our case cycles are a necessity. I estimate we cycle about 12-15km but saw only two thirds of the area. Sign posts are lacking and it is easy to miss certain sites within the area. There is so much to see in this ancient city that it is another must see place while in this part of Sri Lanka.

The whole time I was staring at the twin baths, I kept thinking ""How could the people have afforded to build these back then? Where was the source of their wealth?"" The twin baths, after all, are very big, especially for just two people. It can thus be looked at as either a symbol of wealth and power and/or waste and frivolous spending.

But it was putty to see a few plastic bottles and many plastic bags floating on the water. The garbage pile with food waste a few yards from the pond was another thing I thought should not be there if the site needs to be protected for the future generation. The shops very close to the pond should not be allowed to operate so close.,"July 15, 2012",0.0,0.0

I would only recommend it if you were staying in Sri Lanka over 10 days or if you are a big historical/cultural buff.  The ruins at Polonuwara and Sigiriya are more impressive. The baths themselves are worth about 5-10 minutes of your time, hardly worth the amount of time taken just to get there, especially if you are using a bicycle or public transport.  They are, after all, the ruins of two baths (enter drumroll...).  The surrounding area is decidedly not tourist friendly, unless you prefer that look.  There are filthy (and closed at the time of my visit) bathroom facilities, a small shack selling a drink across the road, and lots of cows wandering about.  The area around was muddy (since it had rained recently), and the pools are not closed off.  Good as it preserves a better ""look"", but bad if you have small children. I would recommend only at the tail end of a visit to Anuradhapura, which itself I would only recommend as a bottom tier attraction within Sri Lanka.  The exorbitant entrance fees alone make you almost obligated to enter.","May 4, 2012",0.0,0.0
