It is the oldest building in Colombo, built in 1669 a fine example of 17th century Dutch colonial architecture, with 4 sides around a central courtyard, open verandahs and thick walls. Floors had terracotta tiles floors, high beamed ceilings, and airy rooms with large windows, all designed to keep the wards cool. It was the first hospital to be built by the Dutch in Asia and served officers of the Dutch East India Company and Dutch sailors. However, when the British arrived in 1796, it ceased to be a hospital and served as a military barracks. Surprisingly perhaps, the building was still in existence, due largely to its solid construction, when Sri Lanka became independent in 1948. Since then the building has been used for various purposes. Before the 1980’s is was used by the Colombo Apothecaries. It was restored in 1984 by the architect Ashley de Vos. For more than a decade, it was Fort Police station. In 1996 it suffered severe damage from then LTTE attack on the World Trade Centre and It was abandoned, fenced off and largely forgotten. It was scheduled for demolition but in 2011, it was realized that this building could be saved, if it could be put to practical use. It was converted into a smart shopping arcade in 2011 whilst retaining the Dutch Architectural style. And what a fine job they have made of it.","July 9, 2019",0.0,0.0

As I said it was probably just me not understanding how this was supposed to work. I ordered a Caesar Salad (when will I learn?).  It was not bad… it was just not a Caesar Salad.  It was the closest I’ve come to the genuine article in SL, but there were no anchovies and what in the name of all that is holy was that thing masquerading as bacon?  It definitely had never been inside a pig before, and I doubt it was even a known foodstuff.  It sorta looked like bacon might look like, if you squinted your eyes and turned off the lights.  It tasted of nothing at all and was largely, but not wholly, inedible.  In short, don’t order the Caesar Salad. Food is reasonably priced; drinks are expensive.

It is believed to have existed since 1681, built as a hospital during the Dutch occupation of Sri Lanka, it has been used for several different purposes. The Dutch established the Colombo Hospital to look after the health of the officers and other staff serving under the Dutch East India Company. The building reflects seventeenth century Dutch colonial architecture. It was the Colombo Fort Police Station from the early 1980s to 1990s, prior to which it housed the Colombo Apothecaries. In 2011 it has been transformed into small new shopping complex, where the historic architecture has been preserved. It has few nice shops, few lovely tearoom - cafes and restaurants. It's a nice place with nice ambience to stop and enjoy shopping and a cold tea in the shade under the low tiled roofs and attractive colonnades.","May 28, 2016",0.0,0.0

If you enjoy Japanese, the Japanese restaurant; Ikoi Tei is a good place to dine. However I find the shopping there to be rather expensive, as it caters to tourists, hence if your looking to buy souvenirs I'd say the best is go to a place like Lakpahana or Laksala, as they are more reasonable.","May 25, 2016",0.0,0.0
