Sudgala is actually a water slide ,not a water fall. Further ,this is one scenic location for a safe bathing even in the rainy season as the width of the massive rock face negates the impact of a sudden increase in water .It's not just  the slide which adds to the absolutely picture post card beauty of the place and surroundings. The fully grown pine forest ,the near by rail track and the ever abundant bird life complement loads to this hidden wonder in a sparsely populated region. Access is comfortably easy with just one bus ride from the nearby Nawalapitiya town ,and then a three wheeler ride or a beautiful walk up to the riverside. Nawalapitiya could easily be the next Ella ,and Sudugala is just one attraction in the list.","May 14, 2019",0.0,0.0

Not exactly a waterfall, because there's no free falling of water stream is found. The specialty is, the river is flowing here from a height and gradually down on a rock surface. It creates a scenic water flows all over the 50-60 m wide rock. Meaning of the name is ""Sudu"" = white, ""Gala"" = Rock. ""White Rock"". When water is scattered all over the wide rock it seems like a white rock. Also has several shallow natural pools for safe bathing. Village people say it is safe for bathing even during rainy season. Can do water sliding as well. Village people are coming to bathe in the afternoon. So, better to get their advice before dipping in to pools. Reaching the place is not difficult. From Nawalapitiya, take the ""Weligampola"" road, pass ""Bawwagama"" and railway crossing. Just after it, you can find a bridge. There is a road to left hand side before the bridge which runs to Heightenford. After 1 km, the place is found. Buses are operating from Nawalapitiya. There is direct bus to Heightenford but not operating regularly. There are buses to Bawwagama, Weligampola and Mapakanda. But you have to get down at Heightenford road and take a Three wheeler taxi or walk. There's train halting place at Heightenford. But not all the trains are stopping here. You can call Nawalapitiya railway station and get train details. During weekdays, there's a train around 2:15 pm which stops at Heightenford and running toward Haputhale. By that train you can travel to next station ""Inguruoya"" and get train to Kandy or Colombo Fort. This place is fine for bathing. Small group trips are recommended.","April 9, 2018",0.0,0.0
