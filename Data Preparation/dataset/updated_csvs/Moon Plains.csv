Entrance is LKR 100 for adults and LKR 50 for children. A safari jeep is required to reach the viewpoint and costs LKR 3,000 for a 30-minute ride -totally worth it. Private cars, vans, and buses are not allowed. Motorbikes are permitted but not recommended because the road is currently damaged and slippery due to rain.","November 25, 2025",0.0,0.0

First at all, there is no need of safari jeep service, any good vehicle would do the job. It's only a way created for making a living for some / few people. They charge entrance fees and again for safari jeep. Jeep can accommodate 6 personal. You can team up with other tourists at the site and share the fee but, those greedy safari guides and drivers are not encouraging it, also tried to get a chunk of money from us for no reason. If you are not visiting as a group of 6, try to group up at the site. Alsonif you are a foreigner, you may pay quite a large amount more than local travellers, so don't waste a tip for those safari riders or guides. They are not allowing foreigners to team up with locals because they are always hoping to get money from you as tips or pretending to be guiding or any other means.

The driver lets you 20 minutes there, to admire the scenery, take pictures and so on. The view around is really nice, but everything is surrounded by fences, as they say this is for delimiting the jungle from the agricultural terrains and avoiding the entrance of wild animals on the fields. If you could go by foot, that would be much better, but with the jeep I do not see any charm in it. You are also restricted by time, which I hate it, honestly...If I would have known how this is organized, for sure I would have gone in another place. So, if your time in Nuwara Eliya is limited, Moon Plains is not something you should die for to see it.","March 14, 2020",0.0,0.0

Water falls out of the mountain tops make our minds relax for a while. Tea plantations runs to the infinity make us so attractive and stick to the area and to the little country.

Entry fee: LKR 400 per pax (tourists) ; LKR 50 (locals) ; LKR 2K (total cost of one jeep: 5-7 pax) Duration: 45 mins - 1 hour I visited Moon Plains in the Month of March, at around 3:00 pm. Mornings are the ideal time to visit. But I was definitely fortunate, to get a great view in the afternoon! Once there, you cannot use your own vehicle to drive up.  There are designated jeep drivers, to drive you around. Along the way, pretty plains/hills and wild buffaloes can be observed. Having lived in the city for years, this was my chance to experience a jeep drive. So the bumpy drive, was definitely not a bother! Once you reach the farthest place, the tour guide takes you to the top most view point (there will be a little trek). From here one can get a magnificent view, of Lanka's 9 mountains. - Advance booking isn't mandatory. - Women shouldn't go here alone. - Clothing that are suited for trekking are ideal. It is advisable to carry a jacket, as it can get cold. - Do not forget to carry a bottle of water. - P. S. Moon Plains is located in a secluded place & there are no eateries around. - P. S.

The drive to the view point is through 3km of potato seed fields, farmed in an intensely chemical way, so much so that the stench from the pesticides they were spraying was often overwhelming.  This intense farming runs right the way up to the view point, a little viewing tower on top of a small hill.  The view from the viewpoint is absolutely outstanding however.
