In other words, it’s free entry to this one. I guess it’s largely because it remains a practising place of worship. This means (a) much has been restored and (b) you have to take off your shoes and headwear. Good for a 20-minute walk-around. Despite recent restorations, there are stone fragments from long ago. These are worth a closer look. There's also a colourful myth attached to the founding of this place; read it up. General info about places in the “Sacred City/Ancient Ruins” park: The sights are quite spread out such that while walking from one sight to the second may be possible, covering many more on foot is impractical. You’ll need a bicycle or a tuktuk hired for the day. Also, there’s little shade from the sun, few places to buy water and even fewer toilets. Be prepared.","May 27, 2018",0.0,0.0
