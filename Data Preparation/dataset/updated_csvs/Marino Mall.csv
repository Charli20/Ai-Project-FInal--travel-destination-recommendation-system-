The food court looks nice especially with the outdoor area but the Far Eastern restaurant we tried sucked big time. We placed an order for the family only to find out that the ice tea on their menu should be taken from a different outlet, it seemed weird as it was printed on their menu. However the staff should be trained in handling their customers better.

We drop in on a poya evening so no liquor was served, but the food was good. Only minus point is that most of the people visiting the mall just walk through the restaurant to get view of the surroundings. So the privacy of the diners and sometimes limited. Especially in the open restaurant.","October 26, 2018",0.0,0.0

In the Marino Mall, they bring you right inside the shop. And it is pretty confusing. Whoever has thought this mall out, should have had a look at other malls... to get the idea. Lots of possibilities for arcade games, but for shopping, there is much left to be desired. Good for 1 visit not for a 2nd one.","October 19, 2018",0.0,0.0

Although they say it’s 9D cinema it’s about 7D in actual. But the best part is the 8th floor restaurant, actually they have two main restaurants in 8th floor. One is Chinese restaurant and the second one is a semi open bar and restaurant. Food is up to the standard, clean neat and nice and compare to other bars near by this seems to be more economical however there is no attractive view even though it’s a open bar (as construction going on near by and you can hardly see the beach view as  hotel is next to you ) Waiters dressed well and well mannered,with live music 🎼 Overall worth visit g again It cost me around LKR 1450 per person  for the night out. Depends with what you order obviously 😃","October 15, 2018",0.0,0.0

It's not a crazy happening place with Soo much of stalls but the places there are decent and affordable it's a good place to kill time with friends when bored. What I truly love are the restaurants they are really good, affordable and tasty and the portions are very generous. It's super fun to sit there during a rainy day because the winds are crazy. Lovely view with the refreshing sea breeze. It's definitely worth a visit we should support local enterprises stepping into big developments like this.","October 13, 2018",0.0,0.0

There are elevators all around, most of them are out of order or emergency only and they are too small for a huge mall,maximum 5-6 people fit in. also lifts are extreamly slow. Atmosphere is dull, shops, lighting and decorations could have been more trendy and modern. Food court seems lost, prices are reasonable but quality is low. Nothing much interesting and nothing tempting on display. Cleanliness can be improved. It's sad to see a massive new property like this failing even to meet average customer  expectation.
