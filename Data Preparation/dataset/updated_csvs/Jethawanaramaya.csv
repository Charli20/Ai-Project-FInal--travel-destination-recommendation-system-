Constructed by King Mahasena (273–301 AD), the stupa was once the tallest in the world at 122 meters and the third tallest structure globally, surpassed only by the pyramids of Egypt. It was restored in the 12th century by King Parakramabahu to its current height of 71 meters. Jethawanaramaya remains a sacred site for Buddhists and a powerful symbol of faith.  Following tradition, we walked clockwise around the stupa.  Buddhists among us, joined the crowds offering flowers and chanting pirith (Buddhist stanzas), venerating Buddha and his teachings and enjoying the serene, peaceful and tranquil atmosphere at the temple. Visitors to the stupa wear modest clothing that covers shoulders and knees.  They also remove their footwear before entry.","January 8, 2026",0.0,0.0

Built by King Mahasena in the 3rd century AD, this massive brick stupa once stood over 122 meters (400 feet) tall, making it the tallest stupa in the ancient world and one of the largest brick structures ever built. Jetavanaramaya belongs to the Jetavana Monastery complex, a UNESCO World Heritage Site that served as a major center for Buddhist learning, meditation, and pilgrimage. The stupa is believed to enshrine a relic of the Buddha’s belt, adding deep religious significance to its grandeur. Today, Jetavanaramaya remains a must-visit attraction in Anuradhapura for travelers seeking Sri Lanka’s cultural heritage, Buddhist history, and ancient architectural marvels. Surrounded by serene landscapes and timeless ruins, it stands as a symbol of spiritual devotion and engineering brilliance in Sri Lanka’s glorious past.","November 3, 2025",0.0,0.0

Due, perhaps, to disputes between various factions of Sri Lanka Buddhism religious orders,  the stupa is believed to have been flattened and is said to be rebuilt by ancient kings to the current  reduced height of about 300'. Even with reduced height, the stupa is impressive and well preserved. The atmosphere is calm and quiet and the visitors and the pilgrims alike maintain the peaceful atmosphere of the monument. The stupa looks almost similar to the Abhayagiri Stupa which is nearby except for the top cone which seems to have been truncated due to lightening strike. It is suggested that suitable directions / sign boards could be placed at the entrances for the navigation of foreigners. Must visit while you are in Anuradhapura. Recommended.","September 22, 2025",0.0,0.0
