The temple has swayambu (natural and not man made) moorthis of Ram, Lakshman and Sita- the main sannadhi as described by the priest. The other idols are gifted by India if I remember it right. The best part was visiting the Ashok Vatika next to the temple. The huge pits there are believed to be the foot marks of Hanuman. The entire atmosphere is a proof of the fact that nature is so beautiful. We also saw a lot of monkeys there which made us sail into the Ramayana world for few minutes.

The temple itself was small, but it was still a great experience to witness a part of mythology. There was a small entry fee to the temple; I believe it was 200 for 2 people. As is customary, visitors are required to leave their footwear outside. The temple has a designated area for this. Inside, there was a lunch service taking place, and visitors can donate to support this service. Various idols of Ram, Hanuman, and Seetha were present inside. The main attraction was the Hanuman Ji footprint, which is located in an area outside the temple.

Here, at the Sītā Amman Kồvil, a quaint little Kồvil, we had the MOST DIVINE DARŚAN of ŚRĪ SĪTĀ DÉVI (to Whom primarily this Kồvil is dedicated) - ŚRĪ RĀMA - ŚRĪ LAKŞMAṆA - ŚRĪ HANUMĀN and ŚRĪ SUGRĪVA. At this very  location Śrī Sītā Dévi - Divine Consort of Lord ŚRĪ RĀMA - was held captive in hiding by the demon King Rāvaṇa of Lanka. When I visited this spot about 25 years ago while on a professional visit there was no structure worth the name and it seemed a total lack of respect for Śrī Sītā Dévi, on the part of the then Sri Lankan government authorities. But now, it is such a big complex that has been beautified so well! There is a small stream behind the Temple where Śrī Sītā Dévi is said to take Her bath. A bridge across the stream takes us to the spot where she was seated and being engaged in conversation by Śrī Hanumānji. The scenario was re-created by live model statues of Śrī Sītā Dévi and Śrī Hanumān. This is the only Temple in the whole world that is dedicated to Śrī Sītā Dévi, but the Sanctum Sanctorum consists of the idols of Lord Śrī Rāma, Śrī Sītā Dévi, Śrī Lakşmaṇa and Śrī Sugrīva. Just on the opposite side of the main temple complex is the Temple dedicated to Śrī Ānjanéya, facing his Lord Śrī Rāma. Out of the 13 Palaces of Rāvaṇa, two caves in the Strict Nature Reserve of Hakgala, starting from the Temple land and the cave at Ella, close to the mighty (1080 feet in height) waterfall “Rāvaṇa-Ella” where Rāvaṇa went for bathing, are supposed to be the three places where Śrī Sītā Dévi was kept in hiding. There are other deities in the complex. When we reached there, the day being Śrī Saraswati Puja Day of the Dasara, there were lots of Hindu school children who were performing pūja to a big photo of Goddess Śrī  Saraswati Dévi, placed in the Main Temple. We had to wait till their pūja was over before our offerings were accepted. In all, it was a very very fulfilling occasion and our hearts were satiated with UNTOLD JOY being in such HOLY SURROUNDINGS that were in effect – scenes from the Holy Epic Śrīmad Rāmāyaṇa that we mentally visualized and felt supremely happy being devoted to Lord Śrī Rāma – Śrī Sītā – Śrī Lakşmaṇa and Śrī Hanumān.  It was our singular luck that we were blessed with the Most Unique Divine Darśan at this MOST SACRED SPOT IN SRI LANKA!","November 14, 2017",0.0,0.0
