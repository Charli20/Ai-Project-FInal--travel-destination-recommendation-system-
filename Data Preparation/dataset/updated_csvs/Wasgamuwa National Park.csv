We had an awesome cook the place we stayed... we got the ingredients and they made the food...  we stayed in a bungalow sort of which was open to the outside ... I highly recommend a portable mosquito net (this is to keep out not only the mosy but other insects that come at night when sleeping) that can be folded and taken on trips you can get them from arpico super store... Also each time before you goto sleep please lift the bed mattresses and check underneath for any insects also get some mosquito repellant as well... :D,"October 18, 2023",0.0,0.0

The accessible parts are mostly regrowth scrub, following years of dispersed grazing and hunting, altho there are also some high quality damp forests on the less accessible lower mountain slopes (also part of the national park). The standard Sri Lankan large animals are all too easily seen, notably elefants, buffalo, spotted deer, crocodiles and others, plus PLENTY of bird life and even a few varieties of snakes.  You may be lucky enough to catch leopards (altho these can never be guaranteed). It's a bit 'off the beaten track', best accessible via Dambulla and the park itself can be accessed by jeep safari (including park guide).  We stayed at the nearby Safari Lodge (a great location - more on that later). It's a great alternative to Yala.  In Wasgamuwa you can see the wildlife in natural habitat without the swarms of tourists that harry the wildlife in better known parks, such as Yala.

We did a lot of research and eventually chose Wasgamuwa. We were not disappointed. The park was beautiful and full of all sorts of wildlife. We saw many different types of birds and butterflies, as well as wild bore, crocodiles, lizards and monkeys. We were desperate to see elephants, which we did eventually. We were one of only a handful of jeeps in the park that day and the only jeep in the area as we watched a herd of 15-20 elephants slowly emerge from the jungle. It was spectacular. There were a few things we wish we’d know beforehand, however. 1) Tickets cost $10 US for foreigners. You also have to pay 40RPs for your driver, 250RPs for the jeep and a service charge of $8 US which includes a guide from the park. Our guide really knew his stuff and was very helpful (apart from when he fell asleep for 5 minutes!). 2) As soon as you arrive, a jeep driver will offer you a price for a jeep and try to make you agree instantly. Take your time. There was only 1 jeep when we arrived, but there were more waiting outside, so don’t feel you need to agree. Another jeep will come and you can say you’ll just wait if a driver is asking too much money. We settled on 6500RPs for 3hrs but ended up giving 7000 because we stayed in the park a lot longer. I think we probably overpaid though. 3) Elephants and other wildlife start to come out after the heat of the day, around 2-3pm, so aim to start your safari around then and not too much before. 4) We weren’t very impressed with the bathroom facilities or other amenities on arrival.

If you do you now what I am talking about. Me and my friends went camping in Wasgamuwa National Park. You need to book the lace in advance from the forest department(colombo - battaramulla). It was Rs. 2100 I think. We took the bus from fort at 12 midnight and went to Mahiyanganaya. Once we went there there is a bus that goes close to the jungle. Get down on the last stop and hire a jeep. there are plenty of jeeps to hire around. Make sure you pick the right ones coz they will be with the vehicle all the night with a guide. There is a campsite call ""Thunmang handiya"" which is close to the Mahaweli river. Camp there and the view is breath taking. Take a look at the pics. Also when we hire the jeep we are entitled to go for a safari as well. We saw a lot of elephants and birds. then out of no where a leopard cross the road as well. The night time in the jungle was amazing. We heard so many animal's sounds and enjoyed the sound of the river that flow next to our tents. The jeep was parked and ready in case of emergencies. The guid and the driver stayed at the jeep and they didn't bother our privacy. Make sure you take enough food for those two as well. When ever we want and feel we jump in to the water and the water level is not even up to your hip. water is clean. We didn't drink, but we use for the cleaning. Take drinking water. Also there is a toilet if you are not an outdoor person. In the morning we saw elephants crossing the river. It was amazing with the morning sunrise. Overall its a great experience and I hope you guys will like to try. One more thing don't pollute anything around. Be responsible and take all the garbage with you. Also when cleaning try to minimize soap and other chemicals as there are fish in the river. The sand in the river is a good soap to clean your plates.","September 29, 2018",0.0,0.0

Catching the 5:30am safari was well worthwhile as we got to witness the sun rising over the stunning landscape. We also had a tracker, as well as a driver, which made sure we saw as many animals as possible. The backdrop of the Knuckles mountain range created a breath taking backdrop that neither of us will ever forget.","September 25, 2018",0.0,0.0

Regarding wildlife, it was ok, we saw a group of elephants in a lake (but a bit far distance from our jeep), wild buffalos, deers, and many types of birds. What we did not like about the safari was the following. The guide was in the back of the jeep with us and each time he spotted some animal, he needed to hit the jeep to let the driver know to stop which was messy and animals got scared and run away. Not sure if this is the standard procedure (hopefully not and we just were not lucky with our driver). Also the duration of the safari was only 90 minutes when I think it usually takes at least 2 hours, but it must be a problem of our travel agency.","September 10, 2018",0.0,0.0

Good surface area with animals such as: Elephants, deers, and plenty of birds. The park organizes two main safaris one between 6-9 am and the other between 3-6 pm, so make sure you are there around those times, otherwise you will be lingering around for a while and not much to do on foot really. You will have to pay park entrance of about 2500 rupee, and also pay to rent a jeep (we paid 4000 rupee to rent a jeep for 3 hours. Add to these costs tips for driver and tracker/ guide. There is no cafeteria and so I suggest you bring your own food and drinks with you, as the closest store is in about 2-3 kms. What you will see on the safari in terms of fauna is not impressive ( Nothing compared to what you would see in a Safari in Africa). Nevertheless, it is relaxing and very enjoyable. You will actually get to see a couple of cool birds. Apparently they have bungalows should one decide to stay overnight, but I didn't get the impression the park was well equipped, so you do that at your own risk! Guide was very friendly and helpful but sadly below average English, and that did restrict the amount of information we could gather about the park's natural flora and fauna. Overall, if you want a relaxing safari and do not have very high expectations as to how many animals you will see and how close you can get to them, it is a good place to go.","January 5, 2017",0.0,0.0

Some of them even gave a go at us once we lingered too much amidst the. There was a ""Loner"" called ""Bonnet"" who was very popular since the elephant used to attack jeep bonnets. Fortunately it didn't attack ours. If you're an elephant lover this is a very good place to visit. However if you want a diversified safari, then I think this is not your cup of tea. We witnessed many spotted deer, wild boar & monkeys as well.","June 17, 2013",0.0,0.0

Upon desperation from boredom, we decided, despite the really high prices, to join the safari. Ok, so you have to pay for the Jeep, the entrance fee etc. For 2 people, its a little over US 100. For that, you get to see, some elephants kicking and eating grass, some birds and ALOT of other Jeeps. It's fascinating to see your first elephants, but after that, its just more elephants, and more elephants. It's hard to enjoy them with the sounds of other Jeeps and exhaust. Altogether, I left feeling a tad unsatisfied. I am glad i saw them, but I wasn't sure if the price justified it.","August 9, 2012",0.0,0.0

Probably the easiest to get there from Colombo is through Kurunagala, Dambulla, Bakamuna, Hettipola. The road is not as pictures as the road from Matale through Riverstone and then to Hettipola but probably quicker to reach the destination. You should book the bungalows through Wild Life (-----) to stay in the Park as that is the best way as you could get out early to the forest to see animals. Even you could go camping as it is facilitated through Wild Life. Two out of the three bungalows as well as the camping site is closer to Mahaweli river. There are accommodation outside the Park as well and you could easily get a safari jeep. The roads in the Park are not that bad and you can use a jeep with two wheel drive. You could see animals closer to the nature than some of the other Parks as Wasgamuwa is not that crowded by visitors probably due to the distance from Colombo. It was great to see many numbers of elephants roaming around and checking you and your vehicle out to see whether you are a friend or an enemy!!  There are leopards, bears, deer’s, different types of birds and other animals. Visit, enjoy, don’t leave anything!!","December 29, 2011",0.0,0.0
