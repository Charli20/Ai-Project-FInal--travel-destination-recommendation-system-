We had a spacious room ground floor (4 rooms are connected with 2 on ground floor and 2 on 1st floor) and these are on a beautiful avenue. Cleaning twice a day. Swimming pool is top notch, but a dip in the ocean is definitely also recommended. Breakfast in large room is fine. Dinner we did 1x on the beach at the hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We also started to walk on the left side of the beach and then after more than fifteen minutes you arrive at some very nice beach bars. Highly recommended to eat there.","August 27, 2025",0.0,0.0

The beach is a few kilometers long, and is better equipped than the nearby Nilaveli. There are several proposals for water sports and diving. There are also places to stop for a snack or a cocktail in the evening. It is frequented by both tourists and people of Trincomalee, so very lively, but still it is so vast that you can find peace if you just want a little relaxation. The sea is not crystal clear but still clean and not excessively dangerous due to currents and waves. Recommended for a few days at sea after a tour in Sri Lanka.","September 25, 2024",0.0,0.0

Maybe I'm spoilt coming from Australia, but I've travelled a bit and can honestly say this rates in the bottom of the list for beaches I've enjoyed swimming at. The sand has a horrible blackness inside it spoiling its attempt at white colour. There is a polluted river washing in from its northern end and nearly all ""storm water"" from the city runs directly into the beach at regular intervals. It is populated with incredibly overpriced dining options, and touts wanting you to take a diving trip with them. We saw a dead dog not 100metres from the most expensive resort in the area.

Bottles, cans, cartons, straws, plastic bags, dead chickens, burger containers - I could go on and on. It's utterly disgusting. These things also find their way into the sea, and after a while I decided not to swim in it, it was far too dirty. I observed the fishermen throw all their rubbish on the sand and discard dead puffer fish by just leaving them on the sea edge for someone to tread on. The sea is their rubbish bin. They wait for the tide to take it out but their nets were full of trash as well as fish. They literally are catching their own rubbish. I also saw tourists who should know better leave their empty cigarette packets and water bottles on the beach. Open your eyes to how things really are, not how you want to see them.

It´s still some beach tirsty tourist strolling around and blending in with local fishermen pulling their nets on to the beach in the afternoon. The beach is vast and deep with a lot of space and around the restaurants and resorts they clean the beach every day (you can still find patches in between with some garbage that floated ashore). The beach meet some swell in the middle but are more calm in the north and the south side. You´ll might struggle with finding a good place to eat but there is a good and fairly priced restaurant called the Crab on the beach´s north end that hold local food to a high standard, check it out! If you like to go for a little adventere you can wade over the stream where the lagoon meets the ocean and find a private little beach and much more =)","November 16, 2016",0.0,0.0

Good backpacker atmosphere. There are a few not so well priced restaurants but with great food. At nights, fresh fish is cooked on grills. We had a lovely three day break from seeing temple after temple. I expect that in a couple of years, it won't be as authentic as it is now, so enjoy it while it lasts! Fishermen can be seen bringing their nets in full of fish. Amazing experience!","September 20, 2016",0.0,0.0

Still genuine, fishermen working on the beach, not too much tourist, even if a huge part of the beach is surrounded by hotels and guesthouse. Such as other places in Sri Lanka, it smells sometimes the benzine, and some restaurants/places such as Fernando's bar are transformed to loud and noisy disco bar as from 7PM, with a boring beat sound and flashing multicolour lights polluting the whole beach and any stars watching moment you would like to be romantic. So this is definitely a place to discover as it is still authentic, but let's hope that development of tourism will go in a positive direction","August 30, 2016",0.0,0.0

Sand is soft. Beach is clean. A few water sport places (shake watching, scuba diving etc) too. Twice a day watch the fishermen haul in their nets and sell their catch on the beach to local restaurants and hotels. Came here in August and the sea was clear and calm enough for swimming (but be prepared to do a bit of wave jumping!) Currently this place is very under developed. No high rise hotels, chain hotels or rowdy bars.","August 25, 2016",0.0,0.0
