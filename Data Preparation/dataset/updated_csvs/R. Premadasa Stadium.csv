A heavy police presence greets you, as you approach the stadium, which is situated in a run down area of Colombo. Tickets for the match, only became available from the official Sri Lankan Cricket Club site, a couple of weeks before the game.  Why do they advertise tickets so late, is beyond me, it's so frustrating! Large amounts of the ground were unavailable (for example behind the bowler's arm), presumably either pre-booked by tour companies, or reserved for the local fans. After being searched, I was allowed to enter the stadium and made my way to my seat, via the beer stall. The beer was sold in small beakers and was blooming awful.  The type of beer, you'd expect, on a very cheap, all inclusive holiday. The ground was about a tenth full, so there was no atmosphere at all.  The locals prefer T20. To make things worse, not only were England playing abysmally, I had some tiresome yobs, sitting close by, who kept shouting for any nearby fielding English player, to give them a wave.  If they did, then they got a cheer, if not, a boo and abuse. It was not good natured banter, but just boring and moronic. The highlight was the Sri Lankan mascot, who came into the stand, accompanied by a small band.  He was excellent, especially considering the heat and how hot he must of been in that suit. I left after ten overs ...... no atmosphere, England hopeless, rotten beer and the final straw the ""Giv us a wave, water boy,"" directed at Eoin Morgan, who was not playing, but giving a drink, to a teammate on the boundary.","November 4, 2018",0.0,0.0

We booked premier seats in the grand stand and looked forward to a great evening out for the family. We eventually got to our allotted seats and someone was sat in them. We were told by a young Male that the seats were taken and tried to move us on.  Clearly we refused and stayed in our seats. What transpired thereafter was a shambles. In a nutshell we discovered that the 5 row of seats in front of us including ours had been pre-purchased or bought fraudulently for a crowd of rowdy young males who had clearly purchased tickets underhand. Several families turned up claiming their spaces but were ushered away by the young men. We saw the young men taking off seat numbers to disguise the seats. There was no order and as the match proceeded the young men became more rowdy drinking alcohol from large water bottles full of alcohol. It became quite stressful for us as we could no longer see the match and were completely intimidated. We tried to seek assistance from officials and the police but absolutely no one remotely cared. In the end we left the event early to avoid the huge crowds leaving the stadium as we realised the exits would be equally unsafe. Such a shame as the atmosphere in the stadium itself was exciting but massively spoilt by unruly and disrespectful spectators. A very disappointing evening in the end.,"August 20, 2018",0.0,0.0

We were advised to arrive early. With the game scheduled to start at 7pm we made arrangements to leave our hotel around 4pm. The drive to the access road took around 15 mins after which we realised that the access roads were in fact closed. Our guide managed to turn the car around and find a parking lot really close by which costs around 250lkr for the evening. Apparently its arranged by the municipality but by the looks of it , was some random arrangement that was made between the cops and the shop owners. In any event, we took the walk down a narrow access road towards the stadium. We arrived on Maligawatta lane and made our way to the gates. And then up and up and up again to our seats. The stands are quite steep with large stairs and this may make it difficult if going with kids as we discovered. Word of advice, there are a few small stores opposite the entrances in Maligawatta Lane. Buy snacks before you go in. In many parts of the stadium the food vendors just simply do not go to. The elevated sections seem to be particularly ignored by them possibly due to the work required to get up and down and then still negotiate a pack stand with a crazy incline. During the international games it seems there is a huge police presence which means very few if any access controls are bypassed. Unlike the game in Pallekelle our area was limited to ticket holders with the correct access , and personally saw them turning away people with differnet areas marked on their tickets. The visibility all round this stadium is great. Noise levels are as expected although the addition of a band with steel instruments was at times a bit louder than it needed to be. Overall we had a great evening out. We witnessed a collapse and a comeback in the game and ultimately Australia walked out deserved winners after a big scare. Was also T.M. Dilshan's last international game so was great to see that first hand at a ground that has so much of history to Sri Lankan cricket. Next stop the SSC Colombo...","September 10, 2016",0.0,0.0

Premadasa AKA Keththarama stadium is the second biggest cricket ground in Sri Lanka. It was established in 1986 as Keththarama Stadium and after the death of Late President Ranasinghe Premadasa  the founder of the stadium, in 1994, the stadium renamed as R. Premadasa Stadium. Stadium is located in Maligawatta, Colombo 08 and the best way to come there is by using the Baseline road and get a tuk tuk (nearly 150-200 lkr). Other than that it is easier to come from Maradana, Panchikawatte junction and get a tuk tuk(nearly 150-200 lkr). There are no direct bus route to come to the ground. The ground has 5 seating areas named as Grand Stand, Block A-D. All the stands have upper tier and lower tier seating. If you want to get the best view of the play, my suggestion is right hand corners of upper tiers of Block C and Block B and left hand corners of the upper tiers of Block A and Block D. Those areas gives you the real cricket feeling (like watching it on TV). The Grand Stand is good but it costs much. The experience you can get from the ground is amazing. There will be almost 35K crowd for a match when Sri Lanka is playing. The crowd is electrified and you can hear all kind of Papare music and DJs too. Lot of dancing, singing and other party related things happening during the cricket match. There are some food outlets and beer stalls there but the prices are bit high from the standard prices. You can get food and beverages from the out side of the ground but not liquor. Beer is the only thing you can get but again no out side beer. There are many public toilets for both men and women and the condition is quite good. This is the best place to get the cricket fun in Sri Lanka. Be there and feel it.","May 26, 2016",0.0,0.0

Premadasa stadium a few times to watch international cricket matches. Last time was during the South Africa tour to Sri Lanka. Ground is large and has the capacity for a crowd over 30,000. Good view can be expected from Grand Stand, A Upper, B Upper blocks as well as C and D Upper Blocks. A Lower and B lower will give you close action to the stadium. C and D lower blocks will not have seats and just the concrete seating with no back rest which is not comfortable. Always make sure you go to the grounds well in advance if it is an International cricket match with Sri Lanka as it can be a huge crowd and getting in to the ground can be a nightmare. Last time we had a terrible time getting in as we were late. If you drive to the place, parking can be difficult as well. Unless you go very early you will not be able to park in official park. You can park close to grounds in the roads of Maligawatta. However beware that the residents will collect money from you for parking (about 300Rs) and do not try to argue with them as the neighborhood is not friendly. My advise is to take a tuk-tuk or taxi if possible. During a cricket match, food, drinks and beer stalls will be available in all stands also the music. If you know what cricket is, this is a must see place during a cricket match as the atmosphere will be really festive.","December 26, 2013",0.0,0.0

We had tickets for the Grandstand - category 1 tickets which only cost about USD18 each. Perfect location to watch the cricket in the afternoon and evening, as the sun is behind the grandstand, so no direct sunlight at all - which is a good thing! You are also directly opposite the scoreboard. Beer, soft drinks, ice creams, fast food - all located at the top of the Grandstand area, and also from the roaming vendors who walk the aisles. Just make sure you have lots of small notes to buy food with early on, as the vendors won't have much change to break large notes until later in the day. Toilet facilities were pretty good during the first match, but quickly deteriorated by the second match. Didn't really notice any cleaners about, which is probably my only area of feedback for improvement. Note - If you get tickets that sit on the side of the scoreboard (cheapest tickets for the stadium) you will be in direct full sunlight for day matches.","October 17, 2012",0.0,0.0

Thinks its C and D section. Very uncomfortable but the atmosphere was electric with Sri Lanka in the final. Well done West Indies. Not in the nicest area of Colombo but the children around the stadium were very friendly!,"October 13, 2012",0.0,0.0
