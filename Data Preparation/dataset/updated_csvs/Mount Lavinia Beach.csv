The former grandeur of this once beautiful hotel has crumbled away. The room was not particularly clean, the bathroom smelt, no hand towel, no bath mat, the a/c barely worked, the fridge barely worked, the safe did not work, the beach bar area deserted and ruined.

My happy memories of it being the place to stay were sadly dashed, and I will not return nor recommend to anyone else.","November 20, 2025",0.0,0.0

The hotel is in a stunning location with amazing views over the beach. The hotel is obviously very old but has been modernised to a decent standard. The food was absolutely stunning with an amazing choice, spread over two rooms, best we encountered on our stay in the country. However the service in the restaurant was really poor. It was difficult to order a drink at the table and very slow to arrive once ordered. Used plates were not cleared and were allowed to pile up on the table. Such a shame as the food was so good. Finally as it was the last night of our tour and we were all going our seperate ways the following day we decided to go for a few drinks outside around the pool. Could not get anyone to take the drinks order until we went and found a reluctant waiter who took one look at the size of the goup, took the the first couple of orders and just left us sitting there whilst he went and started clearing plates from other tables which was quite ironic following our experiences in the restaurant. Eventually someone went and got a manager who did take the order but the drinks were very slow to arrive. In some cases well over 30 minutes. Such a shame that this level of service lets down the hotel, and spoilt what should have been a pleasant evening at the end of our tour.","March 7, 2019",0.0,0.0

Unfortunately when we arrived they had messed up our booking so thought we were due to stay the next evening. Once they had realised this was incorrect it was sorted pretty quickly and consequently I think we actually got a room upgrade, after all it was our honeymoon. The hotel has a nice pool which also has some amazing sea views. It has its own beach and a number of other facilities. I got the impression however, that despite the very impressive entrance and grand nature of the hotel it was quite tired and dated. If I’m honest it needs quite a significant amount of investment to bring it back to its former glory. The staff also failed to make the best impression - there seemed a lack of coordination and knowledge, for example when we received a call to say our driver had arrived we returned to reception only to find no one seemed to know who our driver was or had any recollection of the fact they’d called us. We ate in the seafood restaurant on the beach which was lovely and very good value for money. You weigh out your fish and it’s cooked to how you like it, id defiantly recommend this. Breakfast in the Grovenors restaurant was a bit of a shambles. Whilst the food was okay  we were put out by the very poor service - we were not seated so tried to find our own seat to find all of them had reserved signs. When we had no option but to sit in one of these we were confronted with a very cross waiter who told us to move but could not suggest a seat. Not ideal!

I immediately got approached by a man who wanted to be a guide and he followed me along the beach and pushed me for a bribe saying it was his beach. Eventually I got rid of him only to be approached by someone else. I was about to leave and take the train back to Colombo but found access to the beach on the South side of the hotel which was totally amazing and really beautiful. Completely recommend and the trains were interesting to take if you like getting off the normal touristy areas.

Beach was rammed the whole time I was there and not much else around other than taking a quick look at the Mount Lavinia Hotel although why anyone would stay there is beyond me as some lovely small hotels in vicinity. If you walk to North end of beach there is a great place to watch the locals fishing but - as with most fishermen - they tend to look at you as an unnecessary nuisance so keep your distance. Sadly saw a young woman get mobbed and groped on the beach by a crowd of young lads who seem to roam around far too regularly.

Mt Lavinia Hotel was on our must do list of places to see. THe legendary story of the famous dancer and the conservative Englishman who fell in love and lived in this former governors mansion has become the stuff of legend We arrived around 6 pm into the large lobby of this iconic hotel and walked immediately to the beach. There we kicked off our shoes and ran onto the sands which were clean and free of glass pieces and shards.. what we encounter in many Indian beaches.. The beachside sea food restaurant was brimming with fresh fish and the staff welcomed us with a lovely MOCKTAIL. THe beach was not crowded and the breeze was gentle and almost dreamlike. This was a great curtain raiser for an evening that took us to the large buffet inside the hotel Walking on the sands and listening to the waves crash onto the brown sands.. the ebb and rise of the tide.. getting our feet wet and feeling the sand squish amidst our toes.. Our group of women ranging from ages 38 to 63 were in various stages of girlish delight Do visit Mount Lavinia beach before you dine or drink. This is like a superb trailer for the main feature that is the incredible island of Sri Lanka,"July 4, 2017",0.0,0.0

First impression was great, nice staff, room etc everything you'd expect from hotel of this quality. However, when we arrived at 5 pm we asked to book a table in the a la carte restaurant for 7.30 we were told it was full booked, We asked if we could have a table on the terrace or elsewhere and were told everywhere full. So we finally agreed after some discussion we could have a table at 9pm. When we arrive no one knew anything about it....but we did get a table where we sat for some time before a wine waiter appeared. We ordered a bottle of Fizz and waited, and waited after 20 minutes our bottle and bucket appeared  but no.... the waiter disappeared again! By now the couple on the table next to us had noticed, they were still waiting for their a la carte food to arrive. My husband then opened our bottle and we were on the second glass before the waiter re-appeared. It was now nearly 10 pm and our neighbours food had appeared and was promptly rejected as cold. So we went for the buffet - not great but we could find something to eat. It was very average more 3* than 5*. Our neighbour was a business man who frequently stayed at the Hotel and said he had never experienced anything  like it before we concluded the hotel was suffering from too many guests and not enough staff. There seemed to be a lot of ""groups"" staying. And maybe it was going package. Breakfast much later in the morning and after a swim in the lovely pool was a far happier affair, most having gone through the dining room by then. So potentially a great place to stop with a lovely beach and beach bar, we left before lunch for a small boutique hotel in town and were not sorry.","April 2, 2017",0.0,0.0

We just looked entitled and walked through hotel to beach hut where there were changing rooms with showers,lavatories and sun loungers. A tip to attendant meant nice fluffy towels and a prime spot under the umbrella. The spot was beautiful. The s a as deliciously warm but not for faint hearted - huge, powerful, surf and a noticeable rip. There was a lifeguard but we had no idea of his swimming ability and he had no equipment to assist anyone in difficulties. I wouldn't let children swim in sea here. Around the other side of the hotel (and we think accessible by walking around from public beach) was a more sheltered place for swimming, protected by large rocks breaking the waves. There was a pool bar and restaurant on the beach. We ate lunch in the lounge - it was good and reasonably priced as we shared a pizza and single portion of chips ( portions were huge). We decided to try Sri Lankan trains for journey back to Colombo. It was very, very cheap. Train arrived on time (we googled) and we had seats. It was quicker than car taking about 25 minutes from Mount Lavinia to Colombo Fort. We saw so much that way. Trains weren't exactly comfortable but were ok.","March 1, 2017",0.0,0.0

You can go for a swim but get in where there are lifeguards and signs indicating that it is safe to bathe there. You get some nice restaurants and other hotels too, offering very nice foods of you choice. However, access to the beach is not that impressive. The government should do something about it. A good beach should have many good access points and most access points are not that impressive, including the access from College street side. You get good cabanas and that is a  living experience. The rocks in the sea has many attractions to young studying sciences, Salamanders, lichen, sea weeds, crabs, small beautiful fish trapped in the rock pockets during ebb, barnacles etc but be careful as they are bit slippery. The sand area washed by the waves have muscles and other shell animals. However, there are currents that you have to be aware of, else you will get drawn into the sea. When I was a teenager I got caught not being a good swimmer or having the required floating gear I just dived down and hugged the sands and crawled myself past the current, which looking up, I saw as a tube of twirling waters.
