As the literal name suggests it is said that this is the mountain where God Katharagama/ Skanda resided. There is a relatively steep climb to the top of the mountain. You have two options, you can either climb the stairs which are in relatively good order or take a ride in a lorry/ cab for LKR 600 one way... During corona we took the lorry both ways and the climb was a piece of cake.... last week we decided to climb.... it was ""perehera season"" which takes place for 2-3 weeks in July and was full of devotees. Plus the weather was extremely hot and humid. It took us 1.5 hours to climb. But I am pretty sure I climbed for half an hour and the balance part was spent on resting and eating snacks at various rest stops :) on our way back we opted for the lorry but had to wait in queue for 1 hour due to the crowds. Tickets to the top can be purchased from the entrance at the bottom of the mountain. I am not sure whether you can buy round trip tickets from there. Since we used the lorry only for the return trip, we bought the ticket from the top. Make sure to get a number assigned to your ticket as the queue forms based in such number. You don't have to stand in queue. They will call it out. One tip would be to buy the return ticket before you explore the top, specially if it's crowded. Also on the return journey try to get a seat right at the back of the lorry (and vice versa on the ascent).... otherwise you'll end up carrying a couple of hundred kilos worth of other passengers due to the steep climb/ descent;) At the top there is a kovil dedicated to God Skanda, another kovil dedicated to God Ishwara and a temple. Plus it has one of the most breathtaking views of Uva and Hambatlnthota provinces. On the last visit we had very clear skies and could even see waves breaking in the sea towards Yala side and even the Great Bases Lighthouse! It is said that King Dutugemunu, before going to war with Kind Elara made a promise to God Skanda that if he wins the war he will build a Kovil in the name of God Skanda. The story goes that once he won the war, God Skanda shot an arrow from Wedasiti Kanda and marked the place where the Kovil is to be built and there now stands the Ruhunu Maha Katharagama Devalaya. Once you climb to the top you can see the Katharagama Devalaya falling on a straight line from the summit of Wedasiti Kanda......","July 22, 2024",0.0,0.0

Much better hike as stairs constructed now, slow steady climb would take around 60-90min. Three temple in between the journey to bless the devotees.  Very peaceful with lush green surroundings, there is jeep available in case anyone planning to skip the stairs.","April 11, 2024",0.0,0.0

This is a quite long climb to top through the jungle with lots of monkeys. Now there are steps constructed, but earlier it was through trees using natural ropes. There is a nice historical story about this place (search and read). On the top of the mountain, there are two small temples, one is a Buddhists temple and the other is a Hindu kovil.","September 27, 2019",0.0,0.0

Lots of steps, try to allow an hour for a comfortable climb. Unfortunately the entire path, and the whole top of the temple are surrounded by piles of rubbish, it's such a shame that this place has been turned into a dumping ground for people who can't be bothered to take their litter home.","April 20, 2019",0.0,0.0
