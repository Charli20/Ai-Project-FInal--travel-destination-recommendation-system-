Built with blocks of coral and brick in the year 1560 by the Portuguese at the entry point of Mannar Island facing the lagoon, had been captured by the Dutch in 1658 and subsequently fallen to British in 1795. Structures within, had stood the test of time with most standing sturdy minus the rooves and the wooden components of doors and windows. It is well fortified with ramparts, moats, and once guarded entrance. Fort is square shaped and the visitor can walk on the rampart almost its full length seeing different views from different directions. From the ramparts there is a beautiful view of the vast span of lagoon that surrounds it. With the low tide boats that are moored in the vicinity gives the appearance that they have collapsed to a side and beached. The church building within the fort is a very interesting site with many ancient burial plaques still remaining in their original spots with beautiful carvings and inscriptions. Stairs leading to a pulpit is visible in the church. Ponds to collect fresh water and wells to supply the needs of the occupants of the Fort are still found with significant levels of water. Fort is one of the must-see places in Mannar.","April 5, 2020",0.0,0.0
