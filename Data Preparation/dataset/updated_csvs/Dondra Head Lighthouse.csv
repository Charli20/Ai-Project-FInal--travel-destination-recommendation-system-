It is located on the coast of the island, almost at the southernmost tip, in a settlement called Dondra. Some sources write that the lighthouse stands at the southernmost point of Sri Lanka. However, the geographer clarifies: in order to really be in the very, very south of the island, you need to walk 500 meters to the south - that’s where the very end of Ceylon will be, from where the vastness of the Indian Ocean will open to your eyes all the way to Antarctica!!! But let's return to the goal of our trip - the Dondra Head lighthouse. The latter, with its height of 49 meters, is the tallest lighthouse on the island, as well as one of the tallest lighthouses in Southeast Asia. The Dondra Head Lighthouse owes its appearance to the only British architect who received the title of knight and the title “sir” due to this status for his engineering and “lighthouse” merits - James Nicholas Douglas. The latter was a civil engineer and designer of lighthouses. During his life, Sir James designed at least two dozen famous and not so famous lighthouses in England, Wells, on the islands of Guernsey and Portland, as well as in Sri Lanka. The construction of the Dondra Head Lighthouse began in November 1887, and the construction was led by William Douglas from the Imperial Lighthouse Service (by the way, the brother of the sir mentioned above). Strange as it may sound, ALL the building materials that were used in the construction of this lighthouse were delivered from England!!! Two and a half years later, in March 1890, Dondra Head was put into operation. Like the Barberyn Island Lighthouse I visited earlier, this lighthouse is also one of the island's four international lighthouses. The seven-story faceted “body” of the Dondra Head lighthouse is cut through in places by window openings. Apparently the very “facetedness” of the structure made me think about the fortress donjon - the “tower of last hope”... Although, as I believe, this is so - for sailors caught in a night storm, the light of the lighthouse is the ray of that very “last hope”. hope""... Walking with my head up at the foot of the Dondra Head lighthouse, I involuntarily remembered the statement of Andrei Eigus from “Towers of Power”: “It seems to me that at the lighthouses themselves you experience something similar to what happens to you in the temple... Some kind of a secret place where there is no one and where you are alone with some magical power...” Alas, I was not able to climb to the top of this lighthouse - there are stricter rules... However, if fate does take you to the south of Sri Lanka, do not regret a little time - visit Dondra Head Lighthouse. Moreover, this is the only “knightly” lighthouse of the island!!!","March 18, 2024",0.0,0.0

Opening times were listed as from 0900 to 1900 hrs.  This 49m high lighthouse is the tallest Sri Lanka.  I was impressed by how impeccably the lighthouse and its premises are ""manicured"" and maintained by the current lighthouse operator – Sri Lanka Ports Authority.  The premises were very clean, neat and attractive giving a charming sense of tranquillity.  It is also located in a very picturesque location surrounded by the blue seas on three sides in the middle of coconut palms.  One of the persons guarding told me that it is still operational.  Though it is advertised as the southernmost point of Sri Lanka, the true southernmost point is ""Point Dondra"", 300 metres west and 300 metres south of the lighthouse.  Visitors were not permitted to enter the lighthouse tower. One of the 59 fundamental survey benchmarks in Sri Lanka is located within the premises and is protected and out of bounds to visitors.  A bolt on a concrete pillar going down to bedrock marks its position.  Blasting within 100 metres is prohibited for protection of its established reference values. A post-box located within the premises allows visitors to post a letter or a card originating from the southernmost point of Sri Lanka. After spending about an hour at this serene location, we visited the little cove and the bathing spot to the east of the lighthouse where there were many local fishing boats.

Prior to its destruction by the invading Portuguese the town boasted over 1000 statues and temples covered with brass, copper and gold. The pillars of the largest temple are spread over the town and can be found by those looking for them, just ask any local as we did and they will point you in the right direction. It does take some looking for though.  It cost Rs 500 just to walk up the tower. It is easy to see why this is the site of Sri Lanka's oldest lighthouse; it commands a majestic & strategic view of the Indian Ocean. Highly recommended for a fascinating visit, set among-st coconut palms & on the edge of huge waves crashing over a craggy outcrop. There is a beautiful view from lighthouse, nice nature around.   For those who wants to photograph, the inside has epic lightning. Though I have to admit the garden and tower was well taken care of. Once you've climbed the entire lighthouse you can see a big part of the island. Wonderful view! Recommended to do so.  It's so worth the climb as views are breathtaking, although you might not be so impressed if you're scared of heights. It's fascinating to see how basic the original lighthouse was; they still have spare panes of 19th century glass in case of breakages in particularly violent weather & the old communication system from top to bottom is hilarious. As this is the south end of Sri Lanka and you can have chance to go up there and see the south pole. It is so nice place and good chance to visit one of the oldest light houses on the earth. It is beautifully kept surroundings, interesting old workings, amazing views of the sea and land, good exercise after lying on Mirissa beach, eating fish, and we saw whales on the radar half way up. It was an easy climb to this the highest lighthouse in Sri Lanka. Definitely worth a visit as the view from top is magnificent. If you have residence visa you can negotiate for a better deal. There are 220 steps each way, my wife counted. You get amazing  360 degree views from the top make the climb worthwhile.

About 1km further south is the splendid Dondra Head Lighthouse, the most southerly point of the country. The lighthouse is land based so that you can touch it, photograph it, walk round it and, if you can obtain the necessary permission, climb the 196 stairs to the top where there is a fine viewing platform. But I understand that permission currently is not granted. It is British by design and construction. Designed by Sir James Nicholas Douglass and built by William Douglass of the British Imperial Lighthouse Service, all the building materials, bricks, steel, granite rock and the Hyper radiant lenses came from Britain. It was first commissioned in 1890. At 49m high it is the tallest lighthouse in Sri Lanka and one of the four international lighthouses in the country. In the year 2000 it was upgraded to include a Global Positioning System and was computer linked to other major lighthouses in the country. It is a very elegant and photogenic structure, octagonal in shape, painted brilliant white and complimented by some coconut palms in a little park. On the site there is a little ice cream stall and parking is adjacent, although very difficult for coaches to manoeuver when turning round. Dondra Head Lighthouse is a great place just to sit for a while, relax and watch the sea crashing against the rocks below. Also, as you look out to sea, you should realise that  the next land mass is noy until you reach Antarctica. Unless you have hired a tuk tuk, locating the lighthouse may depend on asking the locals, for it is poorly signposted from Dondra town.","March 30, 2018",0.0,0.0

You can go up to the top of the light and walk around outside for great views of the seas.  Some other reviewers mention in passing that it's neat the southernmost point in Sri Lanka.  However, all the other reviews on TA don't mention the #1 reason I went to see it,  So to speak, they may have missed the point. Just as arbitrary lines on maps mark the borders of countries, other lines on charts mark the arbitrary boundaries of seas.  The southernmost point of Dondra marks exactly where major seas come together.  The ocean rolls on heedless of the boundaries, just as the Alps themselves don't care whether we call them Swiss, French or Italian; but the borders are quite official.  The IHO, the International Hydrographic Organization, agrees on the lines, and they agreed the three major bodies of water meet at a single point, ""the Southern extreme of Dondra Point.  If stand at this point and look due south, you're looking at the Indian Ocean.  But from the same point headed west, you see the Laccadive Sea.  And from the same point an imaginary line running East by South marks the Southern boundary of the Bay of Bengal. Technically you can jump into the Bay of Bengal, swim across the Indian Ocean all the way to the Laccadive Sea and swim back again in under five minutes.  Better be a good swimmer though, depending on the conditions.  Today there were heavy waves coming in from the west, and quite a strong current running from west to east; it was like swimming in a river.  Rip tides are a real danger in Sri Lanka; if in doubt, better to err on the side of caution. Naturally, all three bodies of water can be seen from the top of the lighthouse.  I will try to attach two pix.  The first was taken looking NW; the water in the foreground is officially the Bay of Bengal, while the water on the far side of the point is the Laccadive Sea.  The second pic shows the point itself, where all three meet.","May 22, 2014",0.0,0.0
