The statue has nore than 2500 years of history and and this stone statue is located close to Parakrama Samudraya (meaning like sea made from joining 3 large tanks) and this location is known as the Pothgul Vehera.(A library) .It is a great creation of Sri Lankan  history. This is an excellent place for a visit. The history of this place never ends and has a lot to obtain. Even though it is named as the statue of the  King Parakramabahu there are a lot of different stories as to who actually the statute represents. Some says it is King Parakramabahu the Great some others others say that is of Agastaya from another sage from a different era. Archeological Departmernt says that this statue is not the king & it is sage Pulasthi's statue. because the object held in the hand represent a palm-leaf manuscript of a sage. But it is widely believed that this is the statue (carved out of Rock) of an ancient great King Parakramabahu. The king believed to be the one of the greatest in Sri Lankan history during which period it was self-sufficient in food due to agricultural and prosperity in all other sectors concerned. The vast lake, Parakrama Samudraya in front of the statue has been built by this king to retain the water for agriculture and other uses. The area got dry for 9 months of the year and it’s a remarkable planning of storage of water to supply for cultivations throughout the year. There is a school of thought that this statue of King Parakramabahu is of a great scholar at that time. There is a beautiful wildness on the outskirts of the forest and it is easy to get to along the bund of the Parakrama Samudraya.  It has easy parking across  where elephants are often seen. It is better to visit as early to avoid sun heat. Photos taken posing back to the statue of the King is prohibited and there are security to enforce it. This statue looks at Potgul Vehera (Library) and there is a chronicles saying that this library was built by King Parakramabahu, to protect his knowledge to future. Therefore he looks at the library built by him where his knowledge is contained. But some of folk traditions saying greater king Parakramabahu didn't make his own statues. This statue looks big at the guide books, but up close, it's both huge and amazingly and well preserved. When you hire a guide from near the museum, sometimes they  avoid this statue to save some time. Don't miss it.","November 11, 2017",0.0,0.0
