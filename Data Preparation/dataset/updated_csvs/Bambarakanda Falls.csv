From there a 5km hike to the waterfall. The road itself is a picturesque one, with wonderful scenery all around. Never forget your camera if you are a nature enthusiasts.  You will find few small villages on your way to top. Mind it its very narrow road but still you can drive a van/suv/mpv. When you reach the summit from the you have to walk around 2km to the waterfall. Newly built steps will help you to ease yourself. On the way 2 clean public toilets are available.

The journey to the bottom of the fall is through a narrow and difficult climb.It is a motorable road but at the top you have to walk a few meters to reach the water fall. The view of the fall is fantastic but recommend only for those appreciating scenic beauty. From Colombo you go through Ratnapura and take the Balangoda road. Balangoda has a beautiful Rest House where you can have a good Rice and Curry meal. From Balangoda you drive up to Haputale through Beragala. From Beragala you can see all the way to Uda Walawe and Kirinda in deep south on a clear day. The road to Bambarakanda is between Beragala and Haputale. If you want to see Bambarakanda falls I suggest you stay over at Haputale for the night. There are enough vacation rentals and a new hotel to stay in Haputale. From Haputale you can go down to Bandarawela another Holiday town. While in Haputale you should visit Adisham Bungalow a former residence of a scottish gentlemen now run by the catholic priests.The scenic drive from Balangoda to Bandarawela is worth doing when holidaying in Sri Lanka. My last visit was around August 2012. I rate the Bambarakanda Waterfall visit average because of the roadway leading to falls but the waterfall is worth seing.,"June 17, 2014",0.0,0.0

If you enjoy long walks then it would be a nice walk from the main road, good scenery and a small village, about 5km all along narrow paved road with almost no traffic. There is no entrance fee and almost no tourists, we only passed a group of local uni students on their way out. And there is a couple of nice seats to sit and admire the falls for a while.
