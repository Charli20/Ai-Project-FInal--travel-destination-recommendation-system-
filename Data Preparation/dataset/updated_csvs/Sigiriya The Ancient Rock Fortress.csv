Everything was well organized and smooth. The tour included Sigiriya Rock, a Habarana village tour, and Pidurangala Rock. Our guide was very kind, patient, and helpful, especially with our family. He explained things simply and made sure everyone was comfortable. The village tour was a lovely experience and showed us local life and traditions. The view from Pidurangala was amazing and a perfect end to the day. We felt safe and well looked after the whole time. We highly recommend Hai Sri Lanka for families visiting Sri Lanka.

I think it’s one of those trips you probably just have to do if you visit Sri Lanka, swallow the cost and do it. The folks who climb the opposite hill do not see the ruins at all but it depends on budget for sure. What made me cross was the dire state of the toilets, no loo roll in the cubicle but offered loo roll to dry my hands! The museum was pretty interesting but the building seriously needs painting.

Numerous caves in the vicinity still feature remnants of inscriptions from that ancient era. The site's purpose shifted dramatically around the 5th century AD when King Kashyapa I seized the throne. Fearing retaliation from his half-brother, he moved his capital here, transforming the monastic site into a sophisticated urban complex and an imposing, defensive fortress with a palace atop the rock. The ascent to the summit can be divided into four main segments. The first three are characterized by gentle inclines through the elaborate water and boulder gardens at the base. The final segment of the climb, however, is a challenging journey up a modern steel staircase attached to the sheer rock face, comprising around 1,200 steps. For those with a fear of heights, it's best to avoid looking down. Today, only the massive, intricately carved lion's paws remain at the base of this final staircase; the head, body, and shoulders of the colossal brick-and-plaster lion gateway have long since collapsed and disappeared over time. The initial ascent and descent share the same path for the first half of the journey. At the very top, while there are no standing structures, you can explore the preserved ancient foundations of the royal palace. You will be amply rewarded with bountiful, panoramic vistas of the surrounding jungle and landscape. A separate, one-way descent leads you past a spiral staircase that shouldn't be missed, as it provides access to a sheltered cave with beautifully preserved, vibrant wall paintings of celestial maidens, known as the Sigiriya Damsels. There was a guard in there to ensure no photos are taken.","November 3, 2025",0.0,0.0

Coming to the island and not seeing Sigiriya is like doing without Paris in France. Taking advantage of this, the authorities set the price of tickets beyond world standards. 35 USD. For a family of three, that's a sensitive $105. I always compare it to the Louvre. There's a 22 euro ticket. Plus, at the Louvre, shoot wherever you want, but here you can only look at the maidens of Sigiriya. With your eyes, not your smartphone lens... But tourists are obviously not deterred. Tourists come from all over the island. We didn't get long-- from Dambulla. Sigiriya is a giant 183-metre-long stationary rock in the middle of the jungle. The name means ""Lion Rock"" in Sinhala. The truth is that only two paws remain of the giant lion that once existed. The paws, though, still have to be reached. From the parking lot and entrance, the path to the cliff runs through the water gardens. In the time of the murderous king Cassapus, who made Sigiriya his capital, there were fountains that were supplied with water from the tanks on top of the rock. By hand slaves. Then comes the terrace park. Here in the time of Cassapus in the fifth century stood houses whose foundations were huge stones, past which you walk on your way to the summit. Legs. These aren't Chinese Huangshan or Zhangjiajie with their funiculars and elevators. Only feet up the stairs here. Halfway to the summit, the dilemma is whether to go up or to the right. At the top of the mountain, to the right are the famous frescoes of Sigiriya. On your way up, you'll see the famous lion's legs found by English archaeologists under Bell in 1898. On the last section, the stairs are quite steep, though generally safe. Unfortunately, only the foundations remain of the Kassap Palace and the rest of the structures. And tanks. The reward for climbing up will be views of the surrounding jungle. To see the frescoes of Sigiriya now, you have to go downstairs and follow the stairs that follow the wall to the right. You'll have to wait in line on the stairs, because the cave, which is closed to the sun, doesn't hold too many people. Few of the murals remain: out of about 500, only 19 images of women remain. But what! They represent the ancient Indian ideal of beauty: proper facial oval, almond-shaped eyes, eagle nose, full lips, lush breasts, thin waist. Scientists can't agree whether it's the king's wives or the Ansar maidens in heaven. It is believed that since the 1930s the frescoes have dimmed, so it is not possible to photograph.

Visiting Sigiriya Rock Fortress was absolutely breathtaking. The climb up the rock was thrilling, and the views from the top are nothing short of spectacular rolling hills, lush greenery, and the vast landscape of Sri Lanka stretching out in every direction. The ancient frescoes, water gardens, and the well-preserved ruins of this UNESCO World Heritage Site are fascinating. Our guide provided insightful stories about the history, culture, and legends of Sigiriya, which made the visit even more meaningful.

The hill top fortress is very well preserved with the ancient brick wall of the seven story wooden palace of King Kasyapa still in good condition.

Difficult to climb the steep steel steps, the view from the top with jungle all around is amazing. The entry fee for the monument @35 USD for foreigners is quite steep. After climbing almost 1000 steps on the steel ladder which needs urgent repairs and a fresh coat of weather proof paint, the hill top is exposed to strong winds. It is suggested that strong guard rails could be provided at the hill top for the safety of the visitors. It is also suggested that a chair lift / cable car could be constructed for the visitors. It is also suggested that separate entry / exit stair case/routes could  be constructed for the convenience of the visitors  to avoid the long traffic snarls at the lions paws entrance area. It is also suggested that the authorities could provide a direct descend stair case to the cave paintings instead of compelling the weary visitor to climb another 200 steps by a spiral staircase to reach the fresco cave.

I am not particularly fit but decided to go along on a hot day with lots of people queueing on the first level around the square to reach the lion’s paws! It’s such a site not to be missed ! All brochures have this image of the rock and I must say that it was a pretty unique experience ! Only one way in and one way down . The spiralling staircase in the middle platform is to access the paintings - it’s a quick optional  trip on your way down. On the way up , do as you please at your own pace . It was fairly busy with hordes of young school children but be more aware of groups of young male teenagers and let them overtake you ! Best to climb slowly behind a mum or dad carrying their child ! I suffered from vertigo but determined to climb slowly up and go down . The crowd helps the pace and there are some waiting times if people overtake due to bottleneck at the top both ways . Your patience will be rewarded! Take some water with you and a small snack to enjoy the view from the top ! The dogs at the top did not like bread … but loved the breakfast omelette I had as a take out ! Bananas are the best to re- energise . Be aware of monkeys , they are not many up there but can swing suddenly off the trees on the way up and cause panic ! It’s not a place you visit like a marathon so half a day - 3  hours is good / depends on the waiting time up on level 1. Majestic place and it can be quite windy in the edge . We did the other pic across after a brief cup of tea and ice cream in town. Toilet facilities were clean with papers at the ticket entrance ( ticket purchase in the building) and later in the car park . It’s free but there will always an attendant trying to ask for 100 SLR - for maintening the toilet cleaned , I think it’s worth a little tip !

When we got to the top we found a peaceful place to sit to watch the sunrise. This was spoilt by a very rude European man and his friend who was climbing all over the ruins getting ready to fly his drone to ‘film content’ 🙄 People began yelling at him as there was clear signage around not flying drones on the rock. This destroyed the peace and quiet until he flew his drone and then moved on, why do the rules not apply to everyone?! All in all we really enjoyed this walk and can recommend to others. We then went straight over and climbed Pidurangala Rock to see the view from this side also.

I leave you with two different ideas: 1) if you climb the mountain at seven in the morning, when there is no queue, climb quickly (it does not take who knows what physical prowess) you have less time to think and you manage the time of the climb. 2) if you go up in the morning c and a lot of queue, so the positive side 3 that you see a lot of people of all ages and shapes climbing and this cheers you up, the negative side is that you climb the stairs slowly and this can make the route more complicated.

TA also has a separate property called Lion Rock, which refers to the same thing. After all, it was hot to climb in the daytime, so we set out for dawn. It was around 6am at sunrise and I thought I would start climbing when the museum opened at 5am, but my resident driver told me it was still dark and dangerous, so I bought a ticket at 5:45am at the foot of the mountain at the museum. Foreigners will be charged ridiculously high 35USD. Credit cards accepted. There are already a lot of people at this point, but it's not uncomfortable. It was cloudy, so I didn't know dawn anyway, so I was happy enough. It may feel better not to be with people who start running as soon as the museum opens. If you really wanted to have a dawn at the top, you should have provided headlights. Rumor has it that there is a copy of Sigillian Lady on the second floor of the museum, but no one is going to see it because I am anxious to climb it quickly, including myself. There is no option to see it on the way home, as it is a different route. There were reproductions in the Colombo museum, but the real one is much more beautiful. I didn't know when it would be restored, but it was pretty clear and unexpected. Some of the lines were double, and you could see the marks of restoration, but I didn't really know that much. The content is the highlight of Sri Lanka as you have written, and just because it is expensive, it costs only 5000 yen, so don't choose to climb only the cheap Pidungala. Mt. Fuji is another example of consideration where it is OK to charge about 10,000 yen from foreigners. On the way back, there is a souvenir shop where you can try out puzzle-style yosegi crafts and other products. It's like Hakone-zaiku karakuribako.

It is one of the country’s most iconic landmarks and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Here are some key facts about Sigiriya: Historical significance: Built by King Kashyapa I (477–495 CE) as his royal residence and fortress after he seized the throne. After Kashyapa's death, Sigiriya served as a Buddhist monastery until about the 14th century. Architecture: Sigiriya is admired for its sophisticated urban planning, water gardens, frescoes (beautiful ancient paintings), the famous ""Mirror Wall"" (a highly polished wall with ancient inscriptions and graffiti), and the impressive ""Lion Gate"" at the entrance to the final climb to the summit. The rock: The rock itself is nearly 200 meters (660 feet) high and offers spectacular views from the top. The climb involves navigating a series of steep staircases and pathways. Cultural importance: Sigiriya is considered a marvel of ancient engineering and creativity, and it plays an important role in Sri Lankan history and cultural identity. Would","April 29, 2025",0.0,0.0

Note the access to the start of the rock climb is a longish walk from the entrance / ticket office so allow time for that in planning. Then I was reluctant to take a guide - but once one had clung on to me I was glad i did, partly for information but largely being no longer young it was good to have a helping hand up some of the eroded stone steps on the long route up and down and best to fix the fee before starting.

Very bad experience wasted by the world and by infrastructure not planned for so many people safely.

Very little security at all levels to ensure the ascent and descent serenely, no personnel to help in case of trouble (on the other hand, be careful, men jump on you to help you climb the first steps all the way down and ask you for money because they helped you, even if you did not ask for anything) This is all the more dangerous because we had to go downhill in the rain, making the metal steps or the rock-cut steps slippery, falls occurred just behind us.

I am glad I took their advice. The guidebooks would make you think it was a fairly easy stroll but it is not. It is a climb which should be taken seriously and prepared for. I am fit but even I found it hard work, especially the almost vertical parts! The best part was that I had a guide and he gave me an excellent history of everything from the pools and gardens at the bottom to the rock itself and the fortress on top. He also helped me when some of the climb was a bit hairy! I think the first part up to the Lions Paw Terrace, is the worst. Then, you have the chance to catch your breath and stare vertically upwards at the rest of the rock - and at the lion's paws. It's a great place to take a proper break, drink water - or better still - water mixed with Hydrolite or similar, eat Gummi Bears and reflect on the amazing feat of architecture. It's also a place where you can change your mind and go down if you can't go any further. Going between the paws you realise just how big the lion must have been and then ... it's up, up, up. There are parts where it's almost vertical and I was glad of the queue as it gave me a) time to look at the views and b) take it slowly. When you reach the top the views are simply breathtaking. You can wander all over - there are very few limitations. There was also a light breeze which was very welcome after the climb. Going down has its own hazards but again - take your time. The wall freezes are now covered and you have to go up metal stairs. No photographs as there are few left, thanks to vandalism. Worst aspect? Negotiating your way through the souvenir hustlers, but be firm and keep walking.

One is go in the early morning -- like 5am.  You may want to use a guide to be able to find your way in the dark (definitely bring a flashlight) and to get some basic history.  Guides can be hired at the gate, I don't think you can take external guides. We originally went for sundown, and it was miserably croweded---and I also cannot imagine being at the top and then being in the dark once you lose the sun.  Not only that, but there are signs all along the trail to the top saying ""be aware of wasps"" which evidently if agitated by noise (or they just aren't having a great day) they will swarm and sting people.  This was alarming enough along with being in a big crowd which if panicked could be very dangerous for us to go early morning.","January 6, 2025",0.0,0.0

The ticket costs $35 per person, and while tour guides are available for around SLR 5000 (though you might hear higher quotes), we opted to explore on our own. Thanks to the wealth of well-written online articles and historical guides, it was easy to understand the site's rich history without needing a guide, who we were told by other visitors would rush us at all times (they only give you 2 hrs to climb up & come down, so limited stops enjoying the views). For the best experience, plan your climb during sunrise or about an hour before sunset. The early or late hours allow you to avoid the scorching midday sun and enjoy spectacular views. The climb itself is around 30 minutes to the top, but we took longer on the descent, pausing to capture photos and watch playful monkeys along the way. The journey from the ticket counter to the rock is equally enchanting. The path winds through lush greenery, serene lily ponds, and ancient ruins. If you choose a sunrise visit, you can always take your time to enjoy these sights on your way back down. A couple of practical tips: there are no bathroom facilities on the way up, so plan accordingly. Bathrooms are only available near the ticket area. The climb involves 1,200–1,500 steps, so prepare for a bit of a workout. Whether for the history, the views, or the sense of achievement, Sigiriya Rock is a must-visit. It’s an experience you’ll cherish long after your journey ends.","November 27, 2024",0.0,0.0

Make sure you have transport into the ticket area if early as there may still be wild elephants on the roads Ticket office and toilets are together US $35 entrance fee is a bit steep but its a one off .

The hornet safety area is also located there Hornets nest in the rocks and once disturbed can be aggressive The final push will deliver you to the top monkeys can be a pest on the final stretch do not take fruit with you as they target those they think have food and definitely do not feed them.

The fortress is famous for its well-preserved frescoes, the Lion’s Gate, and the Mirror Wall, which is covered in ancient inscriptions. Visitors must climb a series of steps to reach the summit, where the remnants of the royal palace and its surroundings can be explored.

I had some basic knowledge of the rock's history from before but you can get a pamphlet from the ticket counter too. Some tips: try to go as early as possible, right around sunrise if possible.

When arriving to the site we were taken to the museum first which helped us to understand the history of the area which far surpassed the fortress being built. Leaving the museum you will make your way through the gate and over the bridge to set off through the water gardens before the first of 1200 steps, which are not the easiest to climb, our guide explained how dyes were made in ancient times and gave us an abundance of additional information however try not to be helped by ""lucky lucky"" guides as they will expect paying for even offering a hand. The stairs are mostly uneven and narrow, and much like the driving conditions in Sri Lanka, if there is a space in front of you people will push past you to get into it. Timing is everything on the climb and would not attempt this in blistering heat. Some of the stairs are metal which could provide some reassurance through the climb  but the height and positioning of  these may leave those with an aversion to heights feeling uneasy, as you get to the first plateau (before the Lions feet) look left to see an ancient defence weapon. The views from the top are worth all the effort of the climb, you will be left breathless ensure you look back down towards the water gardens, you will also see stray dogs have also chosen to make the climb just to admire the views. Although only the foundations of the fortress map the buildings of the fortress it is easy to visualise how grand the fortress will have been.

The entry fee for foreigners is $35 for adults and $20 for kids, which feels a bit steep, but it’s a UNESCO World Heritage site, so I’ll take it. Pro tip: Bring water, a hat, and comfy shoes. And don’t forget that sunscreen—it’s a must in the heat! ☀️ On your way to the rock, you’ll see wild monkeys. They’re super cool—some have black faces, others are pink—but remember, don’t touch or feed them. They bite! Just snap a pic from a distance. 📸🐒 There’s also a museum you can visit, located in a pretty dilapidated building where you buy the tickets. It houses a replica of the paintings from Sigiriya Rock, but for the high fees they charge, I think they should at least renovate and modernize the space. My guide shared some amazing stories about the ruins. I couldn’t help but think how cool it would be to see a 3D model of what this place looked like back then. The ruins start as soon as you cross the moat, not just at the top! It gets crowded, so go early. You’ll avoid the rush and the scorching noon sun. It’s a total win-win. 🌅 And about those comfy shoes… you’re going to need them! There are over 1,200 steps to reach the top, so get ready for a leg workout. 🏋️‍♀️ Along the way, you’ll find other cool sights. There’s a cave shaped like a king cobra, boulders forming an archway, and ancient pools. It’s pretty amazing to see. At the top, it’s mostly ruins, but the views make it totally worth it. Plus, the wind up there is a nice break from the heat. It kind of makes you think about the people who built it—reminds me of Machu Picchu! 🏞️ Don’t miss the cave paintings of the women—they’re stunning.

Mugalan, the elder brother flees to India. Kashyapa is shunned by the clergy and the people of Anuradhapura, the capital city at the time. Due to this and also in fear of an invasion by his brother, he flees to Sigiriya rock, builds a fortress atop the rock and rules from there. Eighteen years later, Mugalan returns with an army and Kashyapa (for some unexplained reason, decides to meet his brother outside the very fortress which he supposedly built to withstand an invasion) and dies in battle.... Sigiriya is abandoned and the capital city shifts back to Anuradhapura. But when you see this 5th century architectural marvel you would be left doubting the truth of this story. Because Sigirya is so much more than a fortress built for protection. While it has the usual walls and moats it is very evident that it has been built with an eye for ""all things beautiful"".... Nowadays you enter Sigiriya from its Western entrance. No excavations have been done on the eastern side yet. As you enter you walk through a symmetrical water garden. Even here, full excavations have been done only on one side. But you can still see ponds of various shapes and sizes and even fountains that function to this day. Once you pass the water garden, you go through the ""Boulder garden"" where the pathway to top and various ancillary buildings have been constructed using the natural placement of the boulders. Then you get to the Terrace Garden where you see the famous lion paws. The entrance to the top of the rock lies between the paws. Once you get to the top there are ruins of the palace, ponds and panoramic views. On your way back, you will take a different route and pass through the ""Mirror Wall"" a 5th century construction, on which 8th - 12th century visitors to Sigiriya have written 100s of poems about the beauty they have witnessed.....  and unlike the scrawls of visitors these days, these poems are considered as having high literary value... Next you come to what is probably Sigiriya is most famous for... it's cave paintings. According to archeologists and also the poems on the mirror wall, at one point, the entire western facade of the rock was likely covered in the same paintings.... there are various interpretations of who the ladies in the paintings are, some say they are ladies of Kashyapa's harem, some say they are noble ladies and some say they are angles from the sky.... Tips for visiting: -Sigiriya deserves its palce as the eighth wonder of the world, but reading up on it before before visiting will greatly enhance your experience as neither the sad looking museum nor the guides will do justice King Kashyapa's visionary work. -There is an entrance fee. A reasonable amount for locals. Not sure about the fee for foreigners. -You take two different path ways to go up and down, hence its advisable to check out all the places on the way up to avoid missing them on the way down. -This is a relatively easy climb. Took us about 45 mts to climb with all the detours and 20 mts to climb down. Plus it's not a religious place, so you can wear anything suitable for the weather/ hiking. -Anything amazing will loose its luster if you are sweating buckets ;) so early morning or evening would be a better idea, subject to opening and closing hours. -There are wild elephants on the access roads to Sigiriya specially at night and in the early mornings. So, if you are climbing Sigiriya to see the sunrise, do take the advice of a guide. -There have always been wasps nests near the lion paws, I remember seeing them even when I was a kid. There have been a couple of rare instances in which attacks have occurred, most recent being this August. This usually happens when the crowd gets too nosiy. Here, the tip would be to climb on a less crowded day, which would also help in avoiding queues.","September 2, 2024",0.0,0.0

What we read about Sigiriya was about its breathtaking view. We had probably not read the fine print of the dangerous, thrilling adventure it had in store. Our guide who was used to getting passengers  from one air conditioned hotel to the other was amused at the idea that we were game to climbing arduous heights. So we asked to take us to sigiriya rock on the evening we reached there. Having read the Instagram post I was all ready for the phased climb. We began our ascent at about 5pm with the sky already turning grey. So it was a reminder of the scenes from the movie Manjummel boys ( malayalam original). Narrow pathways between boulders and steep staircases which completely disappeared as u ascended, one could not really figure out how high u were going because of the trees. There were climbers from various parts of the world mostly fit men and women and all we knew was we weren’t giving up yet. Ascending higher we met people who were coming down who just told us to keep going. No one really gave out details. About 25 mins, we we neared the Buddha statue. A few mins of rest and we ascended. The next part was a bit harder with just bare rock and narrow crevices and a wrong move that could send u toppling down into the forest below.. yet no one seemed very worried. There are no guides and everything seemed wrong from what I read. Only when we reached the top did we realise we had climbed the more arduous pidurangala rock and that we were viewing the more spectacular sigiriya mountain just across the landscape. From here u could actually see the staircase on the sigiriya mountain!! Having successfully reached the top we made our way carefully down with the resolve to conquer sigiriya the next morning. The rainy season had begun and we prayed the rains would hold on for a few hours the next day just like it did that evening. Sigiriya is a guided tour and not so dangerous/tiring. What tests your nerves is the steep metal staircase which can turn your legs to jelly if u try to look down. The schoolchildren aged lesser than 10 years climbing up with us with zero fear made us not want to quit. We preserved and reached the top in about 40 mins with a break at the lions paws. The view from the top is beautiful but I guess it feels much more beautiful because you have conquered your own fears and feel like an Olympian ! The way down the metal staircase is not easy and then down the narrow and sandy cemented steps . The walk to the see the frescoes ( atop a spiral staircase) can still feel ethereal. It’s definitely a once in a lifetime experience- all u need is some guts , prayers and a bottle of water .","August 12, 2024",0.0,0.0

Sigiriya, or Lion Rock, is not just a historical site—it's a journey back in time. The moment you start climbing, you’re stepping into a world where ancient engineering meets breathtaking natural beauty. The ascent to the summit is both exhilarating and rewarding. The Lion’s Gate, with its impressive lion paws, is a powerful symbol of the fortress’s former grandeur. The Mirror Wall, once polished to reflect the king’s image, now tells stories through ancient inscriptions and poems left by past visitors. And let’s not forget the stunning frescoes that still dazzle with their vibrant colors and artistic detail. The panoramic views from the top are simply unparalleled. From up there, you can see the lush Sri Lankan countryside stretch out in every direction, providing a stunning backdrop to the ruins of the ancient palace. It’s a moment that truly takes your breath away. What I love most about guiding tours at Sigiriya is the opportunity to share the rich history and legends with visitors. Every corner of the site has its own story, and seeing the wonder and excitement in my guests’ eyes as they learn about this incredible place is always a highlight. For anyone looking to immerse themselves in Sri Lanka’s heritage and experience one of its most iconic landmarks, Sigiriya is an absolute must. Whether you're a history enthusiast or simply a traveler seeking stunning views, this site offers something special for everyone.","August 10, 2024",0.0,0.0

The view from below is amazing and pairs with the pictures from above. The climb is tiring due to the heat but in itself it is short (about 20 minutes) on comfortable metal stairs (stone stairs are more uncomfortable, the first ones you meet. The two mighty stone lion legs really make you imagine how amazing the palace must have been and the frescoes, although limited, are very beautiful and sensual. In addition, the view, from the top, sweeps over endless carpets of trees, interrupted by lakes and streams and low mountains. The museum is also interesting. But Sigirya deserves the highest rating both for the incredibly exaggerated price ($36 each without discounts for families or students or anything else) and because at such a price you would definitely expect a much better service (for example the included guide or a very modern museum). I am sorry to write this but after the 30 Dollars of Pollonaruwa and the 36 Dollars of Sigyria, we decided to continue our journey carefully avoiding all the plucking places of Sri Lanka.","August 4, 2024",0.0,0.0

There is really nothing else in the area worth seeing for such an expensive entrance fee. We ended up not going upstairs and we tried to get a ticket refund. No staff was able or willing to help. We tried calling to the manager, who said to me directly in my ear “f#ck you!” When I tried politely explain why I wanted back my money. Only after turning to the police and our local tour guide the manager apologized and offered us to come back the next day. But to be honest, the impression was already so soiled, not counting in the 3 hour ride one was for us, that we said we didn’t want to come back the next day.

Say no to all the guides that nag you on the way in and I would recommend you walk and say no to the guy offering an elevator ride down in a steel cage.","June 10, 2024",0.0,0.0

My engineering boyfriend was looking at it, and was talking something about stainless steel, reinforced bolts, redundancy, etc. I wasn't paying attention to him, I just concentrated at staring at his feet (going up) or back (going down). I also did the iron staircase with mirror wall, which felt really secure, very strong iron and it's also wrapped in metal cage. Nothing like past pictures. It's great at the top and worth it.  If you have a partner who understands and can help you with your fears, you can do it. I just did not stare out, i always stared towards the mountain and had my partner in front of me to set the pace. We went early (arrived at 7:30 am) and shoulder season when there is less people so you can grab rails with both your hands. We also got tons of pictures with no people in it.

As I climbed the ancient staircases and marvelled at the stunning frescoes and expansive views, I couldn't help but feel a sense of wonder at the ingenuity of the ancient builders who constructed this architectural marvel. After descending from Sigiriya, I embarked on a village tour led by a friendly and insightful guide Lochana. Venturing off the beaten path, we explored lush paddy fields, vibrant fruit orchards, and quaint rural settlements, immersing ourselves in the rhythm of daily village life. Along the way, the guide shared fascinating anecdotes and historical insights, offering a deeper understanding of Sri Lanka's rich cultural heritage. The highlight of the village tour was undoubtedly the warm hospitality of the local villagers, who welcomed us with open arms and genuine smiles. From sampling delicious home-cooked meals to trying my hand at traditional crafts, every interaction was a heartwarming reminder of the warmth and generosity of the Sri Lankan people. The entrance fee for Sigiriya was 30 USD per adult and half price for kids. Additionally, the village tour was priced at 15 USD per person.

With several people it is cost-effective and you absolutely do NOT want to try and rent a car and drive yourself unless you have a lot of previous experience with this type of traffic.  Anyway…Sigirya is another must do excursion. There is quite a climb to the top, up rock and cement steps and up metal steps attached to the cliff face. If heights bother you, be aware. Hiring a guide is not expensive $12-15, and you will get lots of information. Or you can read up ahead of time and get the same info. Very interesting history of parricide, sibling rivalry, family feuds, and a playboy king who lived up top with his one wife and 500 concubines. Amazing use of water for heating and cooling, with conduits and pools and sanitary systems.  Great views.  Fascinating history. It reminded me a little of Egyptian ruins, and the magnificence that has been eroded by time and weather.","February 15, 2024",0.0,0.0

Despite our age we managed to get to the top but the round trip up an down took a few hours with lots of stops along the way. There are many interesting sights on your stops so a good excuse to catch your breath. Plenty of Guides / Assistants will offer to take you to the top. A fair price is US$20. Beware that assistants will start helping you on the steps and despite us repeatedly saying ""No"" three of them continued all the way to the top and back telling us they were locals and only want to help to make us happy. At the end they asked for US$75 but after reminding them we did not agree and were constantly saying no, we paid them something because they did help my wife on some of the steeper sections. Anyone younger and fitter can do this climb without the use of a guide / assistant. If you need the help on the 1200 steps up and 1200 steps down then I would advice to engage a strong assistant as they will take your arm or push you up the steep parts. There are plenty of signs in multiple languages explaining everything you are looking at. Despite the warning signs about being quiet so as not to disturb the hornets there was many people making lots of noise. There is a treatment tent half way up is someone gets stung but never saw anyone bitten so I think as long as you do the correct thing all will be okay. Also seal you bags and keep food hidden as the monkeys will steal things as they are after food.

People say that Sigiriya is a must-visit place, and it's the number one attraction in Sri Lanka. However, I'm not sure if that's the case. Yes, the view from the top is beautiful, but that's all you get. Tickets for locals cost 100 rupees (0.25p), while for foreigners, it's 9000 rupees (£25.00). I understand that there should be some price variation between foreigners and locals, but charging foreigners 90 times more than locals is outrageous. Additionally, the climb to the top is dangerous, with no staff present in case of an emergency. You wouldn't know who to contact. Overall, I wouldn't recommend visiting this place. If you're passing through Sigiriya, you can take some beautiful pictures at the entrance without paying the exorbitant admission fees. However, if you do decide to go and climb the rock, take plenty of water bottles with you, as there are no shops once you pass the admission entrance.

It is 1200 steps climb to the top of the rock fortress. We started earlier in the day as in July it can get very hot and humid during the latter part of the day. You do not need a great fitness level to be able to climb it. Anyone can climb it. If you are not used to climbing then you can take breaks at different intervals of the climb, where you have sitting areas and view points, when you take the breaks. I think it took me about 45 minutes to do the climb with the photographs in between and I am not in any great shape. Even if you have a fear of heights, it is not at all difficult to do the climb. Though looking at the steps clinging to the rock may seem challenging, it really is not, once you start climbing it. To see the frescos, you need to walk a very small path hugging the rock, which again looks like a vertigo inducing one, but once you walk, it is easily doable. The spiral staircase to the frescos also has barriers on all sides, so just take it step by step and you will be fine. Just make sure that you have water with you and a hat or a cap against the sun. You can do the climb to the top and back in less than 3 hours but it is nice to take the time to do the climb and stop at each section of the climb, which has interesting things while going up and down ( different paths if you go to the frescos ). You can easily spend an hour at the top, admiring the sweeping views and taking loads of pictures and giving your legs a rest for the climb down. You do not need a guide to take you to the top. Going up or down or to the frescos is pretty straight forward and you will not be rushed if you do it on your own.","July 27, 2023",0.0,0.0

The museum part at the start is a bit rubbish of the old photos but it was nice to see the jewellery and things uncovered from the site. The walk along the flat to the rock just brings home the scale of the place its just incredible. The climb up is all even steps and in different sections, the first part is steady wide stone steps with places to stop on the way. Once at the top of that you can see the stone lions feet as the entrance of the fortress itself. There are some dogs/ monkeys about so be careful of having food and drink out here but they were very calm and I never saw them trying to get anything from people. From here its tight metal steps and no places to stop but not as bad as it looks from the bottom. Once at the top of the fortress there is beautiful views over Sri Lanka. Easy to spend and hour or so wandering around and some places to sit and enjoy the views too. Definitely worth the money. Not sure how anyone can moan about the difference for tourists and locals - is their country of course they should enjoy it cheaper and tourists who can afford to travel should pay more to upkeep this beautiful place.","May 19, 2023",0.0,0.0

There are govt approved guides at base if you want to have a little history lesson and guide all the way to the top. I declined because I wanted to experience without alot of talk. Obviously  I went when  tourism was down in sri lanka so there were only about maybe 25 people or so I got to enjoy to myself. I took over a 100 photos and had all developed. There is photo opportunities at every step. The hike up and down took me about 3 hrs but I took my time, its steep but I'm used to hiking uphill. I can say it's safe but I would recommend being fit. The cost as I saw some complaining is NOT expensive of what you get to see. This is on the same scale as Machu picchu or chichennitza in cancun. So ignore those posts. $30is nothing to someone who comes from the west and travels that far!!. On a historical note this fortress dates 500 yrs before Christ.

Actually, the experience is amazing! There were almost no people, shorter or none queues. Just bring a raincoat or an umbrella, and open sandals, and you will be fine. The complex consists from the rock that you will climb using the famous stairs. In the second half of this journey, there is something called Mirror Wall and then frescoes, which is a small cave with very old pictures with still vivid colors. The place is full of self-employed tour guides - locals that will follow you around, saying that they are tour guides and that you definitely need one. Then they will walk with you, talk with you, and expect money at the end. We were warned that there is no need for a tour guide and that the place is mostly about walking the stairs and the view afterwards. Lion's Paws is the stairway where are normally those long lines of people that are trying to get to the top of the rock. At t the base of the stairs, there are statues in a form of lion's paws, so hence the name. This place is what you want to experience when someone talks about Sigiriya Rock. And form my experience, it's the biggest fun! The Mirror Wall itself is not that wow, I would say. It's not shiny anymore, you can't touch it, it's just therein its not shiny form. Frescoes that are waiting for you at the end of the line are much more interesting, since it's something to look at. The line leading to the frescoes is heading among the Mirror Wall. It's not possible to take pictures of frescoes, thought, there is a lot of staff watching everyone so nobody does it. I didn't see any toilets on the way, just those at the ticket office. So count with that, if you want to spend few hours of wondering at the place, or if the queues on the particular day are too long.","March 28, 2023",0.0,0.0

Easy climb. We really enjoyed the views. Only reason I’m giving it a 2 starts is because of our guide. We actually had a great time once he left us alone. Be careful with tour guides and “helpers” We had a man following us from the start and he was talking about the Sigiriya Rock. After approximately 5 minutes he stated that he was a freelance guide and offered to accompany us to the top while telling us about the history of this rock fortress. He stated that he didn’t have a price and we could decide at the end what to pay him depending on how we liked his services. We agreed. About 5 minutes after that he brought us to a man selling “magic boxes” and insisted we try to open them. We were not interested in buying any boxes. A few minutes after that his friend arrived and started “helping” me up the stairs. I did not ask for help nor was it needed.  He insisted on holding onto my hand however it was very awkward and opposite of helpful. It quickly became hazardous as none of the steps are the same size and walking with a stranger like that out of the blue was weird. This helping up the steps became annoying and I tried numerous times to stop it but he kept holding his hand out. My husband was actually walking behind us and thought it was the funniest thing.  It’s funny now looking back at it. He even snapped some photos. After a few more sets of steps I had to tell my husband that I am not climbing 1200 steps and up the rock like this. Luckily we were still in the beginning. My husband told our guide who translated to the helper that his assistance was not needed. We were then told he doesn’t work for free! Our guide then told us that his services were $40-$50! We paid less for a taxi drive with all our luggage from the airport to our hotel! Be careful! We told both of them to have a nice day however the guide still wanted money for his services “thus far”   Ruins the experience!,"March 3, 2023",0.0,0.0
