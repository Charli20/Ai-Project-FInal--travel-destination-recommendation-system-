Atmosphere both inside and outside are awesome. In addition to the main theater it has an outdoor event area as well. Been there for indoor musical events and I must say the experience is superb. Sound quality is very good and the stage is clearly visible without any obstruction from front rows. There’s ample parking space outside the theater and you don’t need to worry about finding a parking spot. A small cafe is there inside which sells snacks and cool drinks. The only drawback I have experienced is that they don’t allow taking any food or beverages inside the theater. Even no water bottles. So you have to fill yourself before entering the theater. Anyways, A must have experience at least once.","April 4, 2019",0.0,0.0

Polonnaruwa's Nelum Pokuna is shaped as an eight-petaled lotus flower. China showed willingness to construct a cultural theatre in Colombo, in memory of Ex-President Chandrika Kumaratunga's late husband Vijaya Kumaratunga who was a popular actor. The construction began in 2006 and took four years to build and completed in early 2011. The total estimated cost of the project is LKR 3080 million. Government of the People's Republic of China offered LKR 2430 million. It covers an floor area of more than 14,000 square metres. The theatre has ultra modern facilities such as an auditorium with 1,288 seats, a library, and training facilities. There are two types of main auditoriums namely the indoor and Open air theatre.  It has the ability to convert the front steps into an additional open-air theatre  making it as the 3rd one. Nelum Pokun is a very impressive structure having excellent facilities and it is great venue. Remarkable conference facilities are also available here. The 690-square-metre moving stage in the auditorium includes the ability to raise and lower the orchestra pit to and from stage level to 5 ½  feet up or down.. There are facilities to conduct educational and research activities. Nelum Pokuna is a lovely attraction and a land mark to the Colombo city with an unique shape of architecture. You should go in and have a look and you will be amazed. The look from outside is not a match to its inside lush extravagant outfit. Nelum Pokuna in Sinhala means “the Lotus Pond” in English. It was called prior to naming it officially  as “National Performing Arts Theatre”. It was ceremonially opened by Sri Lankan Ex-President Mahinda Rajapakse and China's Vice President of the Chinese Republican Committee, Sang Chiang on the 15th of December 2011. Lanka popular and high ranked artistes, such as Jayantha Chandrasiri, Rohana Weerasinghe and Pandith Amaradeva as singers and Channa Wijewardena (as dancer) performed at the opening ceremony. A Chinese opera was also shown on the opening. The Chinese opera depicted the story of fourth-century Chinese-Buddhist monk Fa-Hsien's travels to Sri Lanka. Both performances used the Seda Mawatha concept, incorporating both film and drama.  The performances for public started in the early 2012. In November 2013, first symphony orchestra concert was shown by the Commonwealth Festival Orchestra, with 87 musicians from the UK, India and the Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka, conducted by James Ross. The Nelum Pokuna Theatre was the site of the opening ceremony of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2013. The quality of the performers was enhanced by the great acoustics of theater and so the music was really good. Nelum Pokuna is located in a strategic place in the heart of Colombo where 3 star, 5 star hotels, shopping malls and commercial establishments are not far away from this point. Therefore the foreign delegates could have their conferences, discussions or gatherings here as it is situated in shorter distances to their lodgings. The seats are very well cushioned and fairly broad giving much comfort when seated. The leg space is also great.  There is ample parking area for 500 vehicles and do not have to worry about having to look for such places and avoids walking from there to the Nelum Pokuna. It also make tourists happy as some important attractions are at a walking distances to the Nelum Pokuna. They are Art Gallery, Viharamahadevi Park, National Museum, War Memorial and the Town Hall. Nelum Pokuna is managed by the Military personnel, at-least providing an excellent security. When I went inside the premises along with a friend, one army person came to me and informed to go towards the office direction. In that place, an army lady came to us and took us inside of the Hall. It was fabulous. Taking of photos inside the auditorium is not allowed. She allowed me to take photos when I showed her my visiting card as Level 6 Trip Advisor Contributor. Even she told me to go to the stage to take snaps. You can surf the Nelum Pokuna web to check for performances and their timings. Both locals and the tourists could get benefit from the performances done here. It's a massive step up, considering Sri Lanka didn't have a large-scale theatre halls before. You were not allowed to take in and food or water bottles into the theater to avoid people dropping crumbs and wrappers and make a mess of things. All in all, Nelum Pokuna is a must to Sri Lanka to see performances of arts with a quality audio and with moving sub stages.I recommend you strongly to visit the place.","March 20, 2017",0.0,0.0

The theatre looks rather classy but bombastic from the outside but the interior is desperately drab and depressing: imagine a 1970s retro theatre and you're about right. It was funded by the Chinese and bears the name of Sri Lanka's last president just voted out of office but not before naming countless buildings after himself in true dictatorial fashion. The Sri Lankans deserve better!,"April 22, 2015",0.0,0.0
