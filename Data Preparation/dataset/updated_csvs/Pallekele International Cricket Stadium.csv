England - and England won an exciting game!Only two drawbacks: 1) We were in an air-conditioned box which had access to covered external seating at the front of the box. On Day 1 it took some time to persuade the authorities to unlock the door so that we could get access to the seats in front that we had paid for! They seemed quite happy, though, for us to go to the box next door and climb over the low wall separating our box from theirs! What is more, that low wall was - how can I put it - at exactly the wrong height for average-height gentlemen to cross in comfort 2) Our catering in the box offered beer or coke (only). When we asked for diet coke, they went and got what they claimed as was diet coke - but wasn't. This isn't just annoying, it's dishonest and potentially dangerous. It was not until Day 4 of the match that we managed to convince them that Diet Coke (along with Diet Fanta and two other diet drinks) was available on the ground and in fact was cheaper than the full-sugar version!;","December 23, 2018",0.0,0.0

We had pre-booked seats online and selected a spot where according to the seat map on bookmyshow.lk we had the last seats in the row. These were selected as we had our 14 month old daughter with us as we could then use the space for her stroller. Stadium facilities were really good with good security on arrival , efficient ticket collection at the office and well layed out and marked directions to the seating areas. On arrival at our seats we found completely different setup as compared to the layout provided. Many fans from the grass embankments had slid through some gaps in the barrier to occupy the additional seats. Police officers really couldnt do much to keep track of who was meant to be there and who wasnt. The seats and viewing area were great. Fans were generally very enthusiastic and respectful bar one character who clearly had a few too many lion lagers 😊. This is generally the case at international games, but this guy was a pest of note and clearly was one of the original ""sliders"" as mentioned earlier. Exiting the stadium was well managed and ofcourse the traffic itself meant a few extra minutes more than on arrival. I have been to many cricket matches and I should say that this was by far the easiest to access and exit which is great when having little kids with you. The result didnt go our way but the experience was very good. Crowd control could be better in terms of segregation of the areas and looking into the controls around both the ticketing layouts and potential zones for breach.","September 8, 2016",0.0,0.0

Not a second sitting down for the 4 hrs tho. Food was fine... hot dogs ice creams and kfc on the way in and brought around during the game. Tuk tuk from kandy was 1000lkr there but on the way back we took some sort of shortcut which knocked off half the time. I assume we went the scenic way there. No worries as price was pre negotiated. One word of warning for fmls. I was with my husband in the throng of people leaving and had people grabbing me all.over in the crush and darkness. I was dressed conservativly with pants and a high neck top and it has been the only time i felt unsafe in SL.

Even the more expensive seats were very reasonably priced. The ground is fairly simple with a grandstand on one side and grassy banks on the other from where you can bring a picnic sit and watch.

Although it's a bit of a drive out of Kandy, especially if you are using a tuk or bus, the location is wonderful and the ground well designed to give you a good view of the surrounding areas. The entrance is well kept, covered by beautiful arching trees. the ground itself offers you a very intimate experience as the boundary ropes are practically on the edge of the spectator's area. The grass banks offer a colourful, sound-filled atmosphere, while the stand probably gives you more comfort with just as good a view.","January 26, 2015",0.0,0.0

It was easy to buy tickets from the booth on the day of the match.  Though tourists do pay more you can choose which price tier to opt for.  The ground has a beautiful setting with lovely views of the overlooking hills.  Attendants were very helpful the whole day. The refreshments were cheap and plentiful.  The beer was very cheap, but they had lovely iced tea and ice creams/lollys too.  Some people weren't a fan of the food but I quite liked the hot dogs and chips they had. Ladies - the ladies loo's are not marked apart from men's one but the attendants will direct you.  But the ones in the stand were proper loo's not long drops thankfully.  Bring tissues as it runs out. Also I was followed in to the loo by some young lads - luckily an older woman had come out of the loo at the time and in a very stern school teacher voice told them loudly that this was a ladies loo.  So maybe have someone wait outside for you.  This was the only time I felt uneasy the whole of my trip.  And only the once during the two days I was at the cricket in Kandy. But I felt worth mentioning. However, on a better note I got chatting to some lovely people during the match and had a wonderful time.  It was one of the best days of my trip. (plus England won)  I found the home fans to be really friendly.  I even got asked to have my picture with quite a few people.  Great memories.  Hopefully I'll be back again","January 19, 2015",0.0,0.0

Just ask any of the drivers for Pallekelle and they'll tell you which bus to get on.  With minor traffic it took around 30 minutes (but we stood both times - lots of folks going to cricket!) If you've reserved a ticket, then you pick them up by the main entrance (to the right of the security check), through a barred gate.  Take your invoice or an electronic copy of it. It's a lovely ground.  We were in B Lower both times and it was a great view.  Hint - if there's anything looking like rain on the horizon make sure you pick a seat that's going to be protected by the grandstand roof.  Once you've got your seat, you can't really leave it (unless you leave someone behind to hold it for you). Going to cricket at Pallekelle is like going to a Sri Lankan party.  Great fun.  (even when it rains). Lion Beer is cheap at 200 LKR for a large beer or 120 LKR for a smaller one.  Ice creams for 50 LKR.  Apart from that food options are appallingly bad.  Do yourself a favor and take food with you - the security bag check don't bother about food and soft drinks (not sure about beer though) - otherwise your options are hot dogs, fries and fish rolls. Buses to return to Kandy will be packed, so either head away from Kandy to the previous stop and try and get on there, or get yourself a tuktuk - you'll probably be paying 1000 LKR to return to Kandy if it's busy.  Or if you're extremely lucky like we were, find yourself a Sri Lankan family who has room in their car and wants to talk cricket..","January 2, 2015",0.0,0.0
