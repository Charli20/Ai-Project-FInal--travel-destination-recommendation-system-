Located between the reservoir Tissa Wewa and the Isurumuni temple is this 40 acre garden Ranmasu Uyana used by ancient royals.  The stone ponds and pavilions here are said to have been established in the 8th and 9th centuries BCE, though now in ruins. The shower houses and the stone ponds are the main attraction in the garden.  The water provided to these had been directed through a network of underground pipes and channels starting from the nearby Tissa Wewa reservoir.  Ancient engineers had designed a rain-like water spray system at the chambers for the use and pleasure of the royalty. We spent about 45 minutes enjoying the beauty and tranquil atmosphere.","January 7, 2026",0.0,0.0

It’s over 2,000 years old and feels like a secret royal garden, hidden among rocks and trees. There’s even a mysterious carving called the “Star Gate,” which made me even more curious.

Royal gardens were first constructed here in the time of King Tissa (3rd century BC) when the reservoir was built. However, the pleasure pavilions and other fixtures are seen today date from the 8th-9th centuries AD. This pleasure garden was also known as ‘Magul Uyana’ and served as an ancient recreation park once enjoyed by a succession of monarchs of ancient Anuradhapura over the centuries. The elaborately laid-out garden complex epitomises ancient Sri Lanka’s innovative landscape architecture and engineering excellence. රන්මසු උයන එය ඉසුරුමුණිය විහාරස්ථානයට යාබද අනුරාධපුර පූජා නගරයේ පිහිටි පුරාණ රාජකීය උද්‍යානයකි. මෙහි ප්‍රථම වරට රාජකීය උද්‍යාන ඉදිකරන ලද්දේ තිස්ස රජුගේ කාලයේ (ක්‍රි.පූ. 3 වන සියවස) ජලාශය ඉදිකරන විටය. කෙසේ වෙතත්, විනෝද මණ්ඩප සහ අනෙකුත් සවිකිරීම් අද දක්නට ලැබෙන්නේ ක්‍රිස්තු වර්ෂ 8-9 සියවස් වලට අයත් වේ. මෙම විනෝද උද්‍යානය 'මඟුල් උයන' ලෙසද හඳුන්වනු ලැබූ අතර, සියවස් ගණනාවක් පුරා පුරාණ අනුරාධපුරයේ රජවරුන් අනුප්‍රාප්තිකයා විසින් භුක්ති වින්දා පැරණි විනෝද උද්‍යානයක් ලෙසද සේවය කළේය. සවිස්තරාත්මකව සකස් කර ඇති උද්‍යාන සංකීර්ණය පුරාණ ශ්‍රී ලංකාවේ නව්‍ය භූ දර්ශන ගෘහ නිර්මාණ ශිල්පය සහ ඉංජිනේරු විශිෂ්ටත්වය සංකේතවත් කරයි.","December 17, 2024",0.0,0.0

I read some rumours/ opinions saying that these are some kind of communication carved into the stone with some kind of aliens.

Almost Everyone visit  Isurumuniya, when they are in Anuradhapura, but within a five minute walk from Isurumuniya is this architectural marvel, a stone structure, a pond or a bath, with intricate carvings. There is also the Star Gate or Sakvala Chakra, carved on the rock nearby, which nobody has yet been able to decipher.It has nicely built ponds and the structures are amazing. Tourists call it Royal GoldFish Park.  It has some beliefs about this place being Sakwala Chakraya or the Stargate of Ranmasu Uyana.  It is said this was built by King Mutasiwa and after Arhath Mihindu bringing the Budhdhism the king Devanampiyathissa has donated the park to the Sangha for meditation. It will take about 30 minutes to see the place and it is nice to see the historic architecture of 2500 years back where no machinery was  used.  They have taken the water from Tissa wewa reservoir to these tanks by the tunnels. This is the royal garden and not a religious site. There are two ponds made in ancient times in this location. You can park you vehicle in Isurumiuniya temple car park and walk down to extreme left hand corner (when walking from car park entrance), where you will find the board of this site. You can't drive closer to this site. Near the second pond you will see ruins of a building /foundation between two rocks, which i think is a alternative for concrete slabs used in ancient times (please see the photos) You can walk on to bank of Thissa wewa (tank) from here. Ranmasu Uyana is a park which was used by the kings who ruled Anuradhapura. There are many ponds and baths which were entirely carved out of rock. There are drainage systems made out of bricks to drain the water away from the park. The park is situated near the Tisa Wewa and the ponds get their water from the tank and this system has been working for a millennium. The park is never crowded as it is unknown to most of the tourists who visit Anuradhapura. Sometimes you may be the only one in the premises. It is another lovely spot in Anuradhapura. The two ponds are well worth a visit and the one on the right has some nice elephant carvings. If you carry on around the back of that pond behind the rocks there is a path that runs to a carving on a large rock . All structures are surrounded by man-made water streams. Ponds were filled with water. Still some of the water paths are working. The slope of the land is used to set the paths of the streams. This garden shows the ancient knowledge of use of water pressure. According to the historians and legend this is where prince Saliya and Asokamaala had met. The ruins are still under preservations, therefore there is much more to discover, yet each stoned pond have its own carved designs and some are not that clear. This is a must visit place. Many miss it as they don't know that it is there but well worth the extra few yards from Isurumuniya. Therefore make sure to take a good look at the ruins. Go and see it.","April 15, 2018",0.0,0.0

There was mechanism to decrease the water pressure and distribute water all over the garden. It is a must visit place to have a look on how the Sri Lankan royals spent their leisure time 1500-2000 year ago.

Everyone visits Isurumuniya, when they are in Anuradhapura, but within a five minute walk from Isurumuniya is this architectural marvel, a stone structure, a pond or a bath, with intricate carvings. There is also the Star Gate or Sakvala Chakra, carved on the rock nearby, which nobody has yet been able to decipher.","October 6, 2016",0.0,0.0

It has nicely built ponds and the structures are amazing. Tourists call it Royal GoldFish Park. And it has some beliefs about this place being Sakwala Chakraya or the Stargate of Ranmasu Uyana. It is said this was built by King Mutasiwa and after Arhath Mihindu bringing the Budhdhism the king Devanampiyathissa has donated the park to the Sangha for meditation. Will take about 30 minutes to see the place and nice to see the historic architecture 2500 years back where no mahcinery was available but how they have taken the water from Thisa wewa reservoir to these tanks under the tunnels.,"August 29, 2016",0.0,0.0

I have missed this place may time even having visited Isurumuniya. This is the royal garden and not a religious site. There are two ponds made in ancient times in this location. For me this is one of the master pieces of Anuradhapura time. You can park you vehicle in Isurumiuniya temple car park and walk down to extreme left hand corner (when walking from car park entrance), where you will find the board of this site. You can't drive closer to this site. Near the second pond you will see ruins of a building /foundation between two rocks, which i think is a alternative for concrete slabs used in ancient times (please see the photos) Access to this place is free of charge. You can walk on to bank of Thissa wewa (tank) from here.","August 8, 2016",0.0,0.0

The Isurumuniya temple is situated near the park. In the park, there are many ponds and baths which were entirely carved out of rock. There are drainage systems made out of bricks to drain the water away from the park. The park is situated near the Tisa Wewa and the ponds get their water from the tank and this system has been working for a millennium. The park is never crowded as it is unknown to most of the tourists who visit Anuradhapura. Sometimes you may be the only one in the premises.","February 21, 2016",0.0,0.0

The two ponds are well worth a visit and the one on the right has some nice elephant carvings. If you carry on around the back of that pond behind the rocks there is a path that runs to a carving on a large rock that some think is the worlds oldest map. It is certainly of a symbolic nature and you can make out representations of various creatures on it.
