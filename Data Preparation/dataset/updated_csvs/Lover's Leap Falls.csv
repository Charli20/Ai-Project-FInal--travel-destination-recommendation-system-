The walk to the falls takes you through lush tea plantations, making the journey just as scenic as the destination. The waterfall itself is stunning, cascading from around 30 meters high into a quiet, green setting. The site is tied to a local legend about two lovers who leapt to their fate from this very spot, adding a sense of history and mystery to the visit. The path is relatively easy to access, but wearing comfortable shoes is recommended as it can be slightly uneven. This is a great stop if you want to enjoy nature, take in the views, and capture some beautiful photos away from the busy town. It’s not a large waterfall, but the charm of the area and the surrounding tea estates make it well worth a visit.","September 3, 2025",0.0,0.0

Backstory - According folklore a prince who lived in the area during ancient times fell in love with a village girl and when his parents opposed match, the ill fated lovers chose to jump to their death from the top of this waterfall on a full moon day rather than be seperated. Hence the name.... ""Lover's leap""....... How to get there - There were so many conflicting reviews on how to get there and the level of difficulty in getting there.... This was our experience.. After reading many reviews we took the longer route (second option) shown on Google maps and that was to get to the Pedro tea factory. Just as you see the factory (coming from NE side) there is a left turn (carpeted road) to the estate managers bungalow ,as indicated on the turnoff. After about 200 meters down this road you get two left turns (at the same point). Our tuk driver took the upper left turn which was in terrible conditon with large pot holes. There are more turnoffs down this road but you always take the turnoff going up.... after about 10-15 mts you will get to a large tree from where the path turns into a footpath... from there it's only about 250 meters to the waterfall. Halfway through path you come to a gate and fence seeming fencing off a makeshift kovil. You take the right turn next to the gate and after about 50 meters the road again forks into two from which you take the lower route to the left. ( I read on reviews that the locals will offer to take you to the top of the waterfall. So I assume the right turn off would lead to the top of the waterfall. But there were no locals in sight on the day we visited, so we didn't explore any further.) The walking part was pretty easy. It wasn't flat land but nothing particularly strenuous. We also noticed that there was a concrete paved road down below coming almost upto the waterfall. This may have been the lower road in the first turnoff, but then again non of the tuk drivers coming to falls seemed to take this route. There was enough water flow to make it worthwhile when we visited, but it may not warrant a visit during dry season.","December 30, 2024",0.0,0.0

Some local was realizing that and he was guiding people up to the waterfall in exchange of some money. I didn't like that he just joined me and my boyfriend and suddenly became a part of walk, since we didn't ask him and I felt bothered. The place is free of charge. You can either park at some parking lot a bit further away, or at the street under the hill, but then you need to walk a lot up to the hill. What was disappointing was that right when you get to the waterfall, there is a fence that protects people from walking further and probably hurting themselves. It makes sense that it's there, but it prevents you from creating a nice picture of the waterfall.

You can see a eagle view of nuwaraeliya town. Lovers leap is an impressive water fall which is known for its romantic folklore. To reach this place one has to go through the tea factory and reach the tea manager’s bungalow along a dirt road. Visitors can reach this destination by following the signs that are there and eventually one can reach a rock face and a Shiva shrine. Just beyond the shrine one can see the cascading water fall.

We thought the ride was definitely worth the roughly $8US (1500 SKR), although it was rough and taxed the tuk-tuks lower gears. It had also drizzled all morning so it was muddy and slippery, which this option allowed us to avoid.

Our driver took us to the locality, from where we took a tuk tuk for half the ride up amidst the tea plantations. Since the path is full of stones and very narrow, normal cars cannot go up, however tuk tuks can easily access the place. For serious hikers, they can go for the climb all the way till the falls. En route, the view is enthralling, with team plantations all around and if the weather is on your side, there is little mist and clouds. As we went in December, we continued to experience rainfall throughout our journey. Once the tuk tuk parked at it's last accessible spot, we took a short hike up (around a kilometre). Ensure to wear proper hiking shoes as because of the waterfall, the area is wet, with lots of small streams flowing, making the path slippery. There are also loose stones and wet ones, so shoes with a good grip will help. If you have not climbed before, be careful of your footing, however for most part, its a fairly easy climb. Also be prepared to get wet! Needless to say, the water from the waterfall will get you soaked. Mind you, we were just on one side of the waterfall and not in its way, however the pressure sends water sprays that soak you completely. Some of us went prepared and were fine... others like me felt we jumped into the water :) Its a fantastic view and very rejuvenating to be in the midst of nature and I really enjoyed it. With the cold and wet weather of Nuwara Eliya, note that clothes DO NOT dry easily, unless you have heaters or fans.","December 8, 2019",0.0,0.0

Very much worth paying for if you don’t fancy the trek or aren’t fit enough. I wouldn’t recommend walking the entire hill with small children or if you aren’t in a fit & healthy time in your life. We only had to share the space with another group of young people for about 10mins before having it to ourselves. It’s a very quiet and non touristy place.

The start of the walk is actually well signposted from the main road and, not surprisingly, you need to go uphill. The walk is through plantations, and is not taxing.  When you reach a temple, you head up a small track and quickly come upon the waterfall.  It was not flowing heavily when we were there (Jan).

Lovers Leap is the main source of water for the entire Nuwara Eliya valley, so visitors are asked to be considerate of the water and not contaminate it. The name Lovers Leap kind of betrays the legend: a prince fell in love with a beautiful maiden living in the valley but his father opposed the union, so he took his beloved and together they leapt to their tragic demise, their love forever immortalized by the folly of their youth and a waterfall that is visited by many from far and wide.","January 4, 2017",0.0,0.0

Though people named it as Lover's leap falls, nobody knows when this couple have jumped from the waterfall. There is a foot pathway on right hand side of the waterfall to reach the top of the waterfall. (Better have a known person for this). If you go upstream you may find 5-6 waterfalls, called Piduruthalagala cascades. I have been there and it is advisable to go with a guide.","February 9, 2016",0.0,0.0

The lover's leap waterfall is located inside a tea estate - you have to park your vehicle inside the estate and walk/hike for about 2km, which is not quite an easy walk, however, the destiny is perfectly worth it. The two times I visited here, it was not crowded like most other waterfalls in N'Eliya, so you are kind of stepping in your private tranquility. One time, we met two foriegners who were just lying and relaxing on a large rock beneath the waterfall, who had been there for hours!!! I would say, it's quite small compared to other waterfalls, however the beauty and its surrounding lives up to it. If you are really carefull, you could get close - i mean really close to the water fall, carefuly stepping on the rocks. There's one place where you can even climb halfway to the waterfall and actually get behind it. I had been eager to try this, but never got the chance. Perhaps next time :) In short, if you are in Nuwaraeliya, this is one fairyland of a place which you should not miss.","April 25, 2015",0.0,0.0

It's hard work, and we learned that they pick on average of 20 kilos of leaf tips per day to earn the princely sum of 6 dollars.
