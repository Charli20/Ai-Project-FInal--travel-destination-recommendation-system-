In my opinion, entering the island should be prohibited immediately. There would certainly be ways to make snorkeling here much more environmentally friendly – for example, by letting visitors swim in the water from the boat to the beautiful spots instead of letting them off on land. Compulsory life jackets could also help tourists to avoid touching or accidentally damaging sensitive corals. I don't understand how to exploit such a unique treasure for money at such short notice rather than protecting it sustainably. Of course, I am aware that the population in Sri Lanka is very poor in many places – but that is precisely why this wealth of nature should be preserved in the long term, rather than irretrievably destroyed by mass rush and lack of rules. It's bitter to see one of the most beautiful places I've ever wanted to experience being so doomed.","August 26, 2025",0.0,0.0

One wonders what will be done with the 40€/person entrance fee for the national park. Shouldn't this be meant to protect this sensitive zone? Many people stand on the corals, many are already broken. There seems to be no awareness of conservation. The underwater world is still very beautiful, it was an experience for the children. But from a conservation point of view, we can't really recommend this.

Then they have to go snorkelling under the ‘guidance’ of a guide and ready again. The result is that a relentless stream of people snorkel the same round. The result is that groups swim right through each other, which means that the overview is lost. Our guide had no idea how many people he had in his group. He did count along the way, but if you don't know what you're counting then it all gets very tricky. Two children were missing afterwards. One reported himself the second took a very long time. And besides the supervisors being busy shouting at each other, not much action was taken. Besides this, don't think when you come here that you can snorkel at your own pace in a spot of your own choosing. Save you the money (we paid US$70 pp) and effort. I'm sure there are cheaper, prettier and more laid-back alternatives nearby.","August 12, 2025",0.0,0.0

The tour company we used was good with a nice guide who paid special attention to our 11 year old child. It is expensive but I believe most of the fees are national park fees - at least I hope that’s the case! On the negative side, the coral in the shallow area around the island is mostly dead and there were far too many people there at the same time. It is clearly suffering from over tourism which by visiting it ourselves we know we are contributing to. Therefore mixed feelings about going as not sure what will be left at pigeon island in a few years if tourism continues there at the current rate.

Snorkeling: Corals are almost all dead but many sea-turtles and black-tip reef shark. However, the snorkeling gear provided is exceptionally poor and almost completely ruining the experience. I very much recommend renting snorkeling gear from one of the proper dive centers (e.g. Pearl dive center) or at the very minimum, asking to see and fit snorkeling gear prior to departing/paying. Snorkles were the kind you buy for children in a toy-store. Mask was too little for me and no soap provided, so besides taking in water, it quickly got foggy. My daughters snorkle took in water and at least for her, the snorkeling was pointless despite sharks and turtles. Earlier same day, we had excellent snorkeling trip with Pearl Divers but they don’t have access to Pigeon Island. Note fairly high prices due to special admission fee for national park. Just prior to closing time (17:00) my daughter had the great/fun experience of walking in shallow water opposite side of snorkeling and 2 baby sharks came swimming by. This made the entire trip worth it.","July 31, 2025",0.0,0.0

I wanted to love it. Went with our 4 kids ages 16,13,10,10. It absolutely is not suitable for 10 year olds. The snorkelling on the near side of the island is rough and deep and not safe for young kids. Our guide did not inform us it was deep snorkelling with really strong swimming skills needed. We stopped after 5 mins to get life jackets for the 10 year olds but it was too tough for them. So they headed back with my wife. I continued with my older 2. We did see sharks and amazing fish. There are far too many people there. Our guide actually lost us meaning we ended up being washed up on shallow coral which was obviously awful for the coral.

It’s true that there’s some dead corals but definitely a great variety of fishes. And lots of sharks. I’ve seen 8 in literally 10 minutes on the side where the boats are coming from. I think they should warn people about how to behave as occasionally might chase swimmers (a local told me after). I got circled around and charged by 3 black tips, about a meter/and half long for 3 times. And I had to take refuge on the reef to escape. Not sure what went wrong as I’ve been diving with sharks before and I guess when I started panicking, I did all the wrong things (sudden movements, splashing and shouting). But I had literally two of them on my fins while swimming away from them. Bad story, but I think should be mentioned for others safety. On this I’d like to add: boat price is 2500k period (locals and foreigners) don’t let other guys fool you as we got all sort of prices starting from 7000. Price included going there and back and you can easily stay all day with no price difference. We’ve been charged 600 each for snorkeling equipment, which I also think is probably to bargain it down to 300 Entry tickets is now 10$ plus 8$ service charge per person, it’d be curious to know what is the service charge for.

Even six years ago it was not the ""hidden gem"" anymore but it was not too crowded and one could believe that the guards of the national park might be there to protect the enviorment. But now it's 2019. Masses of tourists were brought to Pigeon Island and it's a challenge to get into the deep water, fighting against arms and legs, paddeling like mad, you can see that there much to much people that doesn't know how to behave in the water or just how to move in the water. We got away from the entrance point as quick as possible and in the deeper water it got better. Yes, you might see fish. We saw at leat 7 black-tipped-Reef Sharks one Turtle...nothing to complain, one could say. And we saw tourists that entdered the inner, strictly protected part of the reef, went on swimming while guards were yelling at them, finally climbing the top of the reef and walking on the reef top. Yes, I complained. I complained why there are no guards that really take care, complained why there are signpostings indicating the fee that is to be payed when someone destroys parts of the reef....but the guards of the so called national park are here to get the entrance fee and to organise the landings of the ships, not to disturb the paying tourists. No, there are no regulations you have to obey (of course there are, but nobody cares about it). Yes, there are certain tourists that didn't know how to behave, not really able to control themselves, needing life vests to be protected from drowning, well equipped with long sleeves and gloves that made it easy to touch and finally to walk on the reef. I really felt angry and disappointed when leaving that island. You might feel the same, if you would go there.

However, I would say the experience completely depends on the guide. As mentioned in many reviews, you need to pay for a boat ride and entry ticket for the island. Prices of both are very variable and all of it is bit chaotic, so my recommendation would be to offer what is within your budget. We paid 35$ each including boat ride, guide, snorkeling gear and entrance fee. But we were happy to pay higher price to have a private boat and guide just for 2 of us. Our guide was knowledgeable and showed us turtles, sharks and other fishes. From our past experience in Great Barrier Reef, this reef is small but having a guide to show you the main parts of the reef was the highlight. Much of the reef is damaged/ dead however was also good to see some new corals growing albeit bleached.

First 2 days we were unable to go but we got lucky on the third day of our trip. We took a boat ride from the trinco beach; the cost of which included the ride to the island itself and the entry fees. Rates differ for locals and foreigners but I’d say it’s worth it. There are many places offering tours along the trinco beach. The pigeon island itself is quite small. The water is crystal clear and you can see the reef fish even from the very edge of the beach! The reef houses numerous varieties of fish and it’s absolutely beautiful.  The water is quite shallow and snorkeling around the reef is easy even for a beginner. The boat rides usually leave in the morning around 8.30/9 and return after lunch. It’s advisable to take your own water bottle (hopefully reusable) and snacks.

Actually they’re under 2 meters and not aggressive, but don’t get close. The wildlife is tame, bad for the ecosystem but great for close fish encounters. A turtle felt comfortable coming within one meter. Coral is returning, especially antler and blue. A few more years without a bad El Nino (warming sea event) would be great. Don’t go unless you can snorkel and swim for 15 minutes or longer without touching bottom; you can’t stand up beyond 10 meters or so (it kills coral.)

Initially we were out off doing this trip as there were reports of overcrowding and reef damage. But on our last day we decided to give it a go. And we were so glad we did! It’s a beautiful spot, just 20 mins boat ride from Uppuveli beach. It’s a national reserve so permits have to be obtained by the boat man en route; a quick job. You need to visit both sides of the island to get the most out of it. The boat moors on the side viewed from onshore and u then walk across (a couple of mins) to the back side. The sea life is very different on both sides. The back side of the island has better visibility. Be warned there is a lot of broken coral and it is painful on the feet; if you have beach shoes or wetsuit boots bring them! Short fins which you can hire also work. We have done a lot of snorkelling/ diving all over the world and based on reports weren’t expecting much; well what a surprise! The abundance of different varieties of sea life was huge. So many different species of fish, squid, turtles and sharks. We saw 3 (think black tip sharks) at very close quarters on the shore side of the island. On the other side we saw turtles, incl a large hawksbill turtle who we swam with for some time. They have 2 types of turtle in Sri Lanka. At the time of our visit there were quite a few jellyfish but then it was just after a storm so it’s probably not always an issue. They aren’t poisonous but u may get a mild sting which soon goes. At some times of the year they have the ‘red jellyfish’ which is poisonous so check before u do the trip. The rangers hut on the island has vinegar which will relieve a sting.

After the trip all of us had mixed feelings. On the one hand we were excited, because we saw sea turtles and sharks. On the other hand we were very sad, because due to the mass tourism the nature in and arround Pigeon Island really suffers. The coral reef around Pigeon Island is almost completely destroyed. Apart from watching sharks and turtles the submarine world offers a sad picture. Furthermore most of boats are quite old, i.e. many boats loose petrol and pollute the sea.

It was heartwrenching to see how they treat the marine life in Sri Lanka. This is a national park and nothing is done to conserve the corals or fish. They had one small plot where you were not aloud to swim because they were preserving corals there. The whole trip was extremely badly organised. Noone spoke any English. Noone told people not to touch or step on the corals. The locals were standing on coral, shouting and screaming the whole time. I'm not sure if this is because of lack of knowledge and education? If it is this is really something the government should consider teaching if they don't want the whole sea to be ruined. I realize that this is a business opportunity for people who do not have much else, but this is not an honorable way to earn a buck. We got there at 8.30 and were one of the first boats. 30 minutes later you could hardly move around it was that crowded. The boats kept coming and going all trough the time we were there, crashing into each other at the beach. No safety whatsoever. The boat drivers didn't speak English and we were just given a broken snorkel and they told us they would come back for us three hours later. After five minutes in the water fending for your space we gave up and went to the beach. We saw a few fish, clearly distressed from all the commotion and people. This place is dying under water and it is all because of people. It was so sad to see... Most of the other western tourists we meet had the same feeling. There were a bunch of jelly fish in the water that sting. Badly. They did not give us any information about this and one girl had an allergic reaction after being stung on the neck. There are also some extremely dangerous jelly fish abit further out... Which we found out after being in the water. Turtles had laid eggs on the island the previous night and the locals kept running over the eggs, sitting on them and really not giving a f*** It was terrible to see the condition the corals were in and how the locals treated the place. Most of the locals can't swim and walked from coral to coral. The water was extremely murky due to the amount of people. This trip made me wonder what the conservation area are doing with all the money they get from arranging the snorkling trips. They had one trash can and it was filthy. No place to leave your things.

Anyone who doesn't past here will rate it 1 out of 5 2.  However, once you get past this there is some pretty decent snorkelling. The best coral was to the right as you face the sea so head over there and go out a bit further and there is plenty to see.  I've done plenty of diving and wouldn't be unhappy to see this on a dive. 3.  There is also good fish life here, we saw a Black Tip Reef Shark close up as well as the usual mix of tropical fish. 4. On the side where the boats come in there is a cordoned off area where they are trying to re-grow the coral and you can see an entire bed of new coral.

One brushed against my son's arm with no ill effects, one lady was picking them up to photograph (!) However, the sight of so many of them is off putting. People do trample the coral, and the stamping about does cloud the water near to shore, but to be fair the coral starts at the beach so it's difficult not to stand on any. There were two roped off protected areas. One tourist, the first thing he did was swim to the rope, and duck under it into the protected area, so obviously the rules didn't apply to him. The boats pull up on one side of the island, this bit is very crowded and the sea a bit choppy, which could put off under-confident swimmers/ young kids struggling to master their snorkels. Walk over the spit of sand to the other side and there are even more people and more kids, but the water is far calmer and lots of people just stand in the water and don't swim, so once you're past them it's lovely and there are lots of fish - whole shoals swimming by. You can apparently hire a guide for an extra SLR 2,000 (about £10) to 'show you the reef sharks, where the turtles are', and I can imagine if he took you to different areas the snorkelling would be amazing. But the standard trip is a good way to spend a couple of hours if you're holidaying in the area - I wouldn't deliberately travel there specifically for this though.","August 15, 2018",0.0,0.0

The island is tiny, it has two tiny areas to snorkel from. In both we saw nothing but a few odd fish, -after expecting reef sharks etc. So do not get your hopes up.

Swimming is nice to see big variety of fish but at the same tiem the large ammount of corals destroyed by the anchors and turist stepping on them. They try to say that the ammount of dead coral is due to the tsunamy, but is evident it is not.

As many others have reported, the water is far too crowded to enjoy. We managed to see a couple of Black tip sharks, a green turtle and some nice tropical fish. The constant noise, splashing and banging will drive all fishes away over time I am sure. Let alone the poor coral being destroyed by careless swimmers. I experienced the bumping into other ""swimmers"" like others too. Authorities should really limit the numbers of visitors in a day if they really have Conservation in mind.

It was just getting busier and busier. There were so many people it was almost impossible to snorkel on the other side of the island.

The downside is that's the waves are a bit choppy and not suited to those who arent totally comfortable swimming, or for small children. The back side is much better for those children and others as the waves are not as choppy. I enjoyed this side more as I had a little kid with me and he really enjoyed it.","July 15, 2018",0.0,0.0

What we saw when snorkelling was a large array of tropical fish, quite a few black tip reef sharks and we were lucky enough to see a turtle too. There are two areas to snorkel in which are both quite different but both had a lot of things to see. When entering the water there is a lot of broken coral around so I would recommend bringing some form of footwear to enter the water. Unfortunately the coral around the island is totally destroyed over time but some of it is coming back but it’s still not nice to see.

Wow is the natural reaction of most first time visitors. More often than not, expect a somewhat rough boat ride since the sea is not very calm most of the year. Protect your camera gear from sea water splashes especially as you board and deboard the boat. Wear a hat or a cap, but beware of it flying off your head into the sea - mine did once!  If it happens tell the boatman. He will most likely pick it up for you. It's a delight to be in Pigeon island surrounded by crystal clear waters. This is one of the two marine national parks in Sri Lanka. The park includes the island and the sea around it teeming with colorful aquatic fauna. Beautiful reef fish, star fish, sea eel etc are abundant here. One can rent snorkeling equipment at the mainland and find an instructor to help you in the island. There are Navy divers on duty in case anyone has trouble in the water. This is a rocky mountainous island with dangerous cliffs as well. Such areas are marked with no entry signs. Please obey them, and make sure any kids in the group obey them. Having said that, make it a point to climb to the top through safe foot paths designated for that. You will be fascinated by what you can see from the top. For Photographers and nature lovers views from the top of the island are amazing. It's very windy up there most of the time. Protect yourself as well kids and elderly. At times, it feels like you are in the pathway of a small tornado!  Hold onto a tree and enjoy the scenery if you are not too sure whether you are about to fly off or not. Luckily the gusty wind is usually inward - not outward toward the ocean!  As the name of the island suggests, you are bound to see a lot of rock pigeons around - good subjects for photographers. There are quite a few butterflies, some birds and interesting lizards in this small island which is about a few acres in extent. During the season, I have seen quite a bit of land pollution. Please remember to take back everything you bring in, not to add this problem. Remember the number marked on the boat that brings you to the island. Otherwise, getting back can be an issue, unless the boatman can remember you!

Those who venture out on to the outer region do snorkel around the protected coral grounds to observe this underwater beauty.  There are people out there who rent snorkelling equipment for about Rs 250.00.  Some of the corals had been damaged during the 2004 Tsunami, but are now growing in the protected area.  There are lot of visitors too who may be unaware of the damage they cause to this pristine underground coral garden.  The many boats spewing out burnt diesel too add to this damage.

To get there you need to do the following: 1. Get to Nilaveli beach in front of the Anilana hotel. 2. Buy tickets for pigeon island as early as possible (opens at 8AM and costs $10 per person and $8 per group) 3. The people there will show you to your boat which should cost no more than 2000 LKR (can be shared with up to 6 people) 4. Your boat will have snorkeling gear on it (mask, snorkel, flippers) which costs 600 LKR a day per person. 5. Your boat will drop you off in about 15 minutes but will NOT wait for you at the island. It will be busy bringing people to and from the island the whole day. 6. Agree on a time your boat will take you back, and it will be there. Following these steps we were first to enter the water. There is an area marked by buoys which you are asked to swim outside of to preserve the beautiful reef. Within the first 50 meters I saw a shark and a turtle having breakfast! It was absolutely stunning, and the reef was very beautiful. I have diving experience in the Caribbean and this place is definitely on par. I saw a bunch of amazing fish here! After about two hours of snorkeling I left the water and went to the other side of the island which is literally 50 meters away. Here you can also swim and snorkel. I spoke to someone who saw a giant eel! The island is very hot and you are quite likely to get a sunburn or overexposed to the sun. There is some shade but take caution.

Practicalities first - get there early. As other reviews state, it gets very busy. Having read other reviews I was very wary about the destruction of the coral. However there was a big blocked off area that was diligently patrolled by guards who whistled for people to move out when they transgressed past the buoys. The guide who took us out was also very strict about not putting feet down on coral and sticking to the allowed areas. For non swimmers there is a part of the island to paddle in and look for fish in the shallow sandy waters. This was even busier than the snorkelling side. So, to the views. The water was really clear and there were literally thousands of multi variety fish. Highlights we're seeing some very large black tip reef sharks, and even a turtle. There were quite a few jellyfish, so be aware of how best to swim through them (arms still and kick slowly according to our instructor guy). If stung it's not too painful really. This was a great place to see underwater life, and a lovely spot. It does get crowded, and if you go, please heed the warnings about coral and stick to the correct areas. Arrive before 9am and your experience will be greatly enhanced. This was definitely the best place I have snorkelled, and seeing the sharks up close was amazing.","August 31, 2017",0.0,0.0

On the fish and coral side, the coral was damaged but I did get to see an abundance of beautiful fish, such as puffer fish and jellyfish. The shark side was extremely rough to navigate and would only be for experienced snorkelers and good swimmers. I did get to witness a big reef shark which was very exciting. Due to the poor clarity of the water I felt like it was just me and the shark, which was really exhilarating. I was glad to visit but am genuinely worried about the future. It was nothing like the coral I've seen in Belize and Australia and the instructions were far less rigorous. With stricter guidelines, the reef will be protected better.","August 27, 2017",0.0,0.0

Near the coast the coral is already completely destroyed. But farther out we also saw people constantly hitting the corals and standing on them. It's a matter of time before all the corals will die. Then the small fish can't live there anymore. Then medium fish can't feed anymore. Then the turtles and sharks will go away because there will be no food for them. This is basic ecosystem logic. If the organizations around pidgeon island don't start to do some serious conservation actions, then they can soon all close their businesses because there will be nothing to see underwater.

We were really shocked when we arrived. The whole island is full of people and boats. Around 11 I counted like 27 boats and probably 200-350 people. When we went into the water we realized that the reef was totally broken by all the people. Because they just walk over the corals. You don't get any briefing how to snorkel carefully. I'm wondering what they're doing with the entrance fee of around 12$ per person. It seems that it's not used to build an infrastructure and a sustainable tourism.

The coral had certainly seen better days and the water at late morning was a little murky in the deeper areas but there were lots of colourful fish and in places, some bright coral formations. I agree with previous comments about the amount of tourists (and boats!) needing to be controlled. Perhaps they should close the national park on a day or two a week and educate people on how to behave in a delicate underwater environment (follow the lead of Hanuma Bay in Hawaii). I was delighted to see turtles but the experience was somewhat tainted when a man in a large group decided to swim down and grab the turtle. Myself and one other told him loudly that this was NOT OKAY but despite this another man in the same group proceeded to swim down minutes later and did the exact same thing. I repeated my statement of how this was a national park and the animals should be left alone and merely observed (which was rather more difficult than it sounds when you're treading water and wearing a snorkel mask). When I returned to the shore I told the men at the ticket office I had witnessed 2 men handling a turtle, they just told me to tell anyone doing that not to... and thanked me when I told them I already did that. They just didn't seem that bothered which was sad but it was evidence of the general behaviour regarding the protection and maintenance of this reef. If they could put some regulations and education in as part of the trip I would  be happy to visit again, as it stands I would not return.","July 15, 2017",0.0,0.0

If you plan on going then a few musts to remember, the beach is a coral beach so take sometime to lay on, on the Island itself there are no facilities AT ALL. No toilets, apart from the sea, no sun beds, seats or any place to get water. So take what ever you need with you, make sure you take water, sun tan location, any food you want etc. The island itself is small and there are two small beaches, one where the boats all pull onto and the other side just a minutes walk away where you can snorkel. The coral reef is about 80% dead but there are some stunning fish in the sea and still signs of life on the coral. Great place to relax for a few hours to snorkel, lay in the sun and read a book. Place can get busy so go early and work on having a good half day there just to chill and relax.

The second time we visited at 1400, and stayed till 1730 - as Sujji told us, the afternoon is best for seeing the elusive turtles (and we saw 2!!). Also, the heat means that the human crush is less.

They only seem to care about the money.  Price appears to be around 3,000-3,500 rupees, depending on operator and location. This includes the national park entry ticket... However, when we went with one of the operators from Trincomalee, they did stop at Nilaveli 'for the tickets', but I didnt see any exchange happen. No briefing was given on the boat.  This is ridiuclous and explains how some of the visitors behaved and why the site looks as it does. In a national park where people are going snorkelling, good operators should be briefing their guests, a little on safety, but mostly on what NOT to do while snorkelling and visiting a national park. There were total muppets STANDING on the coral, the worst offenders for that were actually Locals, and telling them to get off the coral just resulted in oblivious stares and head bobbing. People should be reminded about using their fins correctly, and not bashing them around while bobbing vertically in the water and crashing them against the corals also, plenty of people were guilty of this. The operators allowed people to ""swim"" in life vests AND lifesaver rings.  Not ocean/pool floaties, they were actually swimming with the life saver ring from a boat around them.  Utterly ridiculous.  Those are rescue materials, not toys. People were smoking in the National Park beach arwa, and dropping their cigarette butts in the sand.  Another thing that should not be permitted in a protected area. The Government needs to step in, and they need foreign help with how to run a National Park as the Sri Lankan operators dont seem to have a clue or give a darn. The Island is quite small and you will likely be pointed to two areas, one on the opposite side from where you land - full of dead coral, mostly colourless aside from the fish, which you will see more of if you swim further out and away from others. On the same side as you land, there is a area marked with a rope, people were swimming both inside the rope amd around it - no instructions were given regarding this and no one seemed to care what anyone got up to on the island or in the water. On this near sode, there are more live corals, particularly if you swim away from where the more timid and often careless stand-on-coral people are, slightly less fish but more black-tip sharks spotted here. Overall, I enjoyed a lot of what I saw once away from most others, but it certainly isnt the most amazing snorkeling I've done, and there is a distirbing amount of dead coral which is only going to increase as no one seems to give a crap about ensuring the site is visited with care.","May 21, 2017",0.0,0.0

But they are starting to build a jetty on the island which will destroy the whole ecosystem as well as the livelihood of the many people living off of tourism to the island. The coral is already not in the best shape it's ever been in, but having this many boats coming and going to the island will truly destroy all the marine life that still exists there.","March 16, 2017",0.0,0.0

This is a tough one. We are almost as guilty as anyone else who keeps on going to this place to add to the destruction. First things first. You can get there either by a tour operator anywhere on a surrounding beach. Tickets to the park cost 2300, gear and boat depends on how you negotiate .. but you can also get all in price of 3500 (standard) and perhaps 3000 if you are good. Per person, of course. Visibility was acceptable. It is not so polluted (at least I did not see it), as some make it to be. The boats all come through a (by now) corral free corridor and land on the beach. You go snorkeling from there and walk a few meters across the island to the second spot. The first is where you will see sharks. I saw at least a dozen. Plus some other fish. Sometimes also turtles, but I did not see them. There are a few living corrals still left, but not many. Some area is behind a line and I think you are not supposed to go in there. Some corrals are still alive behind the line and the water is really shallow ... so if you are not very careful you could damage the few remaining corrals. Unfortunately, this is neither told us nor enforced or anything. So we saw many people swim in there, some literally standing up in the shallow water, probably standing on top of the corrals. This is heartbreaking and makes me very angry. And also feel guilty for fueling this industry myself. On the other side of the island, there are hardly any corrals left. You'll see more fish (and more colorful as well) ... and some big corrals that are not really that colorful ... but that is it. So not sure what the point is. I think if you want to see some more you have to swim around the island .. but since the whole trip is just 2 hours on the island, you do not have the time for that (plus, after 2 hours you cool out). So, would I do it again? No! I have seen it and I am sure there are other areas with nicer corrals that are actually preserved. The visit left me with mixed feelings. I mean, I saw sharks and lots of interesting fish .... and some live corrals ... but many dead ones, stupid people behaving like idiots and no one who cared about that. For the money the government makes here, they should protect the island much better. If you made it till here, thanks for reading I hope I was helpful to your decision making.","September 28, 2016",0.0,0.0

As it was my bf first time to snorkel we took a short crash course and learnt more about the island.  The instructor told us stories about the island and of course the dangers of the reef too - he advised us to be wary of sharks as many lived around the island. Off we go in our little boat, took a short tour of the Island and quickly got back into the sea to admire the reef. The reef was grey but was spotted with colorful fish dancing in unison with the tide. I had spotted a giant turtle and followed it to be able to touch it.  The turtle was easy to touch and did not swim away in fear, little did I know that there was a family of bow tie sharks out for their stroll.  Naturally I freaked out and looked in all directions for cover, huge fail as I had followed the turtle into open water away from the reef.  Instinctively I stayed still and let them swim past instead which I am now glad I did.  It was so magical watching them swim past - they didn't mind my ignorance and took their time.

Initially, we were turned off by the huge park entrance fees and the boat fees one has to pay to get there (a total of 6600 LKR for 2 people!) and having seen very many good snorkeling places in Malaysia, we felt this was quite over-priced. But the snorkeling in Pigeon Island is *really* quite awesome. It's not the best in the world but definitely worth the price you're paying for, and definitely the best you'll get to do in east coast Sri Lanka. (we didn't do any in the west coast, so cant comment). We saw lovely varieties of finger corals, plate coras, brain corals and sponges and were completely mesmerized with the shark and turtle sightings (got a chance to get really close to both these creatures). We saw huge schools of sergentfish, lots of butterflyfishes, trumpetfishes, crown of thorn starfish, lots of parrotfishes, travallys and boxfishes. Definitely as much variety as you get to see in some of the best snorkeling spots in the world. The sharks and turtles will completely make your day. Go there with at least 3 hours of snorkeling time in hand and do NOT return till you see them up close. Go with your own snorkeling equipment and avoid paying the unnecesary 600 bux they'll charge you for snorkeling glasses. Be friendly to the reefs - they're quite shallow in the north-western (rocky) tip of the island, and you may end up damaging some of the corals if you swim too hard. The corals here are beautiful. Protect them!","August 21, 2016",0.0,0.0

My first trip was in 2010 then 2012 and the third in 2016. I have done dives in Maldives, Australia and South Africa but this place is special. The main reason is that I don't need to go into the deep see to be amazed by the beauty of the ocean, even if I dive for 3m your guaranteed that you see the great coral reef and different fish even small sharks. I think it is best if you can have a tracker from the ticket counter or seek advice from them as to where they have seen turtles, sharks or different fish. The guys are extremely knowledgeable and always wanting to help out. The ride to the Island: - You can hire your own speed boat for as little as $20 USD, from Marble Beach (Return trip) Remeber you only pay when you come back to Marble Beach. There is no time limit so you can even spend the whole day the island. (Up to 5 guests) - Then the admission costs would be $40 or $5 USD depending whether your local or not. MUST NOTE: - There are no toilets or any other changing facilities in the Island so you need to be prepared. Deep sea diving you would need to organise it with special diving licenced boats and they will range from $40.00 - $60.00 USD depending what you want to see and how deep you want to dive.

A boatman called Ashok (office on the beach outside coral Bay hotel) took us there for Rs 3800 each, all inclusive. The boat ride lasts about ten to fifteen minutes. The island has two sides to it that permits snorkeling. The side you land on is for the more advanced swimmer or so they say. This side has clearly defined areas that one can't swim through, but you're free to snorkel everywhere else. The cordoned off area basically consists of live coral that they don't want you damaging. These areas are quite shallow and I didn't want to go in there anyway. The other areas are lovely. Teeming with fish and if you're really lucky turtles. I saw three sharks ambling about quite lazily not two feet from me. I'd definitely recommend snorkelling here. The other side of the island has a much shallower reef. Smaller fish but tons of them.

You need to get an admission ticket to enter the island and take a boat to get there. For locals, the admission ticket is about Rs. 350 and the return boat ride is Rs. 2000. The island is a very small beautiful one with a short beach and is managed by the navy. There are life guards that will guide you on which areas to snorkel. There's an area in the middle section that is protected and not allowed to enter. The rest can be viewed when you snorkel. The beach near ocean is filled with coral debris and therefore, be careful when you walk. Always wear slippers otherwise it's very difficult to walk on. The moment we entered the ocean we had corals surrounding us. Beautiful and colorful corals look really pretty. but if you want to see the best corals, go around the buoy line.That's where you'll see the turtles, reef sharks, most beautiful fish and breath taking coral gardens. If you're afraid of the deep, ask a lifeguard to take you to the deep areas. They know where turtles and sharks usually are and will make sure you don't miss them. Lifeguard did not charge a fixed amount for taking us. He told to give what we feel like giving which is better than having a high fixed amount. From the moment we got to the island till we left, we had stayed for about 3 hours. Didn't feel the time flying as it was such a mesmerizing experience. We went in mid May and there was a slight rain throughout the day and low sunlight. The corals were still visible but i think it would've looked much better if there was enough sun light.

You dont have to be a great swimmer to do this. There'll be a life guard accompanying you all the time. A very safe place with presense of police and guards all the time. They don't ripoff tourists.
