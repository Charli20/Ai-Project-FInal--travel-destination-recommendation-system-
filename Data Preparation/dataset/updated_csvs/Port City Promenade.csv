The place was full of people enjoying the cool breeze, taking pictures, playing by the water, and soaking in the peaceful nightlife. We had such a relaxing and romantic experience together. The beach swing with the “PORT CITY” sign was the best spot — simple, but it gives you that perfect calm seaside vibe. The whole atmosphere felt safe, open, and refreshing, with amazing views of the illuminated city.","October 31, 2025",0.0,0.0

No signs to the entertainment area, and you have to pay Rs. 200 one way for a shuttle that packs people in like a public bus. No receipts given, and the cashier was completely clueless—didn’t even know his own number or have paper to note anything down. Once you get to the beach area, most of the rides don’t work. Only a small roller tube for kids and canoeing. The lifeguards were on their phones and looked like they didn’t care one bit. Facilities are a joke—Rs. 300 for kids and Rs. 500 for adults to use a filthy shower, and Rs. 50 for gross toilets. Leaving was worse—we had to wait 45 minutes for a shuttle back, which was just as overcrowded. Total rip-off. Poorly run and not worth the trip. Won’t recommend. 👎 ⸻","June 1, 2025",0.0,0.0

I entered from the Plaza, which had a number of cafes and some lively music playing. Emerging on the other side, I found myself face to face with the Indian Ocean. I turned left and began to walk. In the distance, I could see the Shangri La and the One Galle Face. I think I saw a couple of adventurers enjoying kitesurfing too. It made me really happy to see the Port City was dog–friendly with a dedicated play area for dogs! But it was difficult to walk on the sand with my shoes on. So, I moved to the cycling/ walking track running parallel to the beach. The evening breeze was soothing. I spent a good half an hour walking up and down the track, abrupting at least a couple of times a prewedding photoshoot that was going on.","July 13, 2024",0.0,0.0
