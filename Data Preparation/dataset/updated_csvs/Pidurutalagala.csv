There is nothing much to see. Anyway it's the highest point in Sri Lanka. That's something !! You will be able to see some mountain ranges in Sri Lanka but nothing more than that. There is a transmission center for national tv channel, but you can't go there. It's prohibited for visitors. So not that important place to visit.","April 12, 2017",0.0,0.0

The top is disappointing as the view is marred by electricity lines everywhere and hideous rooftops! Get your pics along the way and avoid the lines!

The Military officers at the check points are very friendly & helpful. They request you not to photograph the military installation areas & we should oblige for National safety.

Not far from Nuwara eliya town,went via Udupussalawa Rd. Go early before the mist settles in. It was drizzling when we went mid morning.

If you are in Nuwara, you would be tempted to visit this place for the view. But please note. This peak is under army control. So access to the place is restricted. You are allowed access to the place - but can NOT roam around soaking in the views or take a 360degree view of the place - since the army installations there are restricting movement. Understandable from security perspective - but may not be a great thing for you - if you have limited time. The drive uphill is about 1 hour or so... You are NOT allowed to walk/trek up hill due to security reasons... Up there - there is a small tea stall which sells tea/small snacks.

Reaching the highest point after a 6km climb is not not for fun rides. Ideal for nature lovers, take warming clothes as the temperature drops rapidly. While driving, I noticed most people rush all the way up and spend sometime there and climb down the same speed. There are so much of activity going around; specially in a nature reserve. Amongst everything, what I noticed was the Wild boars were waiting for the people to feed them. PLEASE DONT FEED THE WILD ANIMALS WITH FOOD. THEY ARE A PART OF NATURE AND THIS WILL  DEGRADE THEIR ABILITY TO FIND THEIR OWN FOOD. Enjoy and be a part of the nature without altering it.","September 20, 2016",0.0,0.0

It is well worth the trip to the top but remember to take your passport as you need to be registered at a military check point part way up. There is no charge to enter!!!! The views of the surrounding area are magnificent as this is the highest point in Sri Lanka. It is best to go in the morning as the clouds close in in the afternoon. Just be careful when taking photographs and make sure your camera is pointed away from the radar and communications equipment as it is a military installation..,"September 10, 2016",0.0,0.0

You can visit this place by any type of a car or a van, ride in bikes and took tooks, prohibited since you have to drive through a sanctuary.  It will take only 45 mins to reach to the top from Nuwaraeliya. Ideal time to visit this place is in the morning session since the mountain could be totally covered in the evening and you will miss the excellent view . Contact of an Army or Airforce officer will be an advantage, otherwise officers of SL Army will not permitted to go to the highest point since its situated in a high security zone.
