And it was well worth going. The setting is lovely with a small lake nearby and mature gardens surrounding the area.  The paths to the Buddhas are nicely groomed and well looked after by the ladies tending the area. When you get to the Buddha, only then do you realise how massive it is.  Our driver said it's 15-20m and we didn't believe him.  It is 57ft which is about what he predicted! It is a very small area but it was a beautiful one to visit.","December 19, 2025",0.0,0.0

And after I did visit it, I wasn't disappointed. The carvings are huge and really impressive. Even though it's just a group of seven figures, they gave me a better feeling of something ancient and great, as Anadhaputra, and only slightly less so than Polonnaruwa. Look around for dragonflies and lizards if you like nature, and find lots of photo opportunities by the lakes on the way to/from the site.","May 4, 2015",0.0,0.0

Our driver recommended this and it is fantastic. The guide at the entrance is very well knowing and very proud of this historic site - which is to understand. We are all alone in a fantastic scenery with white butterflies and a nice walk to this temple. Presently no tourist crowds which is also nice an peaceful in a historic place.,"March 5, 2015",0.0,0.0

Accessing this place is pretty easy either using public or own transport. The narrow road that leads up there from the main road may be difficult to motor during rainy seasons (my experience was a few months back; may be the road is in better shape now). The main attraction of the site are the Buddha statues carved into a solid rock. Those carvings are nearly 1000 or more years older according to the findings. There a several statues facing different directions. The site is calm and peaceful which encourages visitors to stay there longer. If you are traveling around Wellawaya and have some time to spare, this is a place to visit.","February 11, 2015",0.0,0.0

The road goes through a bird sanctuary with lots of waterbirds and butterflies, as well as paddyfields. Very quiet. Where the road from the city meet the little road is a Buddhist museum (with a few Hindu statues as well). Absolutely worth seeing. Free entrance.

I only asked to go there because I saw a photo of the site at Rawana Falls. The road to the site is narrow, twisty and absolutely fascinating going past fields and lakes. There is a nominal entrance fee by a car park area. From there it is a short walk through trees to the temple site. It is basically a rock face surrounded by trees; the face itself has a series of huge, carved images of Buddha in relief. I understand one is the largest such on Sri Lanka being 16m tall. The exact interpretation of them is not fully understood but some are believed to be of future Buddhas. In any event they are simply beautiful and in such a peaceful setting far different in atmosphere to the more famous and busy sites elsewhere. It is well worth spending some time to get here and look around.","July 27, 2014",0.0,0.0

It is stated that this carving was in the 9th - 10th Century. The carvings have been stopped abruptly & not completed. The ceiling to protect the carving has not been completed. It is not known which King commissioned this carving. The surroundings are very beautiful & a very clean place. It is away from the hustle & bustle of town life. The boards make it easy to locate. The temple assistants are very helpful & accept donations. There is no entry ticket. I recommend visiting this place by 06.30 am if you need to take good photographs as the sun sets behind the rock in the evening & optimum results are not possible.,"May 20, 2014",0.0,0.0
