It is listed as an ""Arcaeological Protected Monument"".  Entry was free.  Open to the public every day from 0800 to 1800 hrs. At the top of the entrance archway is an inscription that reads ""ANNO 1680"". (Anno - in the year of).  However, according to our guide, it was Portugese who initially built this Fort in 1618. The Dutch, after capturing it in 1658, expanded and rebuilt the Fort to its present shape of a pentagon using Dutch architectural features.  1680 was the year when reconstruction was completed. The extent of the Fort is 62 acres. The width of the wall is 40 feet. Within the fort were an artillery, a church, Queen's palace and administrative garrisons. Most of this historic archaeological structure, together with the buildings and monuments had been destroyed during 30 years of civil war that engulfed the region. Reconstruction commenced after the end of the war.  Quite a bit of rehabilitation work had been carried out since my last visit here in 2016.  However, the many buildings, structures and monuments damaged during the war are still very much in evidence.  Restoration is in progress. The fortified wall surrounding the Fort had been built with coral stones.  Damaged areas are currently under renovation.  Surrounding these ramparts is the moat built to protect it from enemies.  On top of the ramparts is the ruined gallows used to hang prisoners. Though it was sad to see the irreparable damages caused by human conflicts, a walk along the partially rebuilt ramparts helped lessen the heaviness in my heart!

Look out for the Hangman's Tower, which was also damaged but is being restored There are some areas that you cannot take photos so keep an eye out for the signs.","August 9, 2017",0.0,0.0

Really unpleasant, not really anything of note. While I loved visiting Iaffna, tourist attractions are yet to become a big thing. They have only just started to cater for tourism and as such a lot of it is fairly naff by the rest of Sri Lanka's standards. I would definitely recommend going to Jaffna, but I suggest just walking around and taking in the city instead of trying to tick off 'must sees'.","December 14, 2016",0.0,0.0

Coated is of strategic importance for meeting the Jaffna Peninsula, on the Palk Strait that separates Sri Lanka from India. The Portuguese presence in Jaffna dates back to 1543 when the local ruler, Cankili I, kidnapped some Portuguese who had wrecked on that coast and then began to pursue his subjects on the neighboring island of Mannar recently converted Christians by St. Francis Xavier. These belonged to a lower caste of fishermen, dedicated to the harvesting of pearls, coveted item by Calicut Muslim traders who often stole them the shots. The conversion had given them the status of Portuguese nationals and the hope of military protection. The Portuguese response would only take place in 1558 when Dom Constantino de Bragança captured Jaffna, forcing Sankili into exile in Trincomalee. For its defense raised a fortification under the invocation of Our Lady of Miracles. In 1570 the Portuguese interests led Periyapulle the throne. This came to be shot down in 1582 by the son of Cankili I Puviraja Pandaram, who initiated an anti-Portuguese politics, allying the Samuri of Calicut and attacking Mannar, without success. In 1591 Portuguese forces marched on Jaffna, knocking the sovereign and replacing it with Ethirimana Cinkam, who reigned until the date of his death, 1617. The baton was handed to Arasakesari and there were three claimants to the succession: the daughter of the ruler, a group mudaliares of pro-Portuguese and Cankili II, nephew of the late. The latter promoted a coup and a palace massacre that led to power under the name Segarasasekaran VIII. To consolidate it, asked the Portuguese recognition in Colombo. Unanswered, and facing internally with Mudaliar pro-Portuguese opposition, the new ruler asked military assistance to naiaques Buccaneers Thanjavur, and allowed the Malabar buccaneers that used a base in Neduntivu, which constituted a threat to Portuguese shipping through Palk Strait. In response, in June 1619, a Portuguese joint force was sent to Jaffna. Naval forces were defeated by the Malabar buccaneers. The land, however, consisting of 5000 men under the command of Philip Oliveira, defeated the Jaffna, capturing the sovereign and leading him to Goa, where he was executed by hanging. Direct members of the royal family who survived, were deported to Goa, having been encouraged various (and even forced) to join as monks and nuns in various religious orders, as a measure to prevent future claims to the throne of that kingdom. With the execution of Segarasasekaran VIII, the line of Aryacakravarti kings who had ruled the kingdom of Jaffna for more than three centuries, was extinguished and the Portuguese began to take over directly the government. At the time, Filipe Oliveira described the inhabitants of Jaffna as ""peaceful and weak"" and his superior officer, Lanzarote de Freitas, as ""quiet, calm and without military experience."" In the following decades, there were three rebellions against the Portuguese rule, two led by Migapulle Arachchi. During this period, the Portuguese destroyed Hindu temples and all the Saraswathy Mahal library in Nallur, real repository for the entire literary output of the kingdom. Pursuant to excessive taxes the population decreased and many people moved to Ramanathapuram in India and the Vanni districts further south. The foreign trade of the ancient kingdom had a negative impact, although the elephants, the main item of exports of Jaffna, they were traded for saltpetre with various kingdoms in India and sent to Lisbon. The decline in trade hindered the payment of essential imports, which significantly reduced or ceased. According to Jesuit Father Ferdinand manuscript Queiroz (Goa, 1688), the main source of the Portuguese presence in Sri Lanka at the time, the people of Jaffna was ""reduced to extreme misery"" during the colonial era portuguesa.1 On June 22, 1658 Dutch forces under the command of Rijckloff van Goens won Jaffna without resistance. The fort was then strengthened and increased. Later, in 1795 the city was conquered by the British, remaining in their possession until 1948. Due to the civil war in Sri Lanka, the fort was the scene of clashes and sieges on several occasions. From 1986 to 1995 it was under control of the Tamil Eelam Liberation Tigers of when it was recaptured by the army of Sri Lanka after a siege of 50 days during ""Operation Riviresa"". Inside the fortress is the so-called ""Queen's House"", the embankment, police barracks and several buildings dating back to the Portuguese period.","July 24, 2015",0.0,0.0

As a lot of people have commented online, having a prearranged itinerary and driver would allow us to spend the most time travelling and the least time worrying about organising. We contacted four companies for quotes, looking for a budget option that included travel to Jaffna and a train ride and clear list of what was and wasn’t included. One response was clearly out of our price range, another looked expensive for the hotels offered (and also made some pretty elementary/lazy blunders with the itinerary) so it came down to a choice of two. We chose to travel with Miracle Sri Lanka. This was because they were the quickest to respond (we only decided we would go to Sri Lanka not much more than a week before we were to arrive), had the better price/quality equation on accommodation and because they were best at understanding the type of trip we were after. It’s a cliché, but rather than trying to squeeze us into the itinerary they preferred (and understanding that some things are always “must-sees”) we could tell they had put thought into it and worked with us on a few tweaks here and there – both before arrival and once underway. What we especially liked was that they provided a very full itinerary, there was none of those “relax at the hotel” type days that waste time and decrease the services provided by the travel agent once in-country (money for jam). The list about what activities carried additional charges was clear (and everything was our choice as to whether or not we did it) giving us an honest picture of what was included in the price what wasn’t. This busy itinerary suited us because we wanted to see as much and possible. As a result we did some pretty long days, but we always had the option of doing less and changing the itinerary along the way. The van was very spacious and new (i.e. the suspension coped well with broken roads) with excellent air conditioning. We were eager to see Jaffna, having heard that it had a different feel to other parts of Sri Lanka and was safe now following the end of the “civil” war. Due to our limited time the only way to squeeze in Jaffna was to fly there which was by way of small plane (maybe 9 seats) with limited baggage allowance - but driving is an option and would probably be 8-10 hours by car. The view over the many small farms on the approach to the airport was stunning, Sri Lanka as a whole (and Jaffna in particular) has to have some of the most consistently beautiful scenery of anywhere in the world. Not an ugly landscape to be seen. Jaffna is currently in the process of having a lot of reconstruction work which includes a new rail line. Trains have been absent from Jaffna for so long that many in the area have never seen one in person. Once the trains come, and tourists follow more easily, the area will lose some of the charm it has. There is combat damage in and around the city but to be honest with the passing of time it is becomes hard to distinguish between war ruins and buildings that have fallen into disrepair for other reasons. It was fascinating to see how the city is rebuilding itself, and there were a couple of times we spoke with families who were in the process of repairing their homes as part of the aftermath of the war. We spent two nights in Jaffna, enough time to take in Nallur Kovil, Naguleswaram Temple – where we enjoyed a nice communal vegetarian lunch. It is customary to leave your shoes outside the front door, but unfortunately our shoes got stolen here so make sure you have a bag to take your shoes in with you or do what we did for the rest of the trip and pick up a cheap local pair to use! We also visited Kantharodai Viharaya (interesting and unusual but a small site with no information available in English), Jaffna Fort (quite damaged but a good contrast with Galle), Nilavarai Well (boring) and the Elephant Point memorial (of military significance to Sri Lankans but also conveniently located on the way to Dambulla). On the whole Sri Lankan people love to have their photo taken and it was only very rarely and only in the more touristic spots that someone would stick out their hand for cash. We really enjoyed being able to wander around Jaffna market and just taking photos and seeing the fruits, vegetables and other foods stuffs that we were unfamiliar with. We also took a trip out to Point Pedro (the northern most tip of Sri Lanka) which is only of interest to the factoids among us but a real highlight was stopping in a town along the way which was commemorating a religious day with the local women gathering on the beach in colourful saris as the sun went down. A beautiful and tranquil atmosphere. We had a fairly solid couple of days, but there are also some other sites which would be worth another day or two of sightseeing or longer if you have time to settle into the local rhythm. We enjoyed Jaffna and if you have the time we think it is worth a look. The rest of our trip was excellent, albeit pretty much the same sort of route that most travellers take so no point covering again what has already been done ad infinitum. After the cultural triangle (we found the local guide “Asanka” at Anuradhapura to be genuinely exceptional and who made our visit to be something special) it was on through Kandy, Nuwara Eliya, Haputale, Ratnapura, and Bentota, before quickly back to Colombo before flying out. We could not be happier with the service provided by Miracle Sri Lanka. A driver really is only there to get you from A to B (hence “driver” rather than “guide”) but we were fortunate that our rookie driver was being trained by a more experienced driver/co-ordinator named Lahtif. Lahtif truly went above and beyond what we had any right to expect, putting in many long days, answering our endless questions on the road, patiently stopping the vehicle every time we wanted yet another photograph of a highland tea plantation, and generally ensuring that we were always happy and enjoying our trip. It was clear that he loves his country very much and loves his fellow Sri Lankans irrespective of status or religion. All the Staff at Miracle Sri Lanka gave us the personal touch and really took great care of us. My wife and I have travelled to over 140 countries combined and this type of hospitable service is a rarity. That is why we recommend Miracle Sri Lanka without hesitation. We’re sure they will grow and we hope they are able to maintain the personalised touch as they get bigger. This business philosophy built on the service we received from the company director, Ashad Wahab, whose hospitality on our arrival into Colombo at 2am really set the tone for what was to come. As budget travellers our accommodation typically met or exceeded our expectations – the places were not always centrally located (largely irrelevant with our own van) but all had something unique or special about them, whether it was a pool, a great view, or just interesting design. The only exception to this was the Amarasinghe Guest House Haputale. Now we accept most the blame for this. Miracle does not normally put its guests there but because there was so little time between when we actually confirmed the booking with Miracle and our arrival (3 days) we did not get Miracle’s first choice accommodation in Haputale. And to be honest if travelling independently we probably would have picked it anyway because Lonely Plant Sri Lanka raves about it. We have absolutely no idea why and Lonely Planet is dead wrong on this one (for this and other reasons we are starting to fall out of love with LP!). Everything about the guesthouse smacked of cheapness and penning-pinching; from the padlock on our door through to the cold shower (good water pressure though) to the food – all of which was wrapped up in a retirement village ambience. Anyhow, we’ve slept in worse and it was only for one night. We loved Sri Lanka, the friendliness, humility, sincerity and helpfulness of the people (and their beautiful smiles), the relative ease of getting around, the brilliant and delicious food (the fruit in Jaffna was peerlessly superb) – the spicier the better, the wild elephants and monitor lizards we saw along the roads, the concentration of sites spanning Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam and Christianity and the various colonial powers...and even (oddly) the maniacal private buses that storm through traffic like dinosaurs with roid-rage and make you appreciate every other vehicle on the road by comparison. Sri Lanka was one of the friendliest, welcoming and safe places that we have encountered.","March 10, 2014",0.0,0.0

Having already visited the Galle fort, we were surprised to see the almost total devastation  through active actions and neglect through the civil war.  Whilst there is active rebuilding and 'restoration' happening, from a very amateur and pedestrian view point the works going on at the moment, especially to the walls and ramparts seems to be restoring it beyond the original condition.    It has a high rating because it also indicates the tenacity of the local people to get their lives back together after almost two generations of horror.","July 20, 2013",0.0,0.0

I can understand it being a huge undertaking but so far from what I've seen I've been impressed. And there are great views of the lagoon, the Old Library and the Clock tower. The only draw back - the original fort was constructed with Coral, and with the restoration work you can see that they are using coral again - I understand that to restore an object you must stay as true to the original work as possible, but with current knowledge of erosion and destruction of the sea beds from using Coral I'm sure they could have found an alternative!....... SHOULD have found and alternative. I also wonder how true to the original structure this is...the Dutch must have old blueprints for this Fort somewhere? However its certainly worth a visit.

During the war time in Jaffna both the Sri Lankan Army and the LTTE terrorists have been using this place. During the height of the fight it is stated that some soldiers were trapped inside the fort for quite some time as the whole place was surrounded by the terrorists. However, I am not aware of what was happening there during the war time as I've never visited the Northern and Eastern areas of Sri Lanka during those dark days. From the signs of the Fort right now it can be stated that this place has been renovated and I do not like the renovations as they have not been done with a view to uphold and preserve the ancient nature of the Dutch fort. I believe that it does not represent an old Dutch fort anylonger due to the renovations. However, the fort is quite good to look at.","December 1, 2012",0.0,0.0
