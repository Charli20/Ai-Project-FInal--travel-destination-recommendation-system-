On rainy days, you can witness a massive flow of water running beneath the bridge. This stunning waterfall is also known as Kataboola Falls. The distance from Nuwara Eliya to Kadiyanlena Falls is about 46 km via the Nanuoya–Talawakelle route. However, this route can be quite challenging for cars or vans as the road is narrow and not clearly marked. If you plan to visit this beautiful waterfall, it is highly recommended to travel from Nawalapitiya via the Nawalapitiya–Kotmale Road, which is approximately 19 km. About 75% of this road is carpeted, making it suitable for cars and vans. Plan your trip carefully and explore this hidden natural wonder! #likes #like #follow #likeforlikes #love #instagram #instagood #followforfollowback #photooftheday #followme #photography #instalike #instadaily #bhfyp #likeforfollow #l #fashion #likeforlike #picoftheday #followers #beautiful","November 25, 2025",0.0,0.0

The waterfall is a three-step waterfall, two steps on the upper side of the bridge and the last part on the lower to the bridge. For your safety, do not even think to go to the third part of the waterfall, as it is extremely dangerous.","December 18, 2019",0.0,0.0

It is situated on Nawalapitiya- Talawakelle road, which is full of breathtaking sceneries. You can enjoy while driving, but be cautious of the narrow road with bends. The waterfall runs down a scenic old bridge. You can walk up to the bottom of the main fall and have a chilling experience. Just sit on the rock behind the falling waterfall and enjoy the fresh water falling just in front of you. And also you can have a relaxing bath on the second pool just below the main pool which is deep and dangerous to bathe. When you leave don't forget to climb down to the other side of the bridge if you are interested to capture some magnificent snaps of this running beauty! Definitely don't forget to take water and things to eat since there are no shops nearby. Unpolluted scenic beauty for a perfect relaxation!","June 9, 2019",0.0,0.0

Very easy to reach there by main road. It is on the Nawalapitiya - Talawakele main road and 11 km from Nawalapitiya. You can even use public transport. From Nawalapitiya, there are lot of buses are running on this road. Falls is in between the small towns Kadiyanlena and Ketambulawa. Specialty of the water fall is, the main road is passing over this river via a arch bridge. Therefore, the view from the bottom of the falls is excellent. You can go to each stage of waterfall, where the top most one has a natural pool. The second and third stages also has natural pools but they are very deep. Better not to bathe. There are shallow ponds down the river where village people are bathing. Therefore, please don't go near those deep pools. Remarkable thing is the easy access. If you want to use public transport, you can come to Nawalapitiya by bus or train. All the trains running toward Badulla, Hatton and Nanuoya stop at Nawalapitiya. Bus stand is just a 1 minute walk from the railway station. Buses to take Nawalapitiya - Talawakele. A good one day trip.","April 9, 2018",0.0,0.0
