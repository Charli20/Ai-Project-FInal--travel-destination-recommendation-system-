Constructed by King Devanampiyathissa (247-207 BC), Thuparamaya is recognised as the very first stupa constructed in Sri Lanka following the introduction of Buddhism to the island.  Thuparamaya stands as a testament to the island’s rich cultural heritage. The original stupa renovated in 1862, now features a striking bell-shaped dome.  It rises to a height of 63 feet, with a base diameter of 59 feet.  Surrounding the stupa are four concentric circles of stone pillars, believed to have once supported a conical wooden roof that sheltered the original stupa. The tops of these pillars are adorned with intricately carved lotus buds, showcasing the exceptional craftsmanship of ancient artisans. At the entrance are beautifully carved guard stones, classic examples of ancient Sri Lankan art. As is customary at all sacred Buddhist sites, we dressed modestly and removed our footwear before ascending the platform.  Visiting around 11 am, we found the granite floor quite warm underfoot, making us realize that an early morning or evening visit would have been more comfortable. Following tradition, we walked clockwise around the stupa.  The Buddhists among us, joined the crowds in offering flowers and chanting pirith (Buddhist stanzas), paying homage to the Buddha and his teachings.  The serene and tranquil atmosphere of the temple left a lasting impression on all of us. Thuparamaya is not only a site of great historical importance but also a place where visitors can experience the peaceful spirituality that defines Sri Lanka’s Buddhist heritage. I highly recommend visiting during the cooler hours of the day to fully appreciate the beauty and serenity of this ancient monument.","January 8, 2026",0.0,0.0

It was built in the time of King Devamnampiyatissa (247BC – 207BC) enshrining the collarbone relic of Gauthama Buddha which was brought to Sri Lanka by Arahat Mahinda, son of King Ashoka of India. This is believed to be the oldest Dagaba In Sri Lanka and perhaps in the whole world. It is renovated and well preserved presently. Dagaba is small in comparison to other Dagabas in Anuradhapura and its shape is different and unique. The entrance fee: 25 dollars  and get a DVD in the package.  Actually Thuparama Stupa during that time has been built using clay but several times it was renovated by various kings. It is a reputedly the oldest Dagoba in the world, Thuparama is surrounded by carefully placed pillars where the enhance make a visual appeal dramatically. We went to see this beautiful place in the morning which was great and the stone ground was still cool. Several shaped stupas can be seen in Sri Lanka like bubble shape, bell shape, heap of paddy shape and pottery shape. The Buddha Statue is covered with a vatadage (roof and pillars building) so even today it can be seen that the tall granite pillars surround the stupa. It is believed that this is the first stupa has been built in Sri Lanka. This dagoba is much different from the others, first because it isn´t that big and second because of the stone columns surrounding it. This dagoba is very sacred to Buddhists because they believe that there is the collarbone of the Buddha is found inside. A lot of locals come from all over the country. Decently and nicely dressed and most of them are clad in white.  Get some socks because the ground is very hot during the day. I have to say that this was my favorite sight in Anuradhapura as it was very different from the other places we looked around. To see this dagoba was just tantalizing as it has these pillars around it that make you think of Roman or Greek ruins instead of Asian. The pillars were used to support the roof that once spanned over the Dagoba to protect it. You have to go and see it for yourself to understand truly well. Sri Lanka first - but probably one of the oldest still Dagabas/ stupas  can be seen all over the world   and considered to be the Theravada Buddhism's most sacred place. It is not too big, but very charming and the structure of circle sanctuary (vatadage) very interesting. Don't miss it! Old Sri Lankans certainly knew how to present a building back then which is marvellous. It is also situated in a lovely green parkland area. If you're lucky, you'll have a brilliant blue sky as contrast for your photographs. Compared to Ruwanweli-saya Pagoda, the Anuradhapura stupa is much smaller. Nevertheless, I personally like this stupa and its stone pillars around. It is considered as the first stupa in Sri Lanka. We unexpectedly arrived on a Saturday and could witness and took part in those rituals. The locals wear all-white clothes to enter the place, bringing lotus and various offerings to the stupa. Don't forget, hat and shoes forbidden inside the sacred area. You will need sun protection cream, and wearing socks is very practical to avoid the pain  when trampling small stones / sand and to beat the heat if you visit during hot afternoons. The reason not just the dirty floor (these places wasn't really dirty), very often the stone very hot without shoes. The surrounding is peaceful and calm. I highly recommend you to visit. For us, this was the best visit in all the Unesco site. The columns around the Dagoba give it a unique charm and ""special"" feeling, compared with the similar looking (in style) constructions. It's nice to visit by bike. Next to this dagoba ther are the ruins of ancient temple which is worth seeing as well. I recommend you, before the visit you must read some historical fact about this place and it would help you to do an interesting the visit.","April 11, 2018",0.0,0.0

After speaking with other travelers and seeing pictures, I think Polo would have maybe been nicer. What I do find abusive is the entrance fee: 25 dollars is way too much, even if you get a DVD in the package. Most other tourists, guides, people from GHs agreed that much harm is done with these exaggerated prices and the cancellation of the combo ticket. A normal day salary in SL is 1200 rupees. One hour in a bus, is less than 100 rupees. A normal rice and curry costs around 300 - 500 rupees. How on earth can you justify 3259 rupees to pay for an entrance ticket???
