Most of the space is managed by few restaurants, which means access is Somewhat provided through their land.  If you're planning to dine or grab a drink, be prepared for steep prices — a 400ml Coke, for instance, can cost up to Rs.800, plus an additional 10% tax. It’s worth noting that these prices may feel excessive, even for international visitors, as you're essentially paying for the privilege of being on their property. I would vote Mirissa beach over this for so many reasons.","April 18, 2025",0.0,0.0

Tuc tuc driver says he needs to take up a steep hill to get there. Okay, he asked if we wanted him to wait to take us back when we got there and I could see why. We asked for 10 minutes to take photos and so glad we did not stay. From what I could see after walking through an open type cafe bar was a small rock pool with some sand and rocks to the sides. It seemed dirty and in disarray! Some old type wooden sunbeds. It seemed to be a young back packers place which is good for them but not me. Took our photos and left with our tuc tuc guy who took us to the harbour for photo there and then dropped us off at Mirissa Beach. Bit disappointed in that also with some rough and ready cafe bars along the way, but beach seemed ok. Popped into a beach bar but it was filthy.

Small private area with restaurant, tables & chairs and rammed with sunbeds. The area of water is akin to a rockpool but the swell does come through an opening catching many by surprise who occupied sunbeds close to the water's edge. I sat at a table. I read another comment stating they charged for use of a sunbed which is not the norm. The food prices are over the top as are the milkshakes & juices so I only had one coke (most I've paid for) whilst I was there. It is a unique setting for sure albeit an expensive one.

We had only encountered lovely, kind and welcoming people on our trip to Sri Lanka so it was such a shame to visit the secret beach on our last day and come across such a vile human being! The service was TERRIBLE! I was told there was no lobster so we went ahead and ordered something different. After over an hour of waiting (and asking the waiter's serval times where our food was) and seeing people that had arrived after us receive their food including multiple people receiving lobster I went and questioned the staff. One particular member who I can only explain was either drunk or on drugs said I was lying, that I hadn't asked for lobster and that I hadn't even ordered our food!! So the kitchen did not have our order! Additionally to this (and even worse!!) my friends were asked to leave the beach because they looked like 'hippys' and had a hula hoop with them, the aggressive and enraged member of staff proceeded to tell them he didn't like the way they looked and it wasn't the look they wanted for secret beach!!! This was the final straw!! We asked him what his problem was and he got in our faces and said 'you do not want a problem with me' He had enraged bloodshot eyes and was extremely volatile. It's safe to say this man is dangerous! He then went and told the tuk tuk drivers not to take us so we had to walk back to the main street! We did nothing wrong, we were laying on the beach and up to that point had not even conversed with anyone except when we placed our food order. This was all because he didn't like the way we looked! Appalling behaviour and I strongly advise you not to go there!

That being said the beach is good for snorkeling (only if you are a good swimmer and not afraid of rocks and coral).  BUT, NO MATTER WHAT DO NOT GIVE A CENT TO SECRET BEACH BAR.  See other ""terrible"" reviews.  The owner is AWFUL.  We ordered the most expensive thing on the menu, the seafood platter (which was just a waste of money) in addition to three beers, two salads and the shrimp starter.  I only mention that we ordered something expensive because I can't imagine why he would assume we were wealthy for any other reason.  First THE SERVICE IS AWFUL.  We actually thought they were friendly at first as this was our only experience with really outright rude people in Sri Lanka and we spent a month traveling around the whole country but they are just SUPER SARCASTIC AND RUDE RUDE RUDE.  The owner mentioned service was not included when we paid and while it isn't much (he only gave me change as 1000 rupees and 100) I left the 100 for the guys in the kitchen.  He proceeded to make lots of jokes about the money (my sister actually thought he was joking around at first and was shocked when she realized he wasn't) and how we were rich and MUCH MORE but that is all the energy I'm giving this dude and his place.  Seriously DON'T GO TO THE BAR, you can bring your own drinks from outside and enjoy the beach without sun beds. - beach is nice but there are plenty of just as nice and nicer beaches in Sri Lanka (go to Tangalle (my favorite beach town). - food was meh but it was the only option and we were happy to support the local business until we realized what total pieces of sh*t they were. Also, their kids play around and I let one borrow my mask and snorkel (he was very nice) but his brothers (?) friends (?) were throwing rocks (and hitting) people in the water.  I'm guessing they are learning to be jerks by example. - People mention the dogs and these are definitely more aggressive dogs than anywhere else in Sri Lanka.  And guess what?  The people that work at the beach bar kick them and throw coral, rocks and shells at them.  So yeah, they are creating a**hole dogs too.","February 2, 2019",0.0,0.0

The worst part of secret beach was when I left and was walking back to my Airbnb, a group of stray dogs attacked/chased after me. I didn’t provoke them as I was just walking like normal. Be careful when walking to and from secret beach!! The locals came and got me from the dogs and directed me towards a shortcut away from the dogs.

She came out of the sea riddled with spikes and pouring with blood. There was a small area of rock pools but a small child playing here also got sea urchins in her feet.  This was a costly ride to the hospital to have treatment to have all the spikes removed.  The locals know this, apparently it happens all the time, but there is no signs to warn you !!
