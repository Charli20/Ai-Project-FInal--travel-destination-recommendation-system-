I have seen its evolution and the renovations since 1962.  It continues to be an oasis in the centre of Colombo city and measures approximately 1000 ha.  The walking path along the perimeter is approximately 2 km in length. The park had been originally named after Queen Victoria with her statue adorning the northern entrance facing the colonial style Colombo Town (City) Hall.  A large beautiful picturesque Buddha statue has since replaced the Victoria statue.  The original Victoria statue now lies at the entrance to Laksala opposite the Southern park entrance.  The park was later renamed after the famous historical Lankan queen – Vihara Mahadevi whose statue lies adjacent to one of the prominent walking paths.  Buddha statue is a popular photographic location. This oasis in the city is well maintained with its well-manicured green gardens, trees large and small, flowers and flower beds, fountains and many walking paths.  In the centre is a little pond where ducks with colourful bills swim around with their natural grace.  On the western side of the park is the children’s section with a play-train and a large colourful playhouse with swings, staircases and slides.  Kids and adults too can enjoy a snack from the many kiosks that line the path near the playhouse.  One can hire a bicycle that you can ride along the specified cycling path.  There are many comfortable benches too - often occupied by young dreamy romantic couples. Many people come to the park in the mornings and evenings for a walk.  Near the pond are some exercise machines for aerobic exercising.  Many families visit here to relax, picnic and spend the day with the family.  Bridal groups too come here often early in the mornings for a photographic session. At the south western corner are a war memorial for those who lost their lives during the second world war and the Colombo Public Library. There are adequate public toilets within the park.  Parking is available on the roads bounding the park. I was prompted to write this article today (08/02/2020) as I found as many as 26 domesticated elephants at the southern section of the park.  They had been brought to Colombo to take part in the colourful annual festival at the nearby Gangarama Buddhist temple.  They were being fed with coconut leaves and mahouts were bathing them at a concrete lined pond.  Many people had come to witness this spectacle of elephants in the city!","February 8, 2020",0.0,0.0

I stayed at a hostel along Vauxhall Street at Slave Island and on a late afternoon I decided to walk my way to Gangaramaya Temple. From the temple, I walked across a busy road and coincidentally bumped into this green park. The park was located opposite the Municipal Town Hall. On my way, I visited the Town Hall and was lucky to be given a free map of Colombo city. I roamed around the park and found the environment calm and serene. There was a children playground, a restaurant, a magnificent Buddhist statue and few sculptures near the front entrance. It was also called Victoria Park in her early days. Compared to the Botanical Garden in Singapore, this park is not very big but it is the largest park in Colombo city. Heavy traffic jammed the roads and emitted irritating pollutants and the weather was intensely hot when I visit Colombo. I was glad to see this green oasis right in the middle of this bustling city. While there is nothing much to appreciate in the park other than the statues and children playgrounds, the park provides a short respite for travelers in a calm and serene setting. One side of the park faces the public library and the National Museum while at another corner was the street gallery exhibiting artwork. I was impressed with the colorful and bold art pieces on display. Further down from the park is the Independence Square. But I missed it because my legs were too tired to walk. It is an ordinarily park and is free. The Buddha statue is unique but the children play ground and the park itself are just ordinary.","April 18, 2019",0.0,0.0

An special account should be mentioned regarding fruit bats who are very common here. They hang up side down in their favourite trees during day time. The park is well arranged and maintained. The most eye catching structure here is the huge golden Buddha statue facing towards the Town Hall building. There is a labyrinth of water fountains which multiply the beauty of the park. There is a small lake inside the park and hanging bridge over it. You can notice several species of aquatic birds here. There is a large scale children's play ground which attract families with kids in the weekend. Entrance is free. You can enjoy comfortable environment and can even enjoy a pony ride. But there are some stray animals and be ware of them.","July 20, 2017",0.0,0.0

I was also pleasantly surprised to see many couples hugging and kissing (when i thought that was seriously restricted in this country)! There's a minor disappointment though as this park looks like a mini Taj Mahal in some of the pictures online, but in reality is far from that. Although not a fault of the park, i met a gardener who told me he has been working there for the last 25 years and he showed me his pass. I was initially convinced he is just a nice old man wanting to show me around a park that he has cared for many year. But after a good 30min, he asked for a tip. I gave him something like 300 rupees, and he blatantly asked for more. Long story short, i gave him 1000 rupees eventually... That may not be the best experience, but without him, i wouldnt have enjoyed the park as much. Overall i will give this park a 7.5/10. The points were given mainly due to the relaxing nature or it, and despite of the hot weather, there shade provided by some of the trees were really great!","July 17, 2017",0.0,0.0

It occupies a large area where boundaries are the 4 roads Sri jayawardenapura Rd (South), C.W.W. Kannnangara Mw (East), F.R Sennanayake Rd ( NorthEast), and Srimath anagarika Dharmapala Mw (North West). It was previously dedicated to the Queen Victoria and named as the Victoria Park. It is opened all year round from 8 am to 6 pm.  It is the oldest and largest park of the city of Colombo. The park is named after Queen Viharamahadevi, the mother of King Dutugamunu. King Dutigamunu was the elder son out of the two who loved the public  and fought to free Sri Lanka from the invader Elara. Princess Viharamahadevi was set off on the sea in a boat by her King father when a the sea flowed inside the land in the history as a means of requesting the relief from the problem from Gods. Previously there were fences all round the park and with the new recent renovation, they adopted a new concept such as open to any one from any side. The passers by could see things happening inside the park. With the new concept the park joins with its surroundings, the four roads being the first on each side. The tourist attractions;  Gangayamaya temple, Beire lake, Seema Maalaka Floating Temple  and the Galle Face Green are not too far away from the park. The important tourists attractions are also nearby across the adjoining road to the South are; Nelumpokuna   / Art Gallery side/ National Museum;and  on the North  side is the Town Hall. On its Western end locates the Cenotaph War Memorial, Colombo and the Colombo Public Library. During the British rule era of Sri Lanka the park was built on a land donated to the Colombo city by Charles Henry de Soysa, and named it then as ""Victoria Park"" after the Queen Victoria, During World War II, it was occupied by the British Army with Australian 17th Brigade based at Victoria Park. After the war the park was restored and open to the public in 1951. The park has a huge Buddha statue and a series of water fountains. It also includes a mini zoo, a children's play area and a BAC Jet Provost. The park is maintained by the Colombo Municipal Council. The Vihara Maha Devi Park has an Open Air Stadium which is a venue for concerts and public events. However, it is cooler during the day due to the shades of the trees. Most uses of the park are the couples, families, some groups, and some school children who visit Colombo on their annual trips which is a must do activity in the first term itself. The park cleaners /, the police with a police vehicle (3 in number when I went in) are seen in the park. Police allow the couples on their own maintaining privacy and sometimes police send them  off them if they do not behave well. At the South beside the Sri Jayawardenepura Rd,a large parking area is located and even big buses could be stop there. Across the road on the South, there are display of arts of paintings for selling beside the road. When walked into the park through the Town Hall end, you can see the long square pools of water in the center, the aquarium on the far left end, the lake, suspension bridge, candy floss and pony rides on the far right, and the World War memorial at the western end. Viharamahadevi park has come a long with improvements since the 1990's. There are a lot of the old high trees that give a welcomed shade. This gives a little wild look but the park is meticulously maintained, with the beautiful paved pathways, some flanked by palm trees and lush, even grass on the ground. There are some surprising little seating structures in the park, sleek and pleasant, mostly made of wood and concrete.The most popular attraction at the park is the lake and the woody suspension bridge above it. The kids and sometimes adults get the enjoyment from walking on it and peering down at the lake below. Children really like to spend time in the park as there is plenty of play-spaces. Children's activities are found in the children's corner. Therefore the park is best suited for the families and the couples. Recently the little hills is  landscaped inside the park. Blue and purple paved pathways roll on top of the hills, and some parts of the hills are carved with tunnels through which kids  get enjoyment by crawling.  Around these mini-hills are      mat-slides, swings and the whole works. Nearby it, there  is a big plastic play-house for younger kids, and the huge blue circle on the ground that turns into a watery play-zone for children with sprinklers operative  at 5 pm. Ponies are caged in an open square fenced with wood around this area. They carry kids on their backs or dragging small carriages of children, for a charge. Candy floss are sold at at Viharamahadevi Park, right next to the kids' play-house. Ice cream truck guy is also found there selling them. Aquarium is located to the East side of the park.  There are a many types of little fishes, some of them are beautiful, a tiny little lobster and two baby turtles. Entry to the aquarium is charged.One bathroom is near the aquarium and others in different locations. Very nice park with authentic plants and trees. The gardener could make for you an excursion, There is a big spot for huge bats, that are hanging on the trees. It's an amazing park in the heart of Colombo. It takes away the rush of the city and can relax peacefully. People do their morning exercise here and do jogging along the jogging tracks, as government promote people to do exercises/ jogging in order to maintain health and to keep fit.","March 19, 2017",0.0,0.0

But, without anything just sitting down under a tree and watching my daughter playing is what I like.... entrance from the town hall side is bit non- crowd place and can find a space for us... Go.. spend some hours here... you will feel it... A treasure in Busy Colombo...","March 14, 2017",0.0,0.0

The park is impressive and provided a leisurely walk taking in a local fruit juice and homemade cakes at a friendly clean cafe. The theatre was easy to find and we returned that evening for the show. Be sure to find and marvel at the fruit bats, flying foxes, filling the tree tops along one of the paths. A most impressive sight especially if like us this is your first sighting! The evening walk was along a well lit path and very safe. The show was amazing, a brilliant fusion of acrobatic circus and traditional Sri Lankan dance and costume. We only realised how clever later in our travels having attended the cultural show at Kandy. Although in comparison, Cirque Lanka seems expensive, it really is well worth the money, we were absorbed in the lively performance throughout. The standard is high. We chose to sit on chairs but to save money you can opt for the stone seating in the open air auditorium. Finally the cast are friendly, radiate pride in their show and pleased to chat. Coffee and commemorative tee shirts are available to buy, as with any brilliantly organised show! Suitable for all ages, we are a young retired couple.","February 9, 2017",0.0,0.0

There are no Tree Preservation Orders, given that fact some of the trees are hundreds of years old. You will see native trees, Mahogany, cloves.....it really is a great place for the locals to sit and relax in a very tranquil setting, which is effectively is in the heart of the city. It was the local childrens' last day at school and so it was just lovely to watch them playing the way we used to.....a trip down memory lane. Tour over and the 'head gardener' asked for a tip.  We gave him a tip so he could go on his way but then he demanded 5,000 Rupees......yes 5,000 Rupees.  He didn't ask once, nor twice but countless times to my husband, then me and then both of us.  In fact he got so close to me, I could smell alcohol.....My husband told him to leave us alone; that the tip was sufficient but 5,000 was a joke. Then coming out of the park, my husband met a guy with a bag slung over his shoulder - it was a cobra that he took out and said 'nice snake' until it bit at him and he put it away.

Personally though, this park is memorable not for the park itself but for this ""Town Hall"" building which looks ""somewhat"" like the White House in Washington (the alikeness applies to just the two ""width sides"" of the building though, so I wouldn't call it a replica of the White House, and also this building has a dome above unlike the White House) just across the road from the Park on the northeast side (where the reflecting pool is). Nearby, just about a 15-minute walk north from this park are Colombo's two famous temples, namely Seema Malaka on the green Beira Lake and Gangaramaya with its ""unique & creative"" display of rows of Buddhas (each one higher than the one in front like spectators' stands in a stadium); also about a 15-minute walk but to the west from the park is the Kollupitiya Junction roundabout on Galle Rd. running parallel (and very close) to the seaside with Galle Face Green (a ""lively"" seaside promenade with vendors selling food & drinks lined up along one side) another 10 to 15 minutes from the roundabout after a right turn onto Galle Rd..

Not many years ago, it was a breeding ground for small drug peddlers and prostitutes in the evenings and unless one really wanted to take a short cut to the other side, it was not a journey a person would like to take, especially after dark. However, it has been transformed to its old glory and better, I think, because there are dedicated areas for activity, a children's play area with water spouts and exercise points and beautifully paved walkways and a jogging and cycling track.  The brainchild of this transformation was Mr. Gotabhaya Rajapakse,  former Sec. of Defence, who, under the auspices of the Urban Development Authority, commenced a 'Make Colombo clean and beautiful' campaign, a reality.  It is patrolled by police and so well lit and used by hundreds, that safety is not an issue any more.

As usual , the place may be a little crowded during the weekends. If you want to jog and if you staying closer to the park , I think this is a good place.","May 22, 2015",0.0,0.0

Best time to visit is between 3 to 6 pm when there's good weather and low sunlight or during early morning. It has attractions like separate playing area for kids, a small lake, bridge, joggers area and cycling area. Be prepared to take out atleast 2-3 hours for visiting the whole park and also the endurance to walk around this beautiful  5-6km stretch.","May 19, 2015",0.0,0.0

Good for walks early mornings and evenings. In the afternoons obviously the sun takes over and it can get quite hot. however the many trees with luxuriant shade are in abundance so there is hope! Great place to go sit  and enjoy some restful time enjoying the greenery. Kids have a little play zone too. There are some water features as well for the adventurous who want to play in the water (if allowed). A good location for photoshoots AND for some great tree shots when the light is good. During Cherry Blossom season even better. the park is full of Cherry Blossoms!,"May 18, 2015",0.0,0.0
