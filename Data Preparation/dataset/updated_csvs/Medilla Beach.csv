It is so beautiful and relaxing, there's a lovely selection of places to eat and drink when you walk down the beach with hammocks and great settings. The only downside to this beach is that you can't swim in the water, we saw a few people try but it made the restaurant owners very nervous and they went to have a word with them after running out with the live saver ring.","March 15, 2016",0.0,0.0

But tangalle, in total ,was a disappointment .. Beach is clean and beautiful only to look from distant..  Despite of many tourists, we didn't see anyone going in the water, we too were only on the shores with loads of small crabs due to ferocious waves  .. I couldn't enjoy it as much as i do when we go to a beach destination ,due to rough sea.. In month of December,  you can easily strike this off from your todo , without hesitation..","February 1, 2016",0.0,0.0

This is not as happening as the Mirissa beach but it is quite a nice place that anyone should not miss. There are many beach hottels available around and the Tangalle lagoon is also situated near Madilla beach. I usually some here to get away from dress I deal in Colombo. It is relaxing to lay down one a Sun bed or swing in a hammock with a nice icedtea in the day time or to have a Mojito in the evening while you enjoying the sea breeze. Just like in Bentota, Madilla also is the pics to experience a beautiful sunsets. If you wake up little early in the morning you get to see thousands of parrots in this area starting their day.","October 19, 2015",0.0,0.0

There was no waste on the beach and in the sea! The more you go to the west (to Tangalle), the more waste you can find on the beach, but it's still not dirty there. Most hotels are hidden behind palms and therefore the beach looks natural, there are no big hotel complexes. The sea is not for swimming because of the waves and more important because of the rocks, but it's possible to go into the water for cooling. We haven't been alone at the beach, but it was far from beeing crowded! You have enough space at the beach!","February 16, 2015",0.0,0.0

However, it was quite windy, and the waves made it impossible to swim (but quite fun to play in the waves). There are many restaurants along the beach, but the quality varies.. Find a good one and stick to that (like Ibis, Chance Lanka, Zanzibar). The closer you walk to the town Tangalle, the more stray dogs you'll see, and many of them have scabies, or are hurt in one way or the other.
