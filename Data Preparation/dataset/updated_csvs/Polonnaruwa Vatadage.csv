One of the major archaeological sites, Polonnaruwa, Sri Lanka has many monuments located close to each other in the palace complex which sound almost similar. The moon stone at the entrance is intricately carved and is clearly visible even after all these centuries. The buddha statues still retain their radiance even after almost a thousand years.

Many people rush through Polonnaruwa and completely miss this spot, but it’s honestly one of the most beautiful ruins I’ve seen. It’s a circular stone shrine over 800 years old, with beautiful carvings, stone steps, and small Buddha statues around the center. The craftsmanship is incredible, and you can feel how important and sacred this place was in ancient times. One important thing to know: you can’t go inside with shoes or slippers, so definitely bring a pair of socks if you want to explore it comfortably! The stone floor can be hot under the sun. I love how peaceful it felt. Even with other tourists around, there’s something calming about walking slowly around the circle, admiring the carvings and imagining what it looked like centuries ago. If you love history, architecture, or just discovering hidden gems, don’t skip the Vatadage when you visit Polonnaruwa! Tip: Go early morning or late afternoon for the best light and fewer crowds.","July 8, 2025",0.0,0.0

Polonnaruwa is one of the ancient capitals. A few secular and religious structures remain here, but all but a few of them are scattered over a large area, so it is possible to move on foot, but early in the morning, then the sun bakes mercilessly. Most visitors travel by tuk-tuk and bike, although I have seen buses. The ticket office is located next to the museum and it is a few kilometers from the entrance. Ticket $30, you can map, give a paper site map in English, well of course, if you need a guide asked. There are Russian speakers who need to.

It's a stunning place built originally to house the Buddha Tooth Relic that now rests in Kandy. It has a main entrance with an ornate moonstone and once inside that there is a second upper level with four evenly spaced entrances each facing North, Siuth, Eas and West with a Buddha statue facing you. It would have had a giant roof which has not survived and under that was the stupa that housed the relic. It's hard to believe that excavations only began in 1903 given its age but the statues are amazingly well preserved and/or restored. The four Buddha's are striking and the ornate staircase and supplementary statuary are awesome. We stayed for quite a while here entranced by the beauty of the place. Completely mesmerising.

Great remains of several temples and other buildings are found here. To get into most of them you need to take shoes off and cover up appropriately. There are custodians that will remind you if you forget. This is a beautiful perfect stupa which has its charm. It is even more remarkable to know that the Tooth Relic was once kept here. There are 2 places like these in Sri Lanka .and they are Polonnaruwa and Meditigiriya. Most beautiful Vatadage is found in Medirigiriya. ‘Vatadage’ means Circular house for the tooth. It is one of the many ancient monuments in Polonnaruwa, excellent craftsmanship are observed at the statues and the carvings all around this site.  This is one of the most wonderful architecture of the ancient civilization. It is definitely a place that every visitor has to visit. Although an inscription records says, this beautiful stupa house has been built before the time of the King Nissanka Nalla, he has carried out major renovations on this building. The uniqueness of such buildings is that the stupa is protected by a roof.  On the centre there is a small stupa and on the four sides, there are beautiful carved Lord Buddha statues. These statues are different as normally they are found with the curly hair and here, a  snot is visible on the head and the robe is also flat which is unusual.  The roof has been supported by two rows of stone pillars around the stupa though none of them are visible today. However, the pillars outside the walls are still intact. Four sets of beautifully carved stone stairs lead to the upper levels from four sides. on the sides of stair case some of the most beautiful guard stones and moon stones are seen in this here an tradition of its era. The guard stone of the eastern side of the temple are said to be the best guard stone in the Polonnaruwa era. There are rotunda shape freaky dwarf figures for the protection of these buildings. Located in the southeast is the Quadrangle or ""Dalada Maluwa"" decorated with elaborate stone carvings Here you will see a very good example of a Moon Stone and some excellent releif work the entrance to the central Dagaba accessible without removing shoes. If hot and sunny, bring some socks as the stone floor will burn your feet. Otherwise it is a great place to visit. This whole site is incredible and a wonder of the ancient world. Touring the whole site in a day is the best way to see the places and even better if you have a good guide that can explain everything.

No need to worry about having your bike nicked (stolen) no one has chains to lock their bikes and nobody within the World Heritage Site will nick your bike either! There is lots to see.
