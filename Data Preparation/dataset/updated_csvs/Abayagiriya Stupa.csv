This is different.,4,Solo,"This review is about Jetavanarama stupa, Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka. This review is NOT about Abhayagiriya Stupa, Anuradhapura which looks similar. There are a number of ancient Buddhist stupas in the holy city of Anuradhapura. Built around 300 AD, the Jetavanarama stupa was about 400 ft high in the earlier times. In was also one of the seven wonders of the ancient old. Due perhaps disputes between various sects of Buddhist Religious Orders in the ancient times, the stupa was levelled up and then reconstructed to its present height of about 300 ft. A place is calm and the atmosphere is peaceful. There is also Buddhist shrine inside the campus. With many entrances/exits, I got lost and had to circle the outer ring road a few times before my car driver/guide located me. It is suggested that suitable sign boards / direction boards could be placed at the entrances for the foreigners who are not familiar with the stupa.

The site is incredibly historic, dating back to the 1st century BC, and once formed part of a massive monastery complex that housed thousands of monks. Despite its age, the stupa still carries a sense of sacred silence that’s deeply moving. One charming (and slightly surprising) part of the visit was the number of monkeys roaming freely around the grounds! They added a playful, authentic touch to the experience — definitely part of the charm. Just behind the main stupa, we discovered Eth Pokuna (also known as the Elephant Pond). This ancient, circular pond was once used by the monks for bathing and ritual purposes. It’s beautifully preserved and surrounded by nature — a perfect place for quiet reflection. If you love history, spiritual places, and meaningful travel, this site is a must-visit while exploring Anuradhapura. Wear respectful clothing, take your time, and soak in the peaceful energy of this sacred place.","June 24, 2025",0.0,38.095238095238095,13.553113553113553,1.8315018315018317,14.285714285714285

This ancient stupa, one of the largest in the world, stands as a monumental reminder of Sri Lanka’s rich Buddhist heritage and the incredible engineering feats of the ancient Sinhalese civilization. Historical Significance Jethawanaramaya was constructed by King Mahasena in the 3rd century AD, and its original height is said to have reached over 120 meters, making it one of the tallest man-made structures of its time. It was built on the site where Mahinda Thera, the monk who introduced Buddhism to Sri Lanka, resided. When I share these details with visitors, they often express surprise at how advanced the ancient Sri Lankan civilization was, particularly in terms of construction and religious devotion. Architectural Marvel The sheer scale of the stupa is what usually leaves visitors speechless. Built entirely of bricks, it is said that over 93 million bricks were used to complete this towering structure. The stupendous size of Jethawanaramaya is not just a display of religious devotion but also a testament to the architectural brilliance of ancient Sri Lanka. As I guide guests around the stupa, I like to highlight the craftsmanship of the brickwork and the symmetry of the structure, which are still well-preserved despite being centuries old. Spiritual Atmosphere Beyond its architectural grandeur, Jethawanaramaya offers a peaceful and spiritual ambiance. The site is often filled with pilgrims, making offerings and chanting prayers, which enhances the sacred atmosphere. I always encourage my guests to take a moment to absorb the tranquility of the surroundings, as it offers a deeper connection to the spiritual history of the place. For many, the quiet reflection at the base of the stupa becomes a cherished moment in their journey through Sri Lanka. *","September 17, 2024",0.0,38.095238095238095,13.553113553113553,1.8315018315018317,14.285714285714285

It stands 70m high but was once 50m higher than that making it the third largest building in the world, behind only two of the Giza Pyramids in Egypt. You'll have to take off your shoes and have knees and shoulders covered but socks are okay and necessary as the paving slabs can be red hot.

To think that this 'building' pre-dates Christianity puts it, to my mind, alongside the pyramids in Egypt. OK there is not a great deal to do here except wander round but it is truly amazing. Additionally we were treated to the company of several coachloads of Sri Lankan children visiting at the same time as us. They were delightful and seemed to be fascinated by our fair skins and hair ( our driver suspected that they had come from remote village schools and not familiar with Westerners) and wanted to be photographed with us. This was a worthwhile visit for us. I would also like to put an alternative viewpoint to those posters who complain about the cost of entry to Anuradapura. The cost at around 3500 rupees is under UK£20, less than you would pay for a decent evening meal and this is for the whole city site which I doubt could be visited in full in one whole day. It is an historic site of world importance which housed an amazingly sophisticated civilisation pre-dating the birth of Christ. That it is not better known is surprising. As for the fact that locals pay a lesser entry fee (and this applies to sites throughout Sri Lanka and in some shops and restaurants too), I grant that this is an unusual arrangement but I personally do not begrudge them.

It was about a two hour drive from Sigiriya.  The area is too big to cover on foot in a single day and, whilst bicycles and TukTuks are easy and cheap to hire, I would recommend a driver/guide who can direct you to and provide commentary on the most significant sites. The four main stupas (Jethawanaramaya/Jethavanarama, Rutwanwelisaya, Thuparama and Abhayaagiri) are all different.  You won’t need more than 10-15 minutes at each unless you want to stay to worship, We don’t think there is any entrance charge – we weren’t asked for any money and there were no ticket checks. As for all temples, you must dress respectfully (legs and shoulders covered). You need to remove hats and shoes but you can wear socks which I would recommend as the stones underfoot can be hot and sharp. Of the four main stupas, we liked Jethawanaramaya/Jethavanarama the best.  At 400ft high with a 370ft diameter base on a 670ft square rock base, this is the largest stupa in Anuradpura  and one of the tallest brick structures in the world.  It was built in the 3rd century. The dome is unpainted. It was very quiet and tranquil. Once part of a huge monastery and you can see the ruins all around.  It is worth visiting the museum where you can see a good collection of guardstones and ancient jewellery.  There is a clean toilet here too. Rutwanwelisaya has a massive white painted dome. It is 180ft (used to be twice that).  It is surrounded by wall with over 300 elephant sculptures but almost all these are restored or replacements.  It can get busy with devotees coming to pray. Thuparama is the smallest and oldest of the main stupas in Anuradhapura (what you see is mainly reconstructed).  Its significance is that it is said to enshrine the collarbone of the Buddha and as such there are lots of pilgrims actively worshipping. A white dome surrounded by stone pillars which used to support a wooden cover.
