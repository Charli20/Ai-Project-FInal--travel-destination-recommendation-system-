We only had time to explore a small portion, perhaps two or three acres, but were captivated by its beauty. The gardens are world-renowned for their extensive collection of over 4,000 plant species, including a magnificent orchid house, spices, medicinal plants, and imposing palm avenues. A unique feature is the tradition of visiting dignitaries planting memorial trees; one notable example is the Ceylon ironwood tree planted by Tsar Nicholas II of Russia during his visit in 1891.","November 4, 2025",0.0,0.0

The gardens are huge and beautifully maintained, with over 4,000 plant species from around the world. My favourites were the colourful Orchid House, the impressive avenue of Royal Palms, and the massive Javan fig tree which is truly a wonder to see. It’s a very calm and relaxing place, with plenty of benches to sit and take in the scenery. You can easily spend 2–3 hours wandering here.

This was followed by King Kirti Sri and King Rajadhi Rajasinghe. A temple was built on this location by King Wimala Dharma, but it was destroyed by the British when they were given control over the Kingdom of Kandy.[citation needed] Thereafter, the groundwork for a botanical garden was formed by Alexandar Moon in 1821. He used the garden for coffee and cinnamon plants.[4] The Botanical Garden at Peradeniya was formally established in 1843 with plants brought from Kew Garden, Slave Island, Colombo, and the Kalutara Garden in Kalutara. The Royal Botanic Garden, Peradeniya was made more independent and expanded under George Gardner as superintendent in 1844. On Gardner's death in 1849 George Henry Kendrick Thwaites became superintendent. He served until he resigned in 1879, when he was succeeded by Henry Trimen, who served until 1895.[5][6] He was succeeded in turn by John Christopher Willis who served as director from 1898 until 1912. The garden came under the administration of the Department of Agriculture when it was established in 1912. There are avenues in the River Drive such as Cook's Pine Avenue, Palmyra Palm Avenue, Double Coconut Avenue, Cabbage Palm Avenue, and Royal Palm Avenue.[7] The classical Avenue of Palms is in this Garden. One item with a significant history is the Cannonball Tree planted by King George V of the United Kingdom and Queen Mary in 1901. It is often load with fruit, which are thought to resemble cannonballs. During World War II, the Botanic Garden was used by Lord Louis Mountbatten, the supreme commander of the allied forces in the South Asia, as the headquarters of the South East Asia Command. The gardens were used as a location in the 1957 film The Bridge on the River Kwai. The origins of the botanical garden date back to 1371, when King Wickramabahu III ascended the throne and held court in Peradeniya near the Mahaweli River. He was succeeded by King Kirti Sri and King Rajadhi Rajasinghe. King Wimala Dharma built a temple on this site, but it was destroyed by the British when they gained control of the kingdom of Kandy. Afterwards Alexandar Moon laid the foundation stone for a botanical garden in 1821. He used the garden for coffee and cinnamon plants.[4] The Peradeniya Botanical Garden was officially established in 1843 with plants from Kew Garden, Slave Island, Colombo and Kalutara Garden in Kalutara.  The Royal Botanic Garden of Peradeniya became more independent and expanded under George Gardner as head in 1844. After Gardner's death in 1849, George Henry Kendrick became Thwaite's head. He served until his resignation in 1879, after which Henry Trimen succeeded him, who remained in office until 1895.[5][6] He was succeeded by John Christopher Willis, who served as director from 1898 to 1912. The garden came under the administration of the Ministry of Agriculture when it was founded in 1912. Along River Drive, there are avenues such as Cook's Pine Avenue, Palmyra Palm Avenue, Double Coconut Avenue, Cabbage Palm Avenue, and Royal Palm Avenue.[7] This garden is also home to the classic Palm Avenue.  One object with significant history is the cannonball tree planted in 1901 by King George V of the United Kingdom and Queen Mary. It is often loaded with fruits thought to resemble cannonballs.

The gardens are vast, beautifully maintained, and offer a perfect blend of natural beauty and tranquility. Walking through the towering palm avenues, orchid house, and spice gardens was a relaxing and enriching experience. The sheer variety of flora was impressive, and the kids especially enjoyed the giant bamboo and the massive Javan fig tree. The weather in April was warm but pleasant, and there were plenty of shaded areas to rest. We packed some snacks and had a lovely little picnic on the grass. It’s also a great spot for photography—every corner has something unique to offer. Highly recommend this place for families, nature lovers, or anyone looking to spend a peaceful day outdoors.

The roads/paths aren’t marked on the map, and there’s no indication of the location of the flora featured on the pages adjacent to the map.  Some plants are labeled; most are not.  And the labels are pretty useless.  A large plot of dahlias, for example, are simply described as dahlias, no indication of the specific cross or the name of each plant.  It’s even worse in the orchid house, where the labels that would indicate the cross of the orchids, even the species name, are neatly hidden, and visitors are specifically admonished not to touch the plant labels.

The highlight was the fruit bats which were amazing, spread over the left side of the park and in their thousands. The orchids were beautiful and the trees in the arboretum spectacular, huge buttress roots lianas.  We had cold drinks at a kiosk  and coffee in the cafe, buffet lunch was available. All was good with the exception of 2 gardeners who begged for money. We went on to the 3 temples loop, a nice change to go to sites with only a few other tourists and worth the time.","February 7, 2019",0.0,0.0

We were contemplating just having a rest day round the pool at the hotel but decided to make the journey here and we were SO glad we did. Other places should look to this place as an example of a well thought out, maintained and looked after urban green space. It contains a bewildering variety of plants and trees, giant fruit bats hanging from and flying between the trees, monkeys you can get right up close to, lakes, and an orchid house with some of the most amazing flowers. There is a cafe / buffet restaurant in the park, but this would make a lovely place to bring a picnic. If you appreciate and enjoy nature and green spaces then this is a must visit if staying in or near Kandy. It is approx. 15 mins from Kandy city to here by tuk tuk and the fare should cost about 5 GBP.

You can easily spend 2-3 hours just walking around if you want to cover all the spots. The map is very accurate and will help you plan your walk around. If you're looking to go onto the rope bridge, you will have to wait as they do not allow more than 5 people at a time, on the bridge. We were pretty excited about it but gave it a miss after seeing the queue for it. It's a favorite among the locals and you'll see a whole lot of kids, couples, families coming in for picnics, strolls and spending some quiet time. Would absolutely recommend comfortable footwear.

The gardens are beautiful, very well kept and lots of different areas. The orchid house is amazing. There was so many different things to see, it took us about three hours to walk round, facilities good, have a lovely lunch in the pavilion. Also there is a suspension bridge which is worth going over. I would highly recommend a trip here for any nature lovers.","September 15, 2018",0.0,0.0

Having seen some in India, like the one at Ooty, it is gigantic by comparison. It is exceptionally well kept and cared for. From the enterence to exit , the area is well marked and has excellent species of plants. Do check for timings from local contacts before going. Evenings or early morning are the best time to go.","September 12, 2018",0.0,0.0
