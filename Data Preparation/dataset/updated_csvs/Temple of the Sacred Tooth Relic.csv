We’re from the USA, and this was our first time visiting such an important Buddhist site, so it felt very special. The temple is beautiful and calm, and you can really sense how much it means to the local people. We went during a prayer time, which was interesting to see and helped us understand the culture better. The atmosphere was peaceful and respectful. Even if you’re not religious, it’s a great place to learn about Sri Lanka’s history and traditions. Just remember to dress modestly and remove your shoes before entering.

Just as Christians believe in the miraculous power of the nails used to nail Christ, the pieces of the cross itself, the veil of Veronica, etc., Buddhists believe in the power of the fragments of Buddha. To complicate matters, legend has it that the Buddha's body was cremated, so the main relics are teeth and bones. Buddhist eschatology says that all Buddha's relics will one day gather at the Bodhi tree where he attained enlightenment and then form his body. Well, do you remember Spielberg's Terminator, which comes from little droplets? The tooth in Kandy has a long history of travel both in South Asia and in Sri Lanka. Buddhists stole it, then brought it back, Catholics stole it to burn it in Goa, turned out to burn a copy. This alone could make a thriller that's millennia long. It was last attacked by the Tamil Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, who are known to be Hindus. But the tooth remained intact every time. The actual way he is, the units can say. It's almost never shown to anyone. It's kept in 7 gold boxes, nested one in the other. I'd like to believe the idea was ripped from our mother. The keys to the boxes are kept by the abbots of different monasteries. And this is an old Soviet detective's plot, Maria Medici's Lodge, about Qatari treasures.  The entrance to the temple through the Great Gate is Maha Vahalkada.  You have to pay 2,000 rupees for admission, locals are free. It's acceptable. Locals buy lotus flowers at the entrance, which you most likely do not need as a Buddhist. You need to take your shoes off at the entrance. No matter who you are. To the right of the gate is an octagon-shaped sandstone tower. There is a library of Buddhist texts written on palm sheets. All the presidents of Sri Lanka, once elected, give a speech from there. Behind the gate is a two-story building, on the second floor of which is a cherished tooth. There is a queue of people who want to lay lotuses bought at the entrance. If you don't wait in line for a lotus, the whole visit takes half an hour.","November 24, 2025",0.0,0.0

It is a holiday today so lots of locals and school children but we did not feel overwhelmed at any point. Like other Temples we had to remove shoes/caps and cover arms and shoulders and men need trousers. Our guide advised us to give the shoe attendants 100 rupees as a way of thanks if we wanted to. I would suggest getting small local notes as it is polite to give to toilet attendants at public toilet sites. (Box outside). I tried to order currency before we left UK but everywhere said 7/10 days. I got mine from natwest online in 2 days. I did find the ground very hot to walk on and noticed some locals kept their socks on, might be worthwhile later in the day as the ground heats up.  Temple very holy and spiritual.

The teachings of the Buddha were transmitted by word of mouth passing his canine tooth. The relic holds immense spiritual and political significance; historically, it was believed that whoever possessed the tooth had the right to govern the country. The temple attracts thousands of pilgrims and tourists daily. Its importance to Buddhists is often likened to that of Mecca or the Vatican.

It is believed that the tooth of Lord Buddha was taken out from the burning funeral pyre of Lord Buddha by a monk. It is believed that the sacred tooth of Lord Buddha was  taken to Sri Lanka by the members of the royalty of Kalinga kingdom. The temple is very well maintained, clean and serene. The Kandy drums are a joy to listen to. Like other monuments in Sri Lanka, there are no directions/sign boards indicating the entrance / exit routes. The timings of the darshan are not displayed either at the temple premises or on the tickets. For unknown reasons, the doors of the sanctum sanctorum was closed @19.50 Hrs. even though my  guide/driver indicated that the puja is finished only @20.00 Hrs. The shoe stand just before the entrance ticket counter is crowded and too small for the number of foreigners visiting the temple. The crowd management security staff of the temple could be more polite and smiling. Perhaps, a  month long sensitizing training on hospitality management could change the rather hostile attitude of the temple staff. For some strange reasons only Sri Lankan currency / cash was acceptable at the ticket counter and it took a full 15 minutes to get the tickets issued. Too many visitors, too few cash counters.

There are various shops nearby selling clothes or material to cover up, but be careful. A friendly old man took us to a shop, tried to get us to buy an expensive sarong, but we left with a very reasonable piece of material. My partner tipped the man for being kind. The man then walked back to the temple with us and started pointing things out and telling us the history. We thought he was just being nice and was grateful for the tip. At the end, we were going to give him some more money anyway, but he demanded $30 each from us! We didn’t ask for a tour, and didn’t actually want one. It was so awkward and left a bit of a sour taste in our mouths. We paid him some money, but not what he demanded. When we left another nicely dressed man approached us, making conversation, but turned out to be trying to get us to buy something or go on some tour.

The next day at the Temple they were ""resting"" after the procession, surrounded by crowds in the heat, many of them still swaying in distress.

The architecture is beautiful, with intricate carvings, golden interiors, and a quiet reverence that surrounds you. After the visit, I had the incredible opportunity to get close to a temple elephant — and even touched it!

Admission is expensive in relation to what is offered, and the famous “tooth” is not even visible. The complex is overcrowded, exploited by tourists and seems more like a source of income than a spiritual place. If you don’t have a religious affiliation, you can save yourself a visit – there are much more impressive sights in Sri Lanka. I came to Kandy, full of courage, they said: “The temple – it’s good!” But what received me there, oh hurt – was more souvenir stand than Holy Jewel. The “sacred tooth”? Not even to see You can count admission for that. A little incense, a lot of people, and selfies instead of the devotional loot. Spiritually, there was not much only business with tourist destination. My conclusion, in rhyme and brevity: The temple brings toothache rather than spice.

Attending the Esala Perahera, which lasts 10 days between late July and August on dates that vary depending on the full moon, can be a unique experience.

Unfortunately, the reality was completely different - there were workers/security guards in the temple who chased and pushed us from place to place, without one being able to see the temple properly. The room with the box with the Buddha's tooth opens only for 10 minutes, you have to stand in line for at least half an hour, in which everyone squeezes and finally the workers push you around the open room again, shouting at you ""go, go, quick"". In addition, there was a monk standing in front of the box with the relic, so the box was almost invisible. The whole thing was a big stress and rush, you can't really talk about the sacred atmosphere that should be there. We felt like we were being herded like cattle on pasture, and the security guards were even touching people while driving them, which is way over the line.

Stepping into the temple grounds is akin to entering a realm of serenity and reverence, where the intricate architecture and ornate decor beautifully showcase the deep-rooted traditions of Sri Lanka. The palpable aura of spirituality within the temple is truly awe-inspiring, and the opportunity to witness the revered relic is a humbling experience. The daily rituals and ceremonies offer a glimpse into the island's religious customs, adding depth to the visit. While the temple is a must-visit attraction, the crowds can be overwhelming during peak hours. Navigating through the throngs of visitors may detract slightly from the overall serenity of the place. To fully appreciate the tranquility of the temple, consider visiting during early morning or late afternoon hours when the crowds are thinner. Engage with the knowledgeable guides available on-site to gain deeper insights into the history and significance of the relic. Make sure to explore the surrounding gardens and shrines within the temple complex for a holistic experience. Don't miss the opportunity to witness the evening 'Pooja' ceremony, where the relic is paraded through the temple grounds amidst traditional music and rituals. In conclusion, a visit to the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic in Kandy is a cultural escapade that promises to leave a lasting impression on your soul.

It is required of women to wear dresses that do not show upper arms and upper legs. There is security check at the entrance and counters for shoes to be kept safe . The police woman was kind enough to show me how to wrap my scarf over my arms instead of criticising me ( as one would in India). Inside the temple , there was the drums beat going on with prayers. Lots of families along with tourists thronged the place and there was security manning the crowds unlike any other Buddhist temple we visited in srilanka. The queue to see the inner chamber where the casket with the tooth relic is preserved was half n hour long and we were asked if we wanted to wait. After the wait we got a two second glimpse of the jewel studded casket. The whole experience reminded us of the darshan at Thirupathi temple in India. The stunning visual is worth waiting for and the pictures displayed on the screen though same ,does not do justice to the real thing. Go prepared to wait in the queue and it’s worth it.

On the mentioned date, my wife was denied entry into the temple by the security personnel at the entry security scanning gate to Sri Dalada Maligawa. The reason provided was her attire – specifically, wearing of a “Hijab” (not Burkha as mentioned in website) which is similar to the head coverings of the Christian Nuns. This action was not only humiliating but also seemed to be in direct opposition to the Buddhist ideology of respect for all religions, which the temple is known to uphold. The exclusion based on religious attire is a matter of serious concern, as it directly impacts the fundamental rights of individuals to practice their religion and the values of respect and tolerance. It is imperative that the temple authorities address this issue promptly to ensure that the sacred space remains accessible and welcoming to all devotees, irrespective of their religious expressions. I’ve already requested in writing to the temple authorities to investigate this matter and take appropriate measures to prevent such incidents in the future maintaining respect the diverse backgrounds of visitors and to uphold the temple's commitment to religious harmony. Also, if “Hijab” which is similar to covering head like Nuns prohibited to entry then should mention clearly in websites publicly.

Siddhartha Gautama Shakyamuni (aka Gautama Buddha) is a key figure in Buddhism: he is a spiritual teacher and the founder of Buddhism, one of the three world religions. Alas, as with all such personalities, there is little reliable information about the biography of the Buddha: a number of Buddhist sutras (texts) in Pali and several Sanskrit scriptures: “Buddacharita”, “Lalitavistara” and others. What is interesting is that when Buddha, at the age of 80, made the “Great Transition into the Absolute Peace of Nirvana,” his body was cremated in accordance with the rite for the Universal Ruler. But then all sorts of Epic Fails begin on the topic of “dividing the relics of the deceased.” If you believe the legends, the remains of the Buddha were divided into eight parts and lie at the base of specially erected stupas-suburgans - these are Buddhist architectural and sculptural religious structures of a hemispherical shape. So, when the relics of Buddha were being divided, someone cunning managed to steal the left fang of the deceased, which was taken to Ceylon. They say that Princess Hemamala and Prince Dantha from the city of Kalinga in India were involved in this action, and this happened during the reign of King Kirti Sri Meghavarna (sometime around 301-328 AD). In Ceylon, the TOOTH was declared a shrine and from that moment the history of the future Temple of the Sacred Relic of the Tooth Relic of Gautama Buddha, the Temple of the Tooth Relic, Sri Dalada Maligawa began!!! All these are names of the same religious building. And not just another Buddhist stupa, but one of the main and most revered shrines of the island!!! In Christianity, this question (I’m talking about sacred relics) is somehow more solid, or something: the Shroud of Turin, the Crown of Thorns, the Spear of Longinus, the Title INRI, the Holy Grail, nails (with which the body of Jesus was nailed to the Cross), and finally the pincers with which they took out those very nails... And then a TOOTH... A whole temple was built over it!!! The same existing Sri Dalada Maligawa in the city of Kandy, the capital of the Central Province of Sri Lanka. Like any shrine, from ancient times this TOOTH was attributed with a certain magical power - whoever owned the fang of the Buddha also had all the power. It is clear that under this “sauce” the Buddha tooth became the property of the ruling Sri Lankan royal dynasty. The fate of the TOOTH was turbulent: it was always kept in the temple at the royal residence, and since the capital “moved” several times (Anuradapura, Pollonnaruwa, Dambadeniya, Yapahuwa, Kurunegala, Kotte Gampola), the TOOTH “traveled” after it. Until he arrived in Kandy at the end of the 16th century. The first “Dalada Madura” (or “Dalada Mandira”, depending on how you write) to store the holy relic (I’m talking about the ZUB, of course) was built during the reign of King Vimaladharmasuriya I in 1592-1604. Alas, during the colonization of the island by the Portuguese, the temple was destroyed. The second sacral was erected on the same site during the reign of King Rajasinghe II from 1635 to 1687. Apparently, Temple of the Tooth was fatally unlucky - and this iconic building was burned, though now by the Dutch. In 1687, King Vimaladharmasuriya II built another Dalada Madura, and it had three floors!!! However, over time, the building fell into disrepair and was destroyed. And finally, his son, King Sri Vera Parakrama Narendrasinghe, who reigned from 1707 to 1739, built the current Dalada Maligawa, which, with minor architectural “adjustments” by subsequent rulers, has survived to this day. The architecture of the sacral is executed in a unique Kandyan style in combination with details and elements of the style of “Dalada Madura” - the forerunner sanctuaries, which previously housed the relic of the Sacred Tooth Relic of Buddha. The location chosen for the temple was simply magical: next to the ancient Royal Palace (the latter is located north of the temple) and a forest reserve called Udavatha Kelaya (to the east). The aura of this magnificent place is brightened by the famous Kandy Lake - the so-called Sea of Milk (also known as Bogambara and Kiri Mukhuda). I was probably lucky - there were practically no people (maybe it was just not the season), I refused the services of a guide - everything that interested me, I read on the internet the day before. I can’t say that I was deeply impressed by what I saw, but I recommend a visit to Sri Dalada Maligawa, if only because it is one of the most famous religious sites on the island.","March 18, 2024",0.0,0.0

Look out: In front of the main building there are many people who want to be your guide and tourists are guided to leave there shoes with some guard.

Not to mention that the place is a maze and it took me and my boyfriend some time to get to the entrance that we needed. Different prices for locals and for tourists are present also here, as everywhere else at Sri Lanka. The ceremony is a mass activity where a lot of people pushes themselves to a certain place at the temple, and you push yourself to get there also, since you don't know why are others pushing themselves so much. The fact it, the religious people want to give their offerings to the temple and to Buddha. You will end up in a room where everyone is packed, waiting to get to the room for offerings, where you won't get. So since you know about this now, you don't need to push yourself together with them and I have just saved you some time and nerves. Instead of pushing yourself with the mass, I recommend you to walk around the temple and the parts that are accessible for the visitors, and e.g. burn some candles as your offering outside. The place looks magical, especially in the evening when it's already dark outside. To burn something, you need to buy a special oil for that. I didn't figure out where to do that, unfortunately. What got me was a payment payment machine looking as an ATM that could be used for donations for the temple. Like wow. A way to go, The Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic!

This temple is a must visit for every Buddhist. The tooth relic was originally housed in a rock carved temple in Anuradha pura before it was moved to the present palace / temple at Kandy about five hundred years ago. This centuries old temple is serene and the worshippers pray in silence. The temple was originally built as a royal residential palace by the royal family of Sri Lanka long time ago. The remarkable features of this temple is the renowned recital of Kandy drums is a joy to hear. The musical performance is unique for Sri Lanka.The musical instruments are two drums and a pipe instrument. The performance lasting about half an hour is precisely choreographed. The puja timings are fixed  lasting about half an hour three times in a day - morning, noon and evening. The temple premises are very well secured and spotless maintenance is visible everywhere. You need to be properly dressed to enter the temple. Ensure that your shoulder and knees are covered. The temple management treats every body equal. No preference seems to be given for any one. There is no shouting at or pushing of the pilgrims in the sanctum sanctorium. Everything is done in dignified silence. The temple is a must visit while you are in Kandy, Sri Lanka.

We hired a guide & got there around 5.45pm- just in time for us to enter the central premises & visit other shrines. Guide helped us navigate & explained the different parts of the temple in details. Some tips for fellow travellers- 1. The tooth relic is not for public viewing everyday- only taken our during ceremony. Instead we get to see the golden caskets holding the relic from 6.45pm in the evening. So get there on the right time! 2. Several shrines are present inside temple premises, like Crystal budhha, Hari Krishna, original manuscripts, museum & royal elephant memorial. Taking a guide is best to navigate & not miss out key sights. 3. Golden Canopy above the relic is not to be missed- stunning sight in the evening light! 4. Moonstone entrances, beautiful paintings & carvings- despite the rush, take sometime to admire the place. 5. There are some ground rules for taking photographs- No selfies, no photos showing back to the Buddha statues, etc. So be mindful of them, while enjoying the temple. Entry fee for SAARC members is 1500 SLR per person. Ticket counter is next to the temple on side of the lake.

I was conscious of how tourists can be intrusive in such a sacred place but I felt a warm welcome as people guided us around or patiently let us past. It really was a lovely evening visit.

They don't show the actual tooth to the public anymore, maybe once a decade according to the guidebook. If you go here don't expect to we wow'ed by the tooth. I enjoyed the Buddhism history museum (included in the ticket) and the light during dusk outside. I found it interesting just to observe the local absolute devotion to a relic, real or not, (no offence intended) and the ceremony going on where you can glimpse the inner shrine for a moment. It is also interesting to walk through the museum of the tooth relic and read the signs inside the new shrine. It will cost you 2000 rupees to go inside + some tip to the shoe guy. Remember to cover your knees and shoulders (both men and women).

We rejected as we wanted to see firstly how we can enter. Of course this was not true we were able to enter without the blanket too. (However these local guys followed us till the entrance). This is annoying. When we entered we felt that our visit is very limited. Every second moment there was an instruction like “not going there, that part is closed”ecc. we were unable to see the garden :( The worst experience was at the end because they asked money for keeping our shoes (we had no problem of course taking off our shoes, I have problem about the paying).

There are two queues to get in: one for the men and one for the women. Like most things in life, the men's line moved faster. This is mainly due to two things: 1) most women carry bags that need searching (most men don't) 2) the women perhaps face a little more scrutiny over what they can wear and must cover-up. Shoulders and legs need to be covered, so make sure you have a light scarf and sarong. Men too should carry a sarong to put on although some western males it seemed were managing to get through in shorts. Once inside make sure you follow the tourist crowds to the right and enter the temple through the tourist entry. Here you leave your shoes, you will be expected to tip after collection. Inside, at prayer, this place is busy. At times you are moved along with the crowd. The locals are of course queuing to leave gifts and to pray so don't feel too bad if you 'skip' queues and glide past those locals waiting on the stairs. The relic itself can't be seen. Instead, you can peer into the golden shrine where it is stored, but at this point in the temple, the crowds are at their busiest so you main only manage a cursory glance. The best part about the temple is exploring the grounds and additional rooms and buildings. The carvings and sculptures of Budha are beautiful, and in most spaces, you can take photos. Just be mindful of people worshipping and not to take pictures with your back to any Budha statue. The grounds of the temple are beautiful, and there is an elephant on the site too, which is used in ceremonies. Although, it is clearly an old elephant and seeing it so heavily chained doesn't make for the best view. At night time, around the temple and Lake, there is a cacophony of noise as bats and birds come to roost in their hundreds. It is the most spectacular site in Kandy and a must-see.

Firstly we hadn't dressed appropriately so had to rent sarongs to cover up. The guy was nice enough but still 400rs down. It's a bit of a faff to get in, we went through one lot if security then you get your bag checked again before you go in. We had a tip off from the sarong guy that they take away your cigarettes and lighters so I hid them well in the bag. You have to put your shoes in a shoe storage area. Other reviews are correct about them asking for a donation, I was aware of this and just played deaf when they asked me, I had to assist my child... Oh and don't think you can put your shoes in your bag - that's not allowed! The ticket machines don't give change so you do have to have the right amount on you. There was an attendant who said we didn't have to pay for the children which was good and we didn't have the right change but he helped a guy behind us which then gave us the right change. So that was kind. First off you walk on boiling hot pavement in bear feet. Then I guess the rest is interesting if you like architecture and religious history. As atheists we were a little bemused by all of it. There's nothing to tell you where the tooth is. We assumed we were in the right place by the people praying on the floor... But there's no signs etc and we didn't have a guide. There's a museum which was a little interesting. The saddest part is the taxidermied elephant. Poor thing was captured and kept for a good 50years before he died. He's now stuffed in a glass cabinet. There's a photo timeline of his life since capture but it doesn't have any translation so we don't really know the story... If you like this sort if thing and are in Kandy then maybe pay it a visit... But I definitely wouldn't drive to Kandy for a day trip just for that.

I don't think the experience would have been the same without this personal insight and informed commentary. Firstly, to be clear you do not see the sacred tooth! If you are lucky you may get a quick peek at the casket (with its separate 5 locks) where it is housed.  If you are a tourist you can reach this by one very quick queue where Buddhists who wish to leave an offering may queue for 3 hours to reach the relic.  The feeling of reference and respect is overwhelming and moving, just close your eyes for a moment and take in the sounds of chanting and drumming, the smells of essence and offerings, the emotions shown by people of faith.  I can honestly say I felt completely overcome and still shiver at the memory. On leaving this area there is plenty more to see which are less crowded and easier to view.  We particularly enjoyed the room with the pictures outlining the history of the sacred tooth around a statue of Buddha with another place for offerings a must do place in Kandy, particularly if you can have an insight as to why it is so important to the people of Sri Lanka","February 18, 2020",0.0,0.0

Give the impression the machines actually returns cash by asking how many tickets one wants. If the visitor pays you the right amount of money (1000 + 500), too bad! Wait for the next one. But if the visitor pays you more, do both NOT return the difference and if applicable sell more tickets than expected. Congratulations, you just scammed a foreign visitor! But you create a very bad image for yourself indeed...","January 26, 2020",0.0,0.0
