Hence a very special place for Buddhists. It is located on large Granti blocks, by a lake, ie just the landscape is a dream. You don't meet tourists here, just faithful locals. A real highlight is a large lying Buddha and a sitting one carved into the rocks. A true hidden champion when UNESCO highlights are nearby","September 25, 2025",0.0,0.0

It's best to go either early in the morning (around 7:00 AM) or late in the afternoon (after 4:00 PM) to avoid the intense heat that can make exploring difficult between 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM. Allocate about 1 to 2 hours for your visit, as there's plenty to see. Be sure to study the site map (found in one of my uploaded photos) and plan your visit accordingly. Leave the museum and the ""Budhu Madura"" for last, as these shaded areas can be enjoyed regardless of the heat.","February 23, 2025",0.0,0.0

I visited after about 8years. Thanthirimale Raja Maha Vihara  is in the Anuradhapura District. It is located approximately 40 km north west of the Anuradhapura city. Once upon a time this area was fully covered with jungle and an elephant country. Untill recently this temple was rarely visited due to the 30 years of civil war, difficult roads and elephants. This place was unidentified till the beginning of the 19th century, and in the 1960s the temple was re-established by Buddhist monks. The temple and surrounding area are full of ruins, including two stone statues and several stone ponds. There is an archaeological museum at Thanthirimale. This temple, which was built in the third century BC has a historical value. When the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi was brought from India to Sri Lanka, one night along the way to Anuradhapura, the pot containing the sapling was kept at Thanthirimale. It is believed that there was one branch separately grew from the pot, was planted at that village to remember the incident. Hence, some believe that this may be the first Sri Maha Bhodi plant in Sri Lanka. The Bo Tree is placed on top of large stony layer which has protected the tree up to now.","October 11, 2019",0.0,0.0
