About a 5.2 KM hike with a mountain to climb at the end. Path is paved until the end, after which you can climb up a short mountain. View is nice. Few concerns with increased local tourism, looks like need for some crowd control is there – saw plastic bottles thrown all over the place even on some tree tops. Started to the hike around 11:45 AM and came back around 2 PM. Coming down met lot of unruly visitors under the influence of liquor, playing drums and singing. Some of them looked like too drunk to climb. Sorry to see nature getting destroyed by “monkeys” who do not know how to behave and where they are. No government or authorities seen – and I can see this natural wonder in knuckles getting split very soon. I would suggest avoiding weekends if you really want to enjoy the nature.","April 22, 2018",0.0,0.0

It lies adjacent to the famous Knuckles Mountain Range and can be accessed via Matale or the Dambulla - Bakamoona road. The road gets narrow and winding when you start climbing up. The sudden elevation in altitude brings you to a completely different climatic habitat and a mountainous terrain with plenty of fresh and cool air. The plains takes you to the edge of a cliff with a sudden and drastic drop at its distal end, somewhat similar to what travellers encounter at the famous ""World's End"" (""lokanthaya"") at the Horton Plains, but on a lesser scale. The drop is aptly named ""little world's end"" ('Punchi Lokanthaya'). You could park the vehicles at the start of the plains and could follow a marked trail along the terrain to its edge. Depending on the weather and mountain mist, visibility could be limited. It takes about 20 minutes to reach the egde (need to be careful) and the scenary would be simply breath-taking. After coming back to the vehicles, you could also continue with further upward journey to reach the summit of the mountain range. However, vehicles are not allowed in the last 3 Km (2 mile) distance of the road hence you have to negotiate the distance on foot. The climb would take another 45 minutes which could be a bit tiring. At the top, there is a telecommunication tower rising a further couple of hundred feet and a station complex transmitting mobile phone and railway communication signals. You could exchange a few pleasentaries with the staff manning the complex as they  yearn for company! At this point, the summit stands at 4,800 feet above mean sea level and you feel as if you are standing ""on top of the world""  with almost all the other mountain peaks dwarfing  beneath you. There is just one adjoining mountain peak rising a further 200 feet with a foot path to its top. For the more adventurous types, it would be worth the trouble to scale it. And for us, after our trek down to the vehicles and then half way on to our descent, we stopped by a mountain stream used by many hikers to have a bath. The cool dip was very refreshing and enjoyable after the tiresome trek. You could also have meals by the side of the stream, but please do not litter. For the more enthusiastic traveller, you could book a mountain lodge through the forest department and spend the night in the plains enjoying the unique stillness and the beauty of the mounternous wilderness.","January 26, 2015",0.0,0.0
