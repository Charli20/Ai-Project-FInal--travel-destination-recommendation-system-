Some good water slides were not functioning due to lack of staff, ( not broken, since I have used it same day morning ) Most of the water slides are broken Most of relaxing chairs are broken, the first chair I get on was broken, I have explained that to the staff but they refused to belive that saying that machine says its working, that chair left me a backache since its broken, archad ares staff need more training, they should know in and out of every machine there but they don't, i think they have never played any of those games or have experienced what they sell, I suggest a staff workshop they can too enjoy and learn about there product which will improve the service quality. HR manager can improve the service I guess. But staff was frendy, not badmouthing, they just need proper technical training. Food are wayyyyy overpriced, but its the normal for parks here. Don't just buy dry area tickets since there not much to do, arcade is not that good. Don't buy full premium packaged, most of the slides and machines are not working, Just buy normal water package and buy anything not included separately. When you use slingshot slide ( which need 2 people ) be carefully of the person you go with, if that person is not decipinarry enough, you can get hurt. ( but it's the best slide ) and when you comes down keep your legs inside rubber tube, that is not instructed but don't trust the person you go with anyway. Overall good experience, hope it gets better in future.","January 21, 2024",0.0,0.0

This is the first time I'm coming to the Water Park. So this is for those 1st timers. * The water section opens at 11am and closes at 4.30pm and NOT 9am to 5pm. * Certain rides such as Wave Pool were only at 3pm. Call and ask so you can plan ahead. * Call ahead to find out if a ride not operational to avoid frowns from the kids. * Food and drinks are not allowed from outside. Have to be purchased from the food court inside. It's a decent place with even a ladies only pool.

It is a huge place with lots of activities for all. The place was over crowded and staff were rude and disrespectful, I think may be trying to control the crowd. It is important to carry the entrance ticket with you, as it is needed to enter the entertainment areas, unfortunately which no one told us at the entrance. Lots of activities for everyone, but strange rules in some areas, where they have limit to children under 10,  where my 11 year old were not allowed to play. Unfortunately he couldn't participate in other water play, as they were too adventurous for him. Staff were not flexible.

Like many things in Sri Lanka it appears that no maintenance or renovation has been done since it opened. There were some guys painting one of the bridges but it appears to be too little too late. Broken steps, weeds coming through the pavement.  Squalid , smelly changing rooms with broken toilet doors. There is actually a sign in the toilet area requesting people ""do not vomit in sinks""!!! Possibly because people have in the past due to the smell??? In the kids pool there is a tyre to swing on that is rusted and has sharp edges. The lazy river does not work so is just still. The wave pool only produces waves for half an hour a day. Many people seemed to be enjoying the place possibly because it's all sri lanka has and they have no idea about the shockingly low standards compared to waterparks in other countries. Seriously management..sort it out! It could be fantastic if it was renovated and well maintained.

Got tickets for water park only. Since he's too young for other stuff. They charge tickets based on kids height. So it was 1500 for the kid. Yet there were some rides he was not allowed to do. As we had to accompany him we couldn't enjoy much either. So think twice if you wanna visit with young kids. Also always seek safety instructions prior to ride anything. I had one ride with no instructions and got my feet hurt. Don't rely on food inside food court to Serve you great food. Out of all we enjoyed 9D cinema as they call it.,"May 3, 2017",0.0,0.0

Some rides are not functioning. I can see many places where accidents could take place. Safety measures they have taken are very minimal. Staff operate the rides do not advise on how to act when they go on the ride. Perhaps they cannot tell this to thousand odd people who'd come. Therefore they can always print and give at the entrance or display near each ride. Also in the water park for some rides you do not have to wear nylon swim wear but for some rides it's required. That's totally understandable but some stupid people do not get it. Therefore it's better to make it compulsory in the water park and clearly mention this so staff will not have to get abused by some morons who do not understand this.another thing is the equipments you need for the water rides is not enough and not proper mechanism to distribute . Therefore people gather around in the end of the ride to grab these. They won't wait till the person finishes the ride and they just stay at the end. It's so lot safe and annoying as hell. Park should have a way to get these to the top so people do not have to fight for it. This way everybody gets the chance.

This time though, we tried almost all the rides and while the rides itself were much fun for a 6 year old, and us, we found the rides to be poorly maintained.  We heard a crashing sound at one ride and turned around to see a rusted piece fall off! In addition, most of the stairs leading up to the rides as well as the surrounding areas and specially the toilets and changing rooms were very dirty and terribly maintained. My husband, at the end of one ride, stepped on something hard in the pool and fished out a chicken bone! Gross! Also beware that if you are a foreigner the management tries to bully you into buying swimwear from their shop! When we first went in we were told that proper swimwear would be required, which was not a problem for us as we all had good swim wear bought at speciality swim shops in Colombo. We didn't have any problems at any of the rides or the baby pool area. The staff at the baby pool area even felt my swimsuit, which was a two piece with a short sleeved rash guard and accompanying tights and checked it off as proper swimwear. At the wave pool thought, at the end of the day, at 3.00 pm, staff at the entrance refused to let me into the pool claiming that I was not wearing proper swimwear. One even went on to say that the material was that of proper swimwear but since it 'looked' like a t-shirt (which all rashguards obviously do to some extent!!) I would not be allowed in! This came as a shock as for the whole day I had had no problems, and had in fact seen Sri Lankans in attire ranging from tops made from crepe-like material going on the rides, to long flowing black gown like dresses! I went to the front desk to complain and was told that what I was wearing was not a swimsuit as all swim wear obviously have cupping at the front! Which I assume means built in bras? The manager then proceeded to show me to the swim wear shop on the premises and told me that what was available there was what they considered swim wear! When I insisted that I was in fact wearing a Arena brand swimwear bought from an extremely reputable Swim shop in Colombo, the manager told me that if I wanted to argue with him he could very well argue with me also, and quite rudely told me that I needed to educate myself on what real swim wear was! When I mentioned that his staff at rides other rides had not had a problem he told me to go and raise the issue with them. Which makes me wonder what the whole point of having a manager was! We met quite a few other foreigners who had the same problem as we did, with the staff at the wave pool insisting their rash guards were not proper attire for swimming, while there were local Sri Lankan men in track bottoms and what not in the same pool we were being barred from 😡 Staff at the dry park were also not very well trained with ticket sales staff selling tickets for my three year old (our 2nd daughter) for rides but staff at the ride entrances telling us that she would not be allowed on the rides. Which led to a whole lot of tears from my daughter, and us having to trudge back to the counter to get refunds for tickets. All in all, it was a very disappointing end to a fun day. The place needs a lot of maintenance and upkeep effort, as well as a change in management and staff attitudes for the place to go from mediocre to good. The potential is there though!","January 4, 2017",0.0,0.0

Amazing place in Sri Lanka for water fun and machine rides. At present it is the only theme park upto the standards, in Sri Lanka. Enjoyed very well. We had a very warm welcome right from the car park, and the receptionist and people in the ticket counter were very friendly. We enjoyed well, especially the kids. The 3D cinema experience was unbeatable! There were few things that the Management should take care of to improve the customer satisfaction. 1. Seats in some machines were untidy, rusty, broken and the belts were not intact, tied together or so. Better to give clear instructions to people before operating the machines. Lack of maintenance and carelessness may result in disaster one day! 2. We went in the afternoon and disappointed in some stations where the operators didn't come forward to help. They looked tired and were non-responsive. We thought of going back home. A female operator finally helped us. Thanks for her. The attitude of others made us extremely uncomfortable. They were chatting together and when we approached them to operate the machines , a male operator told to another one as ""I can't help them"" which was clearly audible to us. This kind of behaviour will hurt the visitors. Sorry to say this. Leaving the bitter moments apart, this place is ideal for Kids and Families to enjoy. Strongly suggest it. Better to go early, by 0900 Hrs in the morning, so that you can enjoy well. You will need atleast 3 hours to have the maximum fun. The wave pool opens at 1500 Hrs and closes at 1530 Hrs.

Staff at the ticket counter (especially the lady in the saree -sorry can't remember your name)you were good. Good customer service given to my parents who were elderly and only visited the place to  spend time with their grand children. You changed their ticket  from package A as they weren't using any facilities on the premises and were merely observers which  enabled them to be part of the kids day!!! Thanks so much!!! I was disappointed  to find the entrance ticket didn't allow any  parent who are not elderly  to enter the wet area  unless they purchased at least package A which I find a steep price  of thousand rupees. Although we didn't mind I really felt for the parents who couldn't afford for the whole family to attend the wet rides. I feel as observers they should be allowed to accompany their kids around the whole park  as there are sufficient staff at each ride site to check the bands which indicate who is allowed to use the rides so I don't see why the restriction for wet rides section? Wet area is covered with a ridiculous fence and gate which restricts parents overseeing their kids safety not to mention to share their happiness unless they also purchase package A. One parent actually asked us to call their child as they couldn't see them. I really felt for them as they were glued against the fence trying to get a glimpse of their child and  couldn't afford to pay an additional price to get into that area. The large lockers didn't have padlocks so if you take a backpack or a large bag you can't store anything securely. There were tiny lockers only to keep a very small bag. Toilets were gross not cleaned at all, I found better toilets in rural areas in SL! There is also steep steps up and down  the park , not suitable for people with disabilities. I saw a wheelchair user accessing the wet area through the gate but waited a long time for someone to let them in and out. The whole park is on various levels accessed via steps. Very steep landscape making difficult to move a WC. Please note the facilities doesn't allow a disabled person to take part in any activity. I didn't see any hoists of any sort or ramps to access rides. They can only be observers. I found the rides to be old equipment and to be honest there are better rides at your local fun fair. Seen as this is the only adventure park in SL my two nieces living in SL had a good time. My son loved the water park which he always looks forward to on holidays and are located on site of the hotels we choose. SL really need hotels with water rides to attract more families as this location is a bit of a journey from Colombo. All in all if you are living abroad you have better places than this however if you are at a loose end with kids on holiday maybe worth the journey. I feel it's not worth the hassle to travel that far. Note to Customer Service - please review your package deals for families with young children. Please allow parents to access all areas as observers with a Entrance Ticket so that they can accompany their kids. You have ample staffing to check arm bands on children before they gets on the rides which would enable parents to be closer to their kids.","August 15, 2016",0.0,0.0

Honestly speaking it wasn’t a wonderful, at least a pleasant experience at all. The place is hacked! The machines haven’t been maintained properly for a very long time.  They were horribly noisy, the safety belts were broken and never been fixed.  The changing rooms plus the washrooms were terrible! Smelly, filthy and didn’t have proper lighting and ventilation. Going inside these washrooms was definitely a thrill ride for us.  Just the sight of the toilets, which were hardly been washed, can make you throw up. Disgusting! The water area was the only amusement in this park. It was vast with different activities and our kid finally started to have a good time. But here we go again! Even if there were strict regulations on the pool attire, neither visitors nor the staff seemed to have concerns on the rules. Some ladies were in the pool wearing shalwars, denims even saris and jewelry! There were definitely doubts on hygiene of these pools. Even though we wanted to escape the place as soon as possible, we decided to try more dry rides since we paid nearly Rs. 2000 per person. But it was hilarious to find out many rides were closed probably for lunch or something. Who knows! Anyhow, the staff was lethargic, cold and unhelpful. So we gave up and left the place. This place could have been an amazing amusement park with a better management, regular maintenance, and a friendlier staff.  But with the lack of all these things and especially the cleanliness, this is just a total rip off.  It’s sad that we don’t have any other amusement parks and the only one we have is a disaster! I will not even consider going back there again.","April 25, 2016",0.0,0.0

Information about the rides and how to get to them needs to be more clear and precise as I hardly understood what she spoke for almost 10 minutes. The staff gave a negative impression of their roles and showed dislike towards their job at Leisure World. Not a single employee took an effort to make the visitors comfortable and  to give a pleasant experience of their day spent at the park. The water park changing rooms, both male and female were very very filthy. People just rinse their clothes on the floor. It was more or less like a mud water park. Most of the lockers were unlockers!!!! The bathrooms were in an extremely bad shape. The water park was good and I loved the rides. The downside was that the rides were not maintained properly. Everything was rusty and felt like they will collapse any minute. The rest of the park is not that great. All the other rides on dry land are not maintained properly and there is a big question mark regarding health and safety. No attention was given towards safety and people just enjoy like cats and dogs least bothered about their safety as well as others. The management should think of new and innovative methods to attract more people and make good use of the huge land area of the location. After all any visitor would be willing to even pay more and get a better experience. People should be made aware of safety and also there has to be some plan to maintain the park and to keep all areas clean. If I am to visit again I would definitely use the water area only.","March 21, 2016",0.0,0.0

We paid for the top package which I thought included all the rides only to find that some of the rides you had to pay additional money for which was strange!!! They are not big rides but they are very scary because they sound like they are literally going to fall apart at any minute. Most of the ride operatives look miserable as sin and look like they truly hate their jobs! Also they have very strange opening times for the rides for instance they advise you go on the rides before the water park area, so we went around the rides and come to the log flume next to be told it was shut and would be opening at 4pm??? So we went and got changed in the comunAl changing area and went to investigate the water park!!! Well half the slides were shut and the ones that were open also need some tlc, the towers on which they sit are metal and are rusty as hell so we were scared the towers would collapse on us, the one was visibally moving which was petrifying! So we finished in the water park and went for food which was OK as you would expect, we then went back to the log flume at the children's request only to get soaked after getting dry, so really they should keep the flume open for longer so you don't have to get wet twice! The major downside to this place were the toilet facilities, they were discusting, they do not cater for western people as there was not one scrap of toilet paper at all, the toilets were filthy and soaked and there were even dirty sanitry towels on the floor, the toilet doors were rotten and to be quite honest I would of felt better finding a bush to toilet in, if your English visiting leisure world I'd take some toilet tissue, and some toilet wipes to clean the toilets down with before using! All in all it was an ok day but due to the amount of rides that were shut we were done and dusted in a few hours and fairly bored of going on the same rides over and over!

Then at the tickets counter couple of guys who were really busy with fixing some sound clip of their own was not willing to listen to my request nor neither wanted to call his superior, reason given phone lines were out. I sincerely offered my mobile for them to make a call, which they didn't have time to do so.

Specially with ride payments. Best is to pay for all at the front gate. Cuz nobody knows anything inside. Rides were good and thrilling. But safty precautions were not enough in my opinion. Water park was great. But the have specific time for wave pool and other rides. So we have to do stuff at there times not ours. But overall a good spend the day with family.,"June 18, 2015",0.0,0.0

They were kind enough to give us a good package. The lunch was lovely and the rides are pretty decent. If you don't like crowds you should go on a weekday! Their changing rooms need to be done up a bit better as should their washrooms in the ladies. If you are a first timer always inform the attendants at the rides. Go there in the morning to make full use of all rides.,"March 29, 2015",0.0,0.0
