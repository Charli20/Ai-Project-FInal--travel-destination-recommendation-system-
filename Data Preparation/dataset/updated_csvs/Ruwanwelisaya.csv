This remarkable hemispherical monument, originally constructed in 140 BC by king Dutugemunu, stands as one of the tallest ancient structures in the world at a height of 103 metres, with a circumference of 290 metres and housing and enshrines a large amount of Buddha’s relics within.  Although king Dutugemunu commenced its construction, it was completed after he passed away. The Ruwanweliseya, constructed primarily of brick, is a marvel of ancient engineering.  The sheer volume of bricks required for its construction is staggering.  Its iconic white appearance is maintained by periodic painting of the outer plaster.  It is a living shrine that had been drawing pilgrims and awe-struck visitors for centuries! During our visit there, we joined the many devotees venerating and worshipping the stupa.  As is customary at religious sites, visitors are required to dress modestly and remove their footwear before entry.

But in the list of tallest buildings and structures in the world built before the 20th century, Ruwanvelisseya, with its height of 101 meters by meters, is ahead of Notre Dame in Paris.

The dome is crowned by a conical spire of Kot Kerella, between which is the cylindrical neck of Devata Kotuva. Ruwanvelisseya Dagoba is highly valued by Sri Lankan Buddhists because of the precious relics in the stupa.

Dating back to 380AD, the site contains ancient ruins, dagobas and temples, all ""contained"" in an archaeological park.

In my opinion, in general, the whole site is pretty disappointing.

The archeological area to visit is really huge. You can see many beautiful stupas like Ruwanwelisaya and many other things. If you want to visit the area in the matter my suggestion is to rent a bike. If you think of walking only you are going to miss many things also because you cannot find many signs. Another way to move around is by tuk tuk. You can bargain the price and get a full service at a reasonable price. 1500 rupees is a good deal. However you need to be aware of tuk tuk drivers. I would say that 99% of tuk tuk drivers are really nice but black sheep are behind the corner. The price of the ticket to enter Anuradhapura archeological area is pretty expensive. More precisely it costs 4600 rupees. A ticket is made of three stubs that need to be torn off every time you enter one of the three areas. There are some tuk tuk drivers who might ask you to give them your ticket so that they can show it to the surveillance staff in order to enter the area. If they ask for your ticket, DO NOT give it to them. The ticket belongs to you. It doesn't belong to the tuk tuk drivers. The point is that there are some tuk tuk drivers who take their customers tickets just to show them what they want to show. They aim at ending their trip with the customers asap so that they can start a new trip with other tourists who will be sold the same tickets partly used by the previous tourists.To cut it short tuk tuk drivers resell those tickets to other tourists at a reduced price and take the money deriving from the sell. So be careful. I also want to give some quick information on how to arrive in Anuradhapura if you come from Dambulla. Dambulla is a small city. There is not bus station but of course there are bus stops. The one where you can catch the bus to Anuradhapura is on Kandy road (the main road) 200 meters after the clock tower on your left next to Bata shoe shop. The bus numbers to consider are 15 and 43.

It is reputedly built with 100 million bricks and the original temple was built in 140BC. Over time it has had to be rebuilt as at one time it was a ruin in the 19th century and it was rebuilt to twice the original size and completed in 1940. It is 103 metres high and 290 metres in circumference. Stupas were built to enshrine relics of Buddha Most people were dresses in white and families were there as well. There was incense pervading the atmosphere and people were buying flowers and gifts to be left by the temple. People were praying near the temple and it was so peaceful even with so many people (not many Europeans visit here and they are really missing out).  There was a procession of people making their way to the temple and a bolt of cloth in bright red was gradually unwound as people took hold of the cloth so the cloth procession just got longer and longer as more people joined it.

The next thing I notices, was the group of people working feverishly infront of the dagoba, braiding tree branches together to provide roofing for the hastily built market that lay in the parking lot at the foot of the structure... As I got closer, I began to truly understand the length of the cloth being wrapped around the structure. Not only did this put it’s size in perspective, but seeing the size of the workers in comparison to this massave structure was truly awesome. I shed my sandals and began to walk around the stupa. The ground was hot, and the rocks on the side facing the sun were like hotplates as you walked.,, Every so often as you walked around the structure you would see small structures showcasing Buddha’s. At many of these you’d see entire families with cloths laid out, sitting for presumably hours and meditating en mass When I finally finished circling I headed to the small shanty market set up infront of the temple and picked up some water.","January 2, 2019",0.0,0.0

I find the entrance fee heavily  overprices for what it is. The Ruwanwelisaya Dagoba is just one of many historical sites scattered across many km2. When buying the ticket (which is at quite some random place) you get basically nothing. No map/no brochure nothing. So unless you do home work on how to visit the place/what to see you will have to hire a guide (so additional cost). If you do not have a driver there will be also an additional cost to hire a transportation as well as the area can not be seen on foot. The Anuradhapura has few pagodas (dagobas) which are in general well preserved (looking very similar) and then tons on badly preserved buildings (only things what is left over are some brinks showing the outline of the buildings) and this is basically it. Few sites will have some basic information about the site. There is also an museum which is like 2 or 3 rooms with few artifacts that one can see in like 10min. If you are on the budget/time constrains I would skip this place all together and just visit Polonnaruwa as I think it is more to see/better preserved sites and just a better value for the 25USD that you will pay for Polonnaruwa as well.","October 25, 2017",0.0,0.0

We were there on the day the Bodhi tree - a very ancient tree -  was celebrating an anniversary and there were hundreds of pilgrims dressed in white and bringing gifts of flowers. A very memorable visit. Appropriate dress for all Buddhist temples includes no hats or shoes.We were asked to wear long trousers, but as it's very hot and you're often travelling elsewhere, I would say that zip off trousers for men are really useful. Ladies - knees must be covered , crops were fine and some other tourists wore a sarong to cover their shorts whilst visiting. Another reviewer has mentioned the heat of the paving you have to walk on with bare feet.We were there late morning and the paving  ( and there's a lot of it!) was red hot - so hot that we were hopping from one foot to another trying to avoid burning our feet. Little trainer socks are invaluable!! It's quite acceptable to wear them and your feet don't burn. All stupas / temples require shoes to be removed (there's always someone to look after them for you for a very small sum) but some are surrounded by large gritty areas and those little socks are great!

If you are going to Anuradhapura it is highly unlikely that you will just go to see just one of the many attractions there. This is an interesting place to visit for those interested in history and culture.  It covers the ruins of a vast Buddhist monastic city. There are gigantic stupas the size of Egyptian pyramids, which contain holy Buddhist relics and an incredible irrigation system that are both nearly 2000 years old. Also to be visited on the site is the Sri Maha Bohdi – apparently one of the world’s oldest and most revered trees. It is probably worth retaining the services of an official guide, such is the complexity of the history and scale of the site.  We attended on a Sunday which due to the site’s highly religious importance meant it was very crowded with pilgrims.  From a cultural point of view this was fascinating, but those interested in the history of the place might find a less busy, mid-week visit, more rewarding.

Ruwanweli Dagoba is said to contain relics of Buddha.  It is the second most venerated buddhist site (next to Sri Maha Bodhi) in the historic Anuradhapura. We went to see this colossal structure, marvelled for its architectural qualities, early in the morning and again late in the evening.  We walked all around the dome observing throngs of devouts offering flowers as well as people in meditation and religious worship. The Dagoba is said to have been built around 140 b.c. by king Dutugemunu. The original stupa had been about 55 metres in height and had been expanded and renovated by many kings thereafter. Currently it stands at 107 metres in height and 93 metres in diameter. According to history, King Dutugamunu, who initiated the construction, did not live to see the completion of this massive Dagoba. His brother took over the construction when the king fell ill. The king wanted to see the Daboba before his death.  The upper incomplete portion was completed using bamboo, and covered with white cloth.  The king had been carried on his deathbed to show the ""completed"" dagoba. You see the statues of King Dutugamunu and his mother Vihara Maha Devi around the Dagoba. Wonderful place to visit if you are interested in architecture and history.  An essential site of veneration for Buddhists! Note:  Foreigners need to purchase a ticket (about 16 usd) that covers visits to all historic Anuradhapura locations.  Visitors are required to be appropriately dressed and no shoes to be worn within the premises.  There was no objection to taking photographs.","January 5, 2017",0.0,0.0

In the hotel I stayed in, City Centre Lodge, they offered me a tuktuk tour (they insisted it was impossible by bike). The driver took us only to the places where they never check the tickets and lied to us about the other places, saying those could only be visited from outside. I was following the map and we missed the most important ones and, as we finished by 1pm we finally had to stay one extra day (of course in a different hotel) in order to visit the main places. When we went back to the hotel and complained about the places we hadn't visited the owner started to follow us on his car shouting and threatening.

Instead of paying for the ticket, I'd suggest cycling away and entering from another direction. There are plenty of small roads which don't have ticket booths.

Once I read more about it, I realized what a privilege it was to have seen these pivotal structures.
