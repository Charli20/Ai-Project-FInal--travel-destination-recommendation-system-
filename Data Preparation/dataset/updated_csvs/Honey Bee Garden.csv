This can be due to the super-fresh ingredients, or the fact that you have cooked yourself or simply to Ruwini's kitchen art and clear instructions. Or maybe a little bit of everything. We had an entertaining time with interesting insights into and insights from Ruwini's kitchen, which we enjoyed very much in every respect. Thank you so much! Alex","April 20, 2025",0.0,0.0

Ruwini welcomes you at her home, starting with a cup of tea before starting the actual cooking class. She speaks English very well, learns you all about the ingredients and spices and guides you very well through the cooking. Together you make rice, multiple curries and extra's. It was a wonderful experience and we were very glad we found her! If you want to learn how to make Rice & Curries the Sri Lankan way (home made style) this is a must visit in Ella! After the cooking you get to eat all the delicious food you just prepared, it was awesome! You even get the recipes afterwards to try it at home yourself.","October 12, 2023",0.0,0.0

Ruwini was so lovely and the food was absolutely delicious, we couldn't believe we'd made it. Then we sat down to eat and were left to enjoy our food. We left absolutely stuffed and Ruwini then sent the recipes on. One tip is to try and add some extra notes as soon as the recipes are emailed over, as some are just ingredients and I had to think quite hard to remember the steps once I got round to making them. This is just at the bottom of Little Adam's Peak so a great way to work up an appetite just before too.

My kids loved especially making the rotis. She explained a lot and let us take pictures, involved us to cut, and sent us the recipes. However, as we didn't cook everything ourselves as you do in Thailand (in Thailand everyone gets a stove and has to make every step, here it was more a shared thing with following the instructions), I am not sure I'll be able to cook the dishes. It would have been handy to have the recipes during the class with us adding comments on the paper as you go.

We spent a wonderful evening with 6 others learning to cook a range of Sri Lankan curries (even making our own coconut milk) in a real family kitchen. We learned about the different spices, cooking processes, and of us were encouraged to participate and try out different tasks. Our favourite task of all was eating the delicious meal at the end of the night and chatting with our new friends made during the class. The next day we immediately went to the super market to buy some of the spices to bring home to New Zealand so we can attempt to recreate our Sri Lankan feast at home!","February 3, 2018",0.0,0.0

Even without electricity she managed to let us prepare many dishes: the power disability actually had a nice charm to it. We made a variety of different curries, dahl, rotties, vegetable pots, salad, papadum. We cooked with all homemade spicemixes, fresh herbs, and a lot of fresh coconut (oil, water, milk, flakes). After hours in the kitchen, cooking and learning about all the different ingredients, we sat in the garden to eat our dishes. It was a great night for us. The best dinner we had in Sri Lanka!
