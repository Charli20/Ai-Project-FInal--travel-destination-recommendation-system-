While on my way down, I detoured and followed the road on the right instead of going back to my original starting point. I thought I would be able to reach the main road of Kandy city easily but I was wrong. I kept walking and walking and the road did not lead me to the city at the base of the mountain. About an hour walk, I saw a signboard which stated 200 m ahead is the Commonwealth War Cemetery. Since I was near this attraction, I decided to detour and visit this War Cemetery. It was free entrance. There was no one in the cemetery except me. The garden where the tombstones were erected was well manicured and beautifully maintained like a golf course. As the morning sun shone down on the tombs, I read the inscriptions on the tombs and found most died during the World War II period. I understand that the cemetery was a resting place for those who sacrificed their lives in defending Sri Lanka during the Second World War. Wikipedia indicates that there were 203 buried here. Most of them were British and only 26 of them were Sri Lankans. It reminded me of the Kranji Memorial Cemetery in Singapore. But the Japanese Imperialists conquered Singapore and the tyranny lasted for 3 years and 8 months. Sri Lanka did not suffer the same fate as Singapore. The Japanese only sabotaged certain parts of Sri Lanka with air raids but did not occupy the island. For those who perished, most died of sickness and accidents. The Second World War was a war between the Imperialists. The soldiers who died were defending the British Empire not protecting an independent country. The War Cemetery holds little significance for the locals. It was just a memorial ground for the relatives of those British soldiers to visit the graves and remember the dead. The surrounding scenery near to the Cemetery was gorgeous with waterfalls and lush greenery. It is a good hiking ground exploring the inner beauty of Kandy.","March 30, 2019",0.0,0.0

The caretaker noticed us walking through and came to hand us a flyer. When a downpour started he came to find us with an umbrella and started chatting to us in the process. He then proceeded to guide us through the whole cementary pointing out specific graves and stories. Due to the rain we visited a bit longer than planned but it was certainly well worth it, there is also a little museum hut that the caretaker will happily open so people can go and look at the photographs displayed in there. Entrance is free but there is a donation box at the gate, I do hope that visitors contribute a few rupees in appreciation of this well looked after sombre place and the lovely caretaker who has been doing his job passionately for the last 18 years.","September 7, 2015",0.0,0.0

The first impression I got was the similarities to this cemetery and the Allied one in Souda Bay on the Island of Crete, both not to small but big enough to walk around and pay your respects, as this little cemetery is also very well kept as it should be. Now, walking around you become acutely aware that there are people from all walks of life who have paid the ultimate price serving their countries just going by the different headstones, and being an ex-serviceman I found this very important too. As in November I'm of to Belgium for the 100th anniversary of WWI and the Menin Gate ceremony as well as exploring the massive battle sites and cemeteries which abound there. Now, great credit must also go to the locals here who work tirelessly keeping this place all neat and tidy, which goes a long way in preserving the past especially in today's uncaring World.
