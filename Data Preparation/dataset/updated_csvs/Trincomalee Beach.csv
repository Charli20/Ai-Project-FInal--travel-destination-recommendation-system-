It is popular for its own natural harbor. Main nation who live there is Tamil community. Main tourist attraction in this area is the coastal sandy beach. Uppaweli, Marble beach, #Nilaweli_beach, #Arisimale beach and Trinco beach are the most beautiful beach areas that I can recommend personally. Many foreigners who are in love with Sri Lankan climate visit the coastal areas to chill in the sun shines. Sun and sea is so closed with many tourists as it is #so Sri Lanka. Even you can do watersports like Diving, Scuba diving, snorkeling definitely in Trinco area. It’s unbelievable to see the hot water springs in Trinco. Have you ever seen or heard about this water springs that I’m saying about? It always springs out hot water from these natural wells. Also you can bath there and get the real experience of what I said. I think that you cannot have a proper idea about what I said till you see the place which I said. So can you at least imagine on this? “What is called this hot water spring” If not let’s have a visit there and enjoy our day time with this unbelievable place. Koneshwaram temple (or we called it as a Kovil) is a main religious place where people visit without any religious margin. People from all over the country visit this place without any religious difference. They pray for god and plead mercy from god on their troubles which they face in their lives. Though this is especially important for the Tamil community in Sri Lanka other people also visit this place and they have various myths and believes made around this place. This is a place where full within the whole year from local and foreign visitors. This is situated a bit far away from the main road but crowded a lot. Though the area is crowded a lot still the wild deer are working here and there beside the roads to this big Kovil, because they have already practiced to be fed from the visitors. “Welgam vehera” a ruined temple which reveals so many details about an ancient civilization of our Sri Lanka. Buddhist people who visit Trinco area never forget to visit this ancient temple. You will feel very calm nature after visiting the place. Those are the highlights which I can bring towards you about the Trincomalee area. Anyway my invitation is for all of you to experience this beautiful sun and sea.","June 2, 2019",0.0,0.0

For example, my guide told me that we could go to Trincomalee and take the boat to snorkel on a Wednesday.  I found out just before Wednesday that boat trips to see whales/dolphins in Trincomalee is only available by Navy ships on Sat and Sun and only if they have at least 100 passengers.  Also, if the waves are too high, then no boats will be allowed to go out for safety reasons.  I was told that no small or private ships are allowed in Trincomalee.  Also, for example, in September 2012, the road from Sigiriya to Trincomalee has a lot of construction, so the drive will be long (~3.5 hrs)  and parts of it will be stop and go due to one way traffic allowed at one time.  So, if you *really* want to go somewhere, make sure the driver is clear about what you want or he might talk you into somewhere else once you are in Sri Lanka, like my driver Siroshan Silva did.  He committed to going and then backed out.  It turned out on that day in my itinerary, which I very clearly indicated on email, that attraction was not available and he didn't check that before telling me that it was possible.  I do not recommend him.  The rating is based on other ratings and I didn't want to throw off the average.  I'm just trying to provide info, so people can plan their trip, if they want to take the boat trip.","July 25, 2014",0.0,0.0

Our guide was really helpful in putting together our itinerary on the go as we did not have any in mind when we arrived. We visited Fort Frederick as well as went on a scuba diving tour. Had a lovely time on the beach as well which was clean and not too crowded. You should watch the fishermen bring their nets in in the morning! Our drive up from Dambulla to Trinco was enjoyable as our guide stopped to show us wildlife along the way as well. We were lucky enough to find an elephant just a few metres from the road. The drive back from Trino to Colombo was a bit long but again our guide brought us to the Hot Springs and the ancient site of Mihinthale. We highly recommend our guide!

There were a few foreigners that I encountered. It is quite a busy town just good to stay one night. There are a few guest houses where common facilities are offered, with some cleanliness.","February 19, 2014",0.0,0.0

This is the best out of the lot in terms of cleanliness. The beach is especially clean in the Nilaveli area and Marble Beach area. One of the other special things about the beach is that there is a lot of sea shells everywhere. Various kinds! Sometimes while picking up the shells, you may pick up a live one or two as well. Watch out for that. In the Uppuveli area, in one part of the beach we found a couple of dead Puff Fishes. Probably they have fallen off fishing nets. You might also want to be mindful of jelly fish as people say that there are more jelly fish in the sea in this area. We did see some sea urchins in China Bay but not in Nilaveli or Uppuveli. But on one occasion, we saw a couple of tiny creatures of different shapes and they looked like plastic. As regards the sea, there is a tendency for the sea in this area to get rough in different parts of the year. Although the sea was not too rough at the time we visited, we were advised neither to swim in the sea nor to go to Pigeon Island as it might be dangerous. There are indications of the condition of the sea near all the hotels so I guess one does not have to worry too much in that regard. If you are white skinned and if you want a tan in a clean beach, this is THE place for that!","January 8, 2014",0.0,0.0
