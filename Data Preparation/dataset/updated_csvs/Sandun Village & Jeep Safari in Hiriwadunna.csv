We were traveling with an 8 yr old and a 3 year old and the way every portion of this trip made them feel special created the most memorable day!  Starting with an ox cart ride, a canoe ride, then a local village family shared how to create a coconut dish before we were served an incredible meal that the kids ate everything!!!  It was a day we will never forget!  This tour is a MUST!","June 3, 2025",0.0,0.0

You will be met at the bottom of the track by your river guide, a little walk further will get you to the edge of the lake which is a lot bigger than what you will expect. The catamaran owner will navigate through the reeds and show you some of the skillfull crafts  using water lilies making hats and necklaces in seconds. Such a peaceful part of your day.  You will get the opportunity to visit a hut where a lady will show you how she cooks and prepares meals, fresh and tasty, simple and quick makes you wonder why additives, emulsifiers, and all those additional ingredients are put in store purchased foods. As you make your way back across the waters you are returned to the starting point by Jeep which ironically enough appears a lot bumpier a ride than when riding in the back of the carriage.","October 27, 2024",0.0,0.0
