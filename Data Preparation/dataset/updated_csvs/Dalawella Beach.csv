This is wrong on so many levels. Encouraging wild animals to associate humans with food is only going to end badly for both parties. I found the experience of watching people sell plastic (of course) bags of seaweed to idiot tourists feed and touch (and take selfies) with the turtles so distressing that I am not sure I want to go back. Dear Sri Lanka - Yala was spoilt (although well done for your recent efforts to encourage licences and proper behaviours) please don’t let marine habitats go the same way. And tourists. Behave yourselves!","January 2, 2024",0.0,0.0

Go on the morning and the beach is quiet, the sea is calm from the  natural tide breakers from the arch shaped rocks. There's not too many people around and you are likely to see some turtles swimming in the inlet. Go late morning onwards and there's loads more people, the sea gets choppier and some people are chasing the turtles. It's their habitat not ours and people are damaging them by touching them. Their shells are going white from touching and it's slowly killing them. If you see one, look but don't touch. It's a lovely beach and well looked after but it's being spoilt by too many tourists being allowed. We came away early because of this. You can hire 2 sunbeds and an umbrella for 1000rupees which is good value.","March 2, 2022",0.0,0.0

It’s located behind the Dream Cabana hotel which is a fairly low end hotel right on the beach.  The owner charges a fee to use the swing and he told us the reason he charges is because people use the swing and don’t get off of it.  So, now he charges Rs 500 per person but you get 3 rides on the swing for that.  In US dollars that is just under $3, so I was perfectly fine with paying.  This is an example of social media blowing up a little tree swing and making a local guy a lot of extra money, good for him, I support it.  My teenage kids had a great time for few bucks. The other way to get access to the swing is purchase some drinks and they will let you ride the swing. Note - we visited in June so the sea was very rough.  It’s ok because you get off the swing on the beach.  If you want to go to this place when the sea is calm, you need to visit between December and March.","July 2, 2019",0.0,0.0

Also, the beach must have become very popular this season, as there are lots of people here; the admittedly more touristy nearby Unawatuna beach is much less crowded these days.

Lovely turquoise water, plenty of palm trees, safe swimming by the left hand side (especially during the morning), several bars that rent sun lounges cheaply, palm swings at either side of the beach for 200 rupees. We even saw giant turtles! Enjoy it! But careful with the ripe currents when not swimming in the ""safe"" area!","January 9, 2018",0.0,0.0

It is pretty quiet and the sea life is amazing. In the sea areas we could still stand up in, we saw beautiful colourful fish, a shoal of about 500 mini silver fish and even two giant turtles! There's a few nice restaurants and great rock pools two. Something to do for the whole family.","December 22, 2017",0.0,0.0

We decided to day trip down to Dalawella beach which is only 10 minutes tuk tuk and what a find! The beach has formed a little cove which is great for relaxing, swimming and also cuts the strong waves from the ocean here. There are also areas for surfing, but they are near rocks so probably best for more advanced surfers. Not too many people here, very suitable for children. We also brought our snorkel gear here and what a treat! Lots of little and big fish in the coral as well as SEA TURTLE! We saw a very relaxed pregnant female in the calm waters! What a great find! This is my favourite beach in Sri Lanka!","November 29, 2017",0.0,0.0

Hidden between two popular beaches, the extremely busy Unawatuna beach and perhaps the slightly less popular Talpe Beach, is Dalawella beach. Dug our feet in to the soft sandy beach, swam a little, tried a rope-ride tied to a coconut tree by some local children, lay on our towels all day long... ah... simply magic.","July 13, 2017",0.0,0.0
