Tamil heritage manuscripts *palm leaves) and about 91,000 volume of books involving Tamil history was burnt to ground by mob (with the blessing from official government) in the early 80's. After the war ended about 6 years ago, Janna people built the library first. It is an amazing testament to the Tamil's intellectual and will power.The building from outside is pretty to look at. The only problem is tourists can not get access to anywhere but the reading room. There are photos of NY Public Library, Library of Congress and Columbia University's library which is my husband's alma mater and my husband is a retired professor/founder of the Dental School in Stoney Brook in NY. I asked him to go to the front desk, introduce himself and ask if we can go inside to see the collection. It was very easily granted. What was disconcerting is how they are now storing the donated palm leaf manuscripts. They were very kind to open the cabinet and let us touch (we did NOT) but we were horrified to see that these manuscripts are not even properly folded. They are just piled up, dis organized, collecting dust. Rest of the rooms have some Tamil and some English books and no, it is not a world class collection. However, how does one tiny city in a tiny country rebuild a world class library after losing 91,000 volumes of its heritage?

Still all Sri Lankans contributed in some way to redo the library. because of this back round this is visited by all visitors to Jaffna.

Has been restored, the bright white building stands out on the sky line near the seaside. The library gardens are on quite a large block, and it is surrounded by parks and fields, and lake, so it is good to take a peaceful walk around, just outside the city centre. Bring a bit of food for the resident dog (he's shown on dog-star charity). Their health could certainly use it to stave off the mites. The children's park is just across the road, and the courts building a further block away. It is also easy to visit the library, and then walk a short distance, past the pillar, stadium, and around to the old fort. A good walk with sea breeze.","December 16, 2014",0.0,25.66844919786097,13.903743315508022,2.13903743315508,20.32085561497326,37.96791443850268
