There is no entrance fee. We first visited the Keeramalai Ponds, and then the temple located close by - almost opposite the ponds. It is a sacred Hindu temple venerated and worshipped from ancient times. The temple had sadly been destroyed badly in 1990 during the civil war.  It was reopened after reconstruction only in February 2012.  The old temple entrance and some of the damaged can still be seen. Being a sacred place, we were careful to dress modestly.  Visitors are required to remove footwear (socks ok) and maintain appropriate decorum and respect.  Males remove their shirts and enter the temple bare bodied to display respect.  Although I am not a Hindu, in accordance with the tradition I purchased and made some offerings though it is not an absolute requirement.  Hindus believe that their offerings to the deities would bring them blessings and aid them in fulfilling their wishes and needs. We circulated through the temple, enjoying the pious atmosphere and looking at the many and various murals, monuments and statues.  A priest placed a small mark on our forehead blessing us!  I also made it a point to drop a small note into the donation box. Thousands of Hindus from all over the world come here to pray and receive blessings.
