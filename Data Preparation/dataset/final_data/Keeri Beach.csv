Safe for anyone to spend any length of time solo or group.Enjoyable,4,Missing,visited the Keeri Beach with my family members and had really a great time in the cool waters. Shallow and safe free from rough surfaces and corals . Wind mills are along the beach to generate electricity. Located near Mannar Town to  Thalvupadu  road . Find Keeri Junction and proceed to the beach. There is an Ancient  Mosque with a Tomb of a saint on the other side of the Keeri Junction marked as Keeri Internal Road to have a quite time. Plenty of Palmyrah Products like dried Yams and The yam powder good to control diabetes . Yet to be developed with facilities for Tourism,"February 26, 2024",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,33.33333333333333,66.66666666666666

You need to drive through unpaved gravel road parallel to sea. Go towards the location marked as public toilet. There you have changing rooms and bathing facilities after bathing at sea. The sea is very calm in the days we visited and it’s just like having a swim in a pond. The water looks dirty with dust particles hovering around. I’m some days jelly fishes do roam around. So be bit cautious when having a bath. No any lifeguards on duty here. The beach is pretty much vacant.,"November 29, 2019",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,33.33333333333333,66.66666666666666
