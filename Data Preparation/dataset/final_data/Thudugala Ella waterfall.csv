When you visit Tudugala Falls you have to go through a rubber plantation. The ruins of an old bungalow can also be seen as you continue along the small footpath.As we continue along that trail we can hear the sound of the waterfall well.This waterfall consists of two deep and shallow areas.During periods of heavy rainfall, a large mass of water flows through the falls.Actually this water is very clean and very cold.Bathing in the cool waters of the falls gives you an unforgettable experience. I think it's best to take your food and drink with you when you visit the falls. Because the number of shops and facilities around it is minimal.It is best to go at a less crowded time to have the most peaceful experience. During the holidays, a considerable number of people visit this place. If you want to have a good experience, be more careful about it.","January 19, 2022",0.0,25.806451612903224,9.67741935483871,0.0,32.25806451612903,32.25806451612903

No one at the hotel knew about the waterfall, which was surprising as it was one of a few in the area, with this being the biggest. It is tucked away behind an old rubber tree plantation house but in the middle of a rubber tree nursery with over 40,000 trees being grown. You walk down a small track and follow the noise of the water as there are no signs posted. As you get near the waterfall, you can hear the water running fast through the bushes and trees. Theres two parts, the lower part is pretty flat, but another 100m walk up the river reveals a secluded deeper waterfall where you can bathe in shallow water. Recommendation Dont go during holidays as the locals swamp the place, especially POYA day. Take lots of water as there are no jungle shops, and sun cream.","February 5, 2017",0.0,25.806451612903224,9.67741935483871,0.0,32.25806451612903,32.25806451612903
