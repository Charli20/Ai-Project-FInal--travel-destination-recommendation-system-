When we walked the small bridge over the lily pond to get closer to the eroded brick elephant wall, we noticed that the gate was unlocked so we stepped inside. The site could use a new coat of paint and maintenance.  It is easy to see that the statues and Buddhas were ancient but there was very little signage.  There were two small houses/structures to the left and right, outside the elephant wall but we did not know which was the museum so we did not wish to intrude. We saw several similar stupas that appeared much cleaner and nicer surrounded with colorful Buddhist flags.
