The reunion with relatives in Jaffna took us to four of the Siva Temples in Sri Lanka during the first seven days of our Sri Lanka Odyssey. Our first stop, on March 3rd, was at the Munneswaram temple situated in a village in the Puttalam District. Hindus believe that it is one of the the five temples they need to visit in their life time. The others being Naguleswaram temple which we visited in Keerimalai in the Kankesanthurai district on March 4th and Thiruketheeshwaram in Mannar District and the Koneswaram temple in Trincomalee (Thirukonamalai) -- both the next day. All these, including Rameswaram in India form the five ancient temples (Ishwarams) dedicated to Shiva. According to Hindus, the Munneswaram temple near Puttalam is the temple where King Rama prayed to Shiva after killing Ravana to seek forgiveness over the death of many in the war. Hindus believe that the Naguleswaram temple's adjacent water tank, the Keerimalai Springs, has curative properties. The temple was largely destroyed by Jesuit missionaries following the Portuguese conquest of the Jaffna kingdom, restored by Arumuga Navallar in 1894. The Thiruketheeshwaram temple had existed for more than 2,400 years. During our visit to this temple, we witnessed a temple devotee from Vavunia singing Thevarams. His aim was to complete the 800 thurmurai thevarams in one month. The Trincomelee Koneswaram temple was built by the Cholas/Pandian kings. The temple is situated atop Konesar Malai, at a commanding position overlooking the Indian Ocean. It is also known as the ""Mount Kailash of the South"". The temple, mentioned in Mahabaratha and Ramayana, was visited by Arunagirinathar and is the easternmost shrine of the five ancient Ishwarams of Shiva on the island.","March 22, 2018",0.0,30.5,5.5,1.25,17.5,45.25

The temple premises are well maintained and very clean. Watching people pray with devotion, hearing the bells, and standing in front of Lord Shiva’s sanctum gives a beautiful sense of peace. Every visit makes me feel more connected to my faith and culture.

The most sacred of the Pancha Ishwarams of Sri Lanka, it was built significantly during the ancient period on top of Konesar Malai, a promontory overlooking Trincomalee District, Gokarna Bay and the Indian Ocean. The monument contains its main shrine to Shiva in the form Kona-Ishvara, shortened to Konesar. The complex was destroyed in colonial religious attacks between 1622 and 1624 and a fort was built at the site from its debris. A 1632-built temple located away from the city houses some of its original idols. Worldwide interest was renewed following the discovery of its underwater and land ruins, sculptures and Chola bronzes by archaeologists and Arthur C. Clarke. It has been preserved through restorations, most recently in the 1950s. Granted ownership of villages in its floruit to form the Trincomalee District, Trincomalee village is located on the cape isthmus within the compounds. Revenue from the temple provides services and food to residents. Koneswaram has many strong historical associations. The shrine is described in the Vayu Purana, the Konesar Kalvettu and Tevaram hymns by Sambandhar and Sundarar as a Paadal Petra Sthalam along with its west coast Ishwaram counterpart Ketheeswaram temple, Mannar, and was praised for its tradition by Arunagirinathar upon his visit. The Dakshina Kailasa Puranam and Manmiam works note it as Dakshina/Then Kailasam (Mount Kailash of the South) for its longitudinal position and pre-eminence, it lies directly east of Kudiramalai west coast Hindu port town, while it is the easternmost shrine of the five ancient Ishwarams of Shiva on the island. This religious temple is well-preserved for all devotees and we have a lot of respect and believe in Lord Shiva as Sri Lankans. As Sri Lankans, we pay to visit the said temple and pay our utmost humble respect and worship Lord Shiva whenever we visit Trico or pass by this lovely town at any given time. People from all over the world visit this temple. It was an amazing feeling to visit back the said temple grounds with my family during our visit to Trinco again. We will always retain the said temple since we are so blessed to have the said temple in such holly /religious grounds of Trinco the history left behind and around the old port of Trinco which is one of the most amazing natural harbours of the world the said temple is amazing to watch to any visitors around the world.","September 26, 2024",0.0,30.5,5.5,1.25,17.5,45.25
