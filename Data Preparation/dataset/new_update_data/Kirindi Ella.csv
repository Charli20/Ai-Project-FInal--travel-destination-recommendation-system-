Interesting. Thank you to our driver for getting us there and back :) It is quite easy to miss, it is on the right of the sign that has the information on it. The path to the viewing is not so bad but if you plan on going to the bottom, be prepared with long trousers as it is very overgrown! We went up and parked up by the tea factory and caught a tuctuc to the entrance and had a wander down to the view point. Even in the dry period it looked pretty cool!","September 14, 2018",0.0,33.33333333333333,11.11111111111111,0.0,33.33333333333333,22.22222222222222

However, this is not much famous in travelers. Around 100 steps down to the view point of the waterfall. But, if you want more adventure, you can go to the bottom of the fall.

It is in the Pelmadulla area, several kilometers off the Badulla-Colombo main road. The road to the falls is not good but is accessible by vehicle.As with all falls, it is spectacular in the rainy season. The area has significant rainfall during several months of the year which adds to the likelihood of poor road surfaces and mud-slides but contributes to the wonderful lush green surroundings of these falls which adds to the overall beauty. The spectacular nature of the falls can be viewed from a reasonable distance or one can reach the falls by walking from the nearest place a vehicle may be parked.","January 21, 2018",0.0,33.33333333333333,11.11111111111111,0.0,33.33333333333333,22.22222222222222

A huge amount of water is flowing through this waterfall.  Located at palmadulla. You can easily find it on google maps. Road is very good for any Vehicle.  Surrounding environment is also very nice along the way. Of you are in good physical condition you should  definitely try going to the bottom of watetfall. You can surely have a nice cool bath from here. The path is very sloppy. Highly recommend place.

You can walk across the river get your legs wet to see a great view of the falls. It cools you down. A good tip if you are driving or have a driver is to go all the way down the lane and park up at the hotel at the bottom and buy a few drinks before the short walk to the waterfall. The lane on the way down is very bumpy typical Sri Lankan style.,"August 13, 2016",0.0,33.33333333333333,11.11111111111111,0.0,33.33333333333333,22.22222222222222

When you will be travelling in Colombo - Badulla road via Rathnapura, you have to turn left at the junction just before the Pelmadulla town towards the where Gankanna Central College located. There is a drive of about 6 km in that road to reach out to this waterfall. The road condition is not much good but possible to use a car. Please keep in mind that the read is a narrow road with bends. There is a name board in the road after driving about 7km in that road. You have to park your vehicle at a side of a road (no dedicated car park) and have to walk down from the road. After walking about 50m in that foot path (cement stair case is there), there is a view point which you can have a nice view of the waterfall. If you would like to go closer to the waterfall you have to walk more distance from that point. But it depends on your physical fitness. I have heard that is is possible to reach out to the top of the waterfall too. But still could not try it. This is a waterfall with the height of about 116m. The water stream connects to the Kalu Ganga at a later point.","July 19, 2016",0.0,33.33333333333333,11.11111111111111,0.0,33.33333333333333,22.22222222222222
