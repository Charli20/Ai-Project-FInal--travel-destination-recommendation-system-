We noticed other visitors receiving guided tours but nobody approached us so we just took a look around ourselves.  It's a bit like stepping back in time for anyone who works in modern manufacturing with a lot of manual labour interspersed with some very old machines. Lunch was quite good although our waiter didn't seem all that interested in serving us.  I recommend the Nasi Goreng. We bought some tea from the extensive range in their tourist shop which is worth a visit as you can smell and/or taste most of the teas available.,"January 7, 2019",0.0,44.1025641025641,4.358974358974359,0.5128205128205128,17.94871794871795,33.07692307692307

I asked some questions about tea, none of which they were able to answer, for example question ‘what variety of white tea is this?’ Answer ‘white tea’. Thank you.

The friends who we gave the tea as gifts were, without exception, in agreement. I apologised to them. Maybe we bought a bad batch? So I emailed The Glenloch Tea Company and reported what, when and how it tasted. They didn’t answer let alone acknowledge. I checked the email address on their site several times and it was correct. I waited. Two weeks later I wrote again. No response. Two weeks again and I wrote now three weeks on and not even the courtesy of acknowledgement, a reply or even better an apology! I now believe that they must have so many complaints that they just don’t bother to answer. Therefore I would most certainly choose one of the other plantations to visit but if your guide insists that you visit The Glenloch Tea Factory enjoy the tour but be strongly advised NOT to purchase any tea in their shop.","November 8, 2013",0.0,44.1025641025641,4.358974358974359,0.5128205128205128,17.94871794871795,33.07692307692307

We started our tour seeing the picked leaves being sorted. You are then taken through the whole processing process, from drying, through to cutting, to packing. It was a fascinating insight into a product that so many people enjoy. None of it is staged (although there is some now redundant equipment around to help explain how things were done before some parts of the process were mechanised) so you are seeing tea which well end up in your tea back home being processed. At the end of the tour you are invited to try some of the teas and of course purchase some if you wish.  You can also wander around outside and see people picking tea.

This one was recommended and organised by the local travel agent (ground agent for Kuoni). I imagine this is not dissimilar to other tea factory offerings and as far as I was concerned ticked all the relevant boxes. What surprised me most was that we were touring  a working, commercial operation and allowed to get up close and handle the (largely ancient) equipment and the tea in its different process stages. I was expecting something slightly more sanitised behind Perspex screens with UK-style endless warnings about health and safety etc but blessedly there was none of that. Our friendly guide gave us a brisk tour of the different stages but never hurried us when we wanted to look closer, take photos and generally dilly-dally taking the place in. Information she gave was hugely informative and I learnt a lot about the process. After the machinery we had a tea tasting of 4 of the teas (slightly disappointingly we were just left alone to sample while our guide disappeared - some tasting pointers or things to look out for would have added to the experience) then guided through the retail operation to part with money. We didn't mind and there is no obligation to buy anything and the prices were probably not unreasonable. Finally we had a brief tea-picking experience. Basket-strung-from-the-head photo opportunity rather than a picking experience but was good to do if only to appreciate how hard the real tea pickers work for their low wages. Doing this, my wife managed to pick up a leech too which wasn't part of the formal picking experience but served to again emphasise just one of the hazards of the job for real! (Could have been worse - could have been a venomous snake bite!).

They factory has a nice balcony where you can sample tea (we had four kinds: English Breakfast, Green, White, and Special). They were all quite good, and were a healthy sample size. The balcony overlooked a valley, and was quite a pleasant view. However, there is some major construction happening right below the balcony which was a bit noisy, but hopefully it will be terminated soon. The tour guides wanted to know if we wanted to eat, but all they had was mostly things we don't eat (breads, pasta, cake and cookies, etc), and it was on the pricey side, so we declined. However, the other guests seemed to like their food, so it might be a good place to eat. We were then taken on a factory and plantation tour, both which were very interesting since to that point I really didn't know how tea was made, and the difference between black, green, white, and a new tea that I had never heard of 'silver tip'. Apparently it is mainly about the different age of the leafs, and then their is very little difference aside from the fact that black tea is fermented and then dried, whereas the others are steamed. We then bought some tea in the gift shop, which was very reasonably priced, and then I went to have one more delicious green tea before we started to ride again. To my great surprise, they gave me the extra tea again for free since I had bought some tea in the gift shop. The gift shop had all sorts of teas, in all types of formats. They had all the teas mentioned in the samples above, and they had mixes with herbal ingredients. They also had most in loose and bad format. Lastly, they had packages in different sizes and containers. I wanted pure green tea, and I was offered a 200 gram loose tea in a simple box for 1100 rupees, or 100 gram in a display tin for 1000 rupees. Our tour guide was very nice, and was informed. Overall, if you like tea, or are just looking for a nice view, consider stopping here, or at one of the many tea plantations along the way.","December 24, 2015",0.0,44.1025641025641,4.358974358974359,0.5128205128205128,17.94871794871795,33.07692307692307

The tour of the factory was detailed and the guide was very informative. He told us to pose near the tea for photos etc and took some photos for us. We viewed the whole tea making process, which was fascinating. However, at the end of the tour we were taken up to a terrace and provided with a cup of tea (which tasted fantastic by the way) and the guide stood over us, clearly waiting for a tip. My husband explained to him that our other guide (who was driving us around for the whole trip) had not yet taken us to a cash machine and so we had no money to give for a tip. We apologised profusely, however the man just stayed there stood over us, which made us feel very uncomfortable. After a while he gave up, a lady came over and took our cups away quite rudely. I was feeling quite mortified by this time and thought I would at least buy something from the gift shop with my bank card so that we would at least spend some money there. Again, the staff in the shop were abrupt, the lady who served me practically threw my bank card at me. We couldn't leave there quickly enough. I think it should be made much more clear that tips are expected here; we always tip generously, however I think sometimes it helps to remember that we had already paid several thousands of pounds for our holiday, which included the tour. It also wasn't our fault that our driver hadn't taken us to an ATM machine! (I had actually tried to take money out at the airport but he advised against it).

The amazing fresh tea smell permeates the air, and the landscape of Nuwara Eliya is beautiful.   Glenloch is no exception. Our guide to the tea factory spouted many dodgy facts about tea.  For example, she seemed to think black tea was high in vitamin C and had more vitamin C than green tea.   She did not know what fermentation or oxidation were.  When I asked questions to clarify her knowledge, she hit back by asking my travel partner whether I could understand English. Ouch!  She then treated me like a retard who couldn't understand what she was saying, which was totally fine with me, because I knew she didn't know even the basics of the tea making process.   I have attached a picture of the dodgy guide.   Surely it takes only 10minutes of reading Wikipedia to pass some basic facts on and she couldn't even do that. I've attached a pic of the guide. We didn't get a tour of the plantation outside.  We were told we could wander down the path/road to take a better look outside.  We weren't allowed to walk on the plantation slopes as a safety precaution. Once inside, we tasted just one type of tea. It was OK.   The shop was a bit overpriced.  I bought BOP tea in the cheapest packaging, it was 1000rupees. No discounts, no haggling.   Our driver was pretty happy because he got some free tea from the ladies there once we had made our purchases.  I think drivers who bring visitors to Glenloch obviously get perks which depend on how much their visitors spend -  that's enough incentive for them to choose this tea factory over others.  The tea itself tastes great.   Heaps better than the Dilmah you get in Australia. In this factory, the same tea gets packaged as different brands.  The price point is just determined by how fancy the brand is, which is mainly comes down to how beautiful the packaging is.   So you might as well buy the no frills packaging.","November 9, 2018",0.0,44.1025641025641,4.358974358974359,0.5128205128205128,17.94871794871795,33.07692307692307

The actual tea factory looks like every other one in the area, apparently using a design perfected in the 19th century, with machinery invariably from the UK.  It is however interesting to see the process in action, starting with a sort of fermentation where a lot of the water content is removed naturally, through a grinding into small segments and then a final drying.  The there's a lot more to it, particularly the blending, testing, tasting and packaging, but those are the initial steps. All the time specialised machinery is doing the real work. After an informative tour showing the process you are invited to a tasting session where you can try and distinguish between the various products.
