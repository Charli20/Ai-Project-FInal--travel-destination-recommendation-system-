There are swimming opportunities in the pool at the top of the falls.  The best views of the falls and the reservoir below are from viewpoints in the neighbouring tea estate.  Unfortunately the owners of the tea estate are in the process of erecting a forbidding barbed wire fence to restrict access to this area.  We succeeded in persuading the security staff to allow us to walk to the viewpoints.  But others may not be so lucky.","January 28, 2025",0.0,0.0,0.0,16.666666666666664,50.0,33.33333333333333

It is situated within the Gartmore Estate, a tea plantation, and offers stunning views of the surrounding tea fields and the towering Adam's Peak (Sri Pada) in the background. The waterfall is about 25 meters (82 feet) in height and cascades down a rocky slope into a serene pool. It's a less frequently visited destination compared to other popular waterfalls in Sri Lanka, making it an ideal spot for nature lovers and those looking for a peaceful retreat. Visitors often enjoy a short hike through tea plantations to reach the falls, which adds to the charm of the experience.","October 19, 2024",0.0,0.0,0.0,16.666666666666664,50.0,33.33333333333333
