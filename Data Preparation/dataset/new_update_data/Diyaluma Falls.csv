We rode to the bottom of the falls from Ella ( about 1 hour on a motorbike) wondering if we would have to carry our jackets and helmets on the hike and where to safely park the bike.  We were lucky to be greeted by Saman who took care of everything. His guided hike to the waterfalls was great. He has so much knowledge of the forest, stopping along the way to show us different trees and plants. We spent several hours working our way down the different levels of the waterfall, swimming,  rock jumping and rock sliding. The views were breathtaking and we rated it as one of the best days out on our holiday.

You can drive (or be driven) quite high up toward the parking area, and from there it’s another 20–30 minutes uphill to reach the top of the falls. However, compared to the many other activities we’ve done in Sri Lanka so far, we found it quite busy at the waterfalls. Our tuk-tuk driver immediately became our guide, but in hindsight we regretted that a little. We were advised to take a guide so you know where to go after reaching the top, but in our experience you can easily figure this out yourself using Google Maps and by following other people. Our guide also seemed quite rushed, while you really want to spend a few hours relaxing in the natural infinity pools. Our advice: definitely go, but don’t take a guide, and make sure to give yourself enough time.","January 18, 2026",0.0,42.94117647058823,4.705882352941177,1.1764705882352942,16.470588235294116,34.705882352941174

Our guide, Saman, was wonderful and definitely meant we got the most out of our trip. We found Saman’s number on other reviews here and text him when we were still in Udawalawe. He agreed to pick us up from our bus in Wellawaya, drive us all the way to the falls, guide us around and then drop us in Ella when we had finished. He offered a really good price for the day. Saman was so friendly and spoke good English. He arrived early to meet us and took us to his family kiosk at the base of the falls where we were able to leave our heavy bags and change our clothes. He gave our son a coconut and then we took the Tuk-tuk further up the hill. From there it was about a 20-30min walk to the falls. On the way Saman taught us all about the plants growing by the side of the trail. He picked lemongrass and cinnamon for us so we could smell them, showed us cashew trees and rubber that had solidified from rubber trees. Our son was fascinated by all his knowledge. Saman then led us to the highest pool where we were able to swim and skim stones. He showed us safe places to slide through the rocks into the water. There are tiny fish in the water that tickle as they nibble your feet. Further down the falls we were able to jump off a 10m ledge into a deep pool below. It was terrifying but absolutely worth it if you can summon the courage. It’s also a great spectator sport if you’re not up for it yourself! Even further down Saman went and found leaves like mini helicopters which he showed our son how to throw into the wind. The view from the top of the waterfall is breath-taking. We had our favourite day so far in Sri Lanka and this was all down to Saman and his brilliant knowledge. He was so kind with our little boy and made him feel really special and cared for. We had wondered if we needed a guide and it’s definitely possible to do it without one but we wouldn’t have had such an amazing experience if it weren’t for Saman. There are places to buy fruit and little restaurants all the way up and down for food. We spent about 3 hours there and the time flew by. 10/10 for this experience. On the way to Ella, Saman stopped and bought us hot corn on the cob from the roadside. It was delicious. Thank you Saman.

However, we could not have done this trip without a guide. We would not have known which rock pools you could jump into and how to get up and down the mountain. In addition to that the guide will usually take you the first 2 km of the journey, and then you can walk the rest (1km).  In short, it is well worth the money.

From this town it's also verry easy to visit the buduruwagala rock temple (360Lkr) wich is verry beautifull and not touristic at all! We stayed at Bindu Homestay and i can higly recommend this place. It's a verry friendly family and he also has his own tuk tuk and car to bring you to all places you want.

We were told we were going the wrong way and he directed us down some path in which he said was the right way. We trusted this advice as we thought he was being genuinely helpful. This path was overgrown and full of leeches (have a bottle of insect repellent and lighter ready to spray/burn them off as soon as you feel them) after eventually reaching and exploring the waterfalls we found a much much better path back. we popped out (surprise, surprise) where we were originally headed before being led astray by the guides advice. After returning to our Tuk Tuk and confronting the guide we asked him if the path we were going to follow was were the guides go and he laughed in our face and said yes. We expressed our disappointment at his actions and said in Australia or New zealand we would never do this to tourists or deliberately lead them astray simply because they chose to make their own way. Below are clear instructions how to get the falls without utilising the guides who take advantage of tourists and deliberately confuse them or make up that google maps wont work or that its extremely difficult to find the falls, both of which turned out to be lies.

Otherwise, it is indeed a multi-level beautiful waterfall with a number of pools to sit or have fun in. We rode a motorbike from Ella, took about 1-1.5hrs. Fairly good roads  except for the last 15min stretch which were bumpier. At the base of the waterfall (some distance away from the actual waterfall), there is a small parking area and an inn. There are a few local boys/ young men waiting and will offer their service as a guide. We could have bargained to 1500lkr but paid the 2000lkr asked, after hearing from other travellers at our guesthouse how they topped up 500lkr in the end after experiencing the amount of walking and the guide waiting to bring them down at the end. The walk up starts with a fairly straightforward dirt path through rubber trees and a small cluster of houses. However, the rest of it is a climb up the mountain, on uneven, scrabbly rocks, large and small, and cut-in steps in the ground. You should be young or of moderate fitness to do this. Definitely wear proper shoes and have sunscreen and water. Preferably start early in the day and wear longer pants, as the tall grass growing towards the path for much of the climb can get itchy after a while. You will also appreciate the helping hand of the guide as you climb.. At the top there is a coconut seller, then slightly downhill to the actual waterfall. It is fairly easy to get to the various levels of the waterfall. Be careful stepping in and out of the pools as the rocks are slippery with moss. There is only a roti and coconut seller at the waterfall itself. Bring some snacks or you can buy them from the few village grocery shops on the road in. Very friendly locals, we smiled and waved to everyone. From the bottom of the waterfall, you will need to climb back up again to the top where the coconut seller is, to go all the way down again.

Surprisingly there were a few groups of locals (one getting a bit boozy), and some German girls attracting attention in their bikinis. We just took our boots off and cooled our feet off while chatting to the locals (apparently a family of wild elephants come here for a drink most days at around 6:30pm). Sadly we didn't go to the top of the actual falls, because we had to get the bus back to Haputale. It looked really cool and would probably make a great photo. The REAL HIGHLIGHT for me was in fact the bus ride back up to Haputale. Buses going up come approx. every 30min, and the last one is at 1830. It took us just over an hour to hike up, 20min at the top, and 45min to get back down, so we caught the bus at about 1720. There was plenty of space on the bus, and it was a magical journey through the forested hills overlooking the southern lowlands as the sun sets over the mountains. Keep your eyes peeled for macaques as you drive up! Give yourself more time than we did if you're using public transport. Alternatively, if you have your own transport, take a torch with you, stay to see the elephants. :)","September 12, 2016",0.0,42.94117647058823,4.705882352941177,1.1764705882352942,16.470588235294116,34.705882352941174
