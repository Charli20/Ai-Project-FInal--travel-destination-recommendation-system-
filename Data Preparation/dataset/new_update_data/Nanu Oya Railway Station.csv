The long platforms of the recently refurbished station has the amenities needed and a good 2 hours between train times[ my suggestion is to take the 4am train leaving Kandy and reaching Nanuoya by 1030am, and take the return train Podi Manike that normally reach the Nanuoya station by 1230pm. The 2 hour gap will give a visitor sufficient time to take in the atmosphere of the surrounding .Either side of the track, particulalry in the direction of Parakramapura is lined with some of the best tea growth in the hill country.On the other side You could be witness to two fascinating waterfalls by literally standing over them atop the century old cast iron bridges which themselves are an attraction.

My holiday to Sri Lanka was excellent and would have been complete if I got to travel on the 1st Class Observation car for a few stations either from Nanu Oya to Pattipola or Nanu Oya to Thalawakelle. The guy who served me at the station counter (Pramuka) found a seat for me to travel from Nanu Oya to Thalawakelle.  When I went to pay Rs2,000 for the ticket he didn't want to issue the ticket.  Instead he asked me to complete a form where I had to fill the intended travel date, where I wanted to go and my passport details.  He promised to call me that evening before 9.30pm but I never heard back from him.  I needed to know  whether he was able to secure a ticket for me so that I could plan my next day accordingly. Not sure why he didn't want to sell the available ticket to me to travel to Thalawakelle instead.  He initially thought that I was an agent trying to secure a seat.  I then told him that I am a passenger and not an agent. I am very disappointed that I wasn't able to do this train trip.  If I paid black market rates to buy a ticket I could have easily secured a seat. Something needs to be done to clean this mess so that the visitors get a fair chance to enjoy the train journey in Sri Lanka.","January 29, 2024",0.0,24.444444444444443,4.444444444444445,8.88888888888889,20.0,42.22222222222222

The waiting place inside of the building is for people with the tickets for the 1st class only, which we didn't have. At the same time, there are also toilets at the same waiting room.

The train station dated back to British times and was extremely run down with worn out timber sleepers. I am not sure how safe the trains will be. Inside the platform 'cafe' was a plaque which stated that the catering service was taken over on 1st Jan 1969. The trains ran on diesel and equally ill-maintained. The first class cabin had a distinct smell and 'flavour'. I would say its first class till the early 70s, its no different from 3rd class cabin now. Save your money and hire a van or car.

I think it's a bit overrated and that won't impress you so much. b) as an alternative, and in order to experience exclusively the best part of it, I would opt for the very short ""Demodara loop"" (6 kms long; cost of the ticket 10 LKR = ~0,05€). So catch the train directly in Ella, take a seat on the left side of the carriage/coach and get off at the next station (Demodara itself).

So it is advisable for the foreign travelers who are on budget trip to Nuwara Eliya should be aware of the people (Guides & Tuk Tuk Drivers) on your arrival at the station. after passing the ticket counter there are several guides and Tuk Tuk drivers try to give you offers for the hotel reservations and transport to Nuwara Eliya. Most likely you will get disappointment if you accept there offers because most of them provide unclean and unfair hotels. They'll keep following you until you reach the main road which is approxiamtely 100m from the station. So it is best to take Tuk Tuk parked next to the main road. however they'll charge double for the foreign tourists but it is much cheaper than the Tuk Tuk guys parked next to the station. But the better option is to travel by bus from Nanu Oya to Nuwara Eliya for much cheaper. It's better if you ask people out there from bus time and the bus stop. Most of them will try to change your mind to take Tuk Tuk to Nuwara Eliya. Never seek any guide from Tuk Tuk guys. It's better if you ask from any Pedestrians out there. Learning to Bargain is too a great experience if you try. Some guides or Tuk Tuk Guys will try to overcharge after all the services are done. If they do so warn them that you are going to call the police. Then they will leave after swearing some beautiful words at you.
