We were railroaded into buying a tour which was overpriced and not what we wanted to do. We are independent travellers and found ourselves unwittingly on the tourist trail. The train was empty which confirmed our suspicions that the 'train full' declaration was the beginning of the scam. The accommodation that was booked for us was substandard and we were not even told where we were staying so we could research. If you do end up at the tourist office, which is likely if you don't have prebooked tickets, ask lots of questions about the tour and don't let them railroad you into something you don't want to. I would suggest that you book tickets way in advance, perhaps book a hotel and get them to book tickets over the phone.","January 25, 2017",0.0,35.400516795865634,15.245478036175712,3.875968992248062,13.178294573643411,32.299741602067186

The present station was opened in the early 20th Century and is the major rail hub of the country. Very many commuter trains depart from here as well as the longer routes operated by Sri Lanka Railways.

The train travel and the scenery was breathtaking and the overall experience was excellent. We took the first class and the train was pretty much on time. Negative was the toilets which were smelly and not very clean. Most annoying thing was the hassle we had to go through to secure 16 tickets.

Basically, only 1st class will get you reserved seats, but you must do this in advance and through an agency - check on-line. It will cost you considerably more, but its still cheap. Otherwise, you buy a 2nd class ticket, and tickets to destinations 1-2 hours' distant are cheaper than a tube ride in London. Don't expect to get a seat, but relax - once you get on (it may seem daunting, but just move forward), settle in a place (by the doors are preferable for air and views, but between the seats is okay, too). Expect vendors and some beggars to walk around and over you - the cut pineapple and pomengranite seemed safe enough and delicious. Note: Upon returning to Colombo, passengers getting on the train will not wait for you to disembark first. Look to see where Sri Lankans are exiting and follow them. Although it can be stressful, it was a pleasure feeling the air through the open doorways. There's usually a local hanging out the door behind you, so not too much worry about falling out. It's also a great opportunity to meet other travellers.","January 12, 2017",0.0,35.400516795865634,15.245478036175712,3.875968992248062,13.178294573643411,32.299741602067186

Transportation is plentiful outside the station, by either Taxi or TukTuk. Train travel is a very convenient and cheap way to travel through Sri Lanka.  You could travel to several destinations in luxury and at a low rate using the Expo Rail. You can find a train to Kandy, Negombo, Galle, Anuradhapura, Trincomale, Baticoloa and Jaffna from here. Luxury trains with AC also are available here to serve you. Take care about your valuables from the  thieves outside the station. I have used Colombo Fort Rail station very often and it has been fine. I live in Kandy and work in Colombo and I travel home and back by trains and I have to come here as the trains start the journeys from here. Finding the correct platform and train seat was very simple.Travelling by train is comfortable and enjoyable and fast as they are not held up due to traffic. In most occasions, Ihave used this station. They will announce about the journey of the train in Sihala, Tamil and in English languages.  I have gone on train to visit many places like Kandy, Badulla, Anuradhapura, Matara and Jaffna using the Sri Lankan railway service. it is low cost and a very efficient way to view the beauty of Sri Lanka. The station has many ticket counters and all are numbered, Above all, there is a list of places they stop and the cost involved for the journey to different destinations.  There are different Numbered ticket counters for different routes and they are nicely notified by signboards. If in doubt go to counters 6 or 7 which are the inquiry counters where you can get help or even ask the schedules. We traveled on the Sri Lankan trains to Hikkaduwa, Galle, Kandy and Negombo and had no problems at all finding the train times and getting the correct trains. 500 or 1000 LKR notes are best for the ticket counters as the train prices are very cheap in Sri Lanka.There is a digital board displaying the time schedules of the trains destination at a particular time. If you travel to ""Nuwara Eliya"" you get  absolutely beautiful scenery. Cost was 2200 Rupee's in the 1st.class with meals and drinks. Took approximately  6 hours and I loved every minute of it.You'll certainly enjoy the experience. Train travel whilst in Sri Lanka is a must. Much more pleasant than catching the buses but having continuity in ticket prices and bookings does not exist. First class gives you air conditioning and generally a seat (not too crowded) but best to only have carry-on luggage. Third class is with many people as possible. Once you have your ticket go through the entrance and there is a large screen which will tell you the platform number, it changes between Sri Lanka and English every 30 seconds or so. When on the correct platform you can ask a member of staff which end of the platform the carriages for 2nd or 3rd class will arrive. Once the train starts to appear pick you bags up and get ready for the rush to the door. People rush to get into the train which is  no different to ‘rush’ hour at any station in the world. Keep your ticket as you will need to hand it in when you get off the train. The trains are heavily used in Sri Lanka so if you are slow getting on you may not have a seat. If so, and you don’t mind standing, you can stand by the open carriage doors which is a great way to see the country side pass by. You can either use the  website or instead just go to the station to book the tickets. But better to inquire beforehand the time schedule of the train to your destination if it is a long distance one. Try to get an ‘express’ train rather than a ‘slow’ train as they are slow. If you have the time and like the countryside, you must take a trip on the railways from Colombo Fort, It is worth a peek inside, if you are not traveling, there are public restrooms as well. I recommend you to start your journey from Fort station in the train to your destinations.","October 15, 2017",0.0,35.400516795865634,15.245478036175712,3.875968992248062,13.178294573643411,32.299741602067186

Given the floods I kept and eye on updates and their website. Also checked with plantation stay we had planned. The train couldn’t reach Kandy but the stop prior . That was ok for us as the hotel said they would pick us up from there. The hotel and I kept checking with the railway and the website right up to 6 hours pre departure. On arrival at the station we were informed that the trains were cancelled due to line work ! We could have got the 4am train and we could get the one at 2pm . Was told at first that the website I looked at was fake! Pointed out that it was the same site I booked and received my tickets from! Then told that they don’t update the website! Welcome to the 21st century. The still manager seemed to find it all very funny. sitting there grinning at me. What’s more the hotel informed me that tickets were still available to buy for that trip!  The railway set up is a shambles , we had looked forward to this rail trip and one of the main reasons for visiting Sri Lanka. I understand floods can’t be helped but giving false and misleading information can. We ended up having to do the the 3hr trip by taxi. The farce didn’t end there . Another trip to Galle was booked (1st class not available ) . We booked 2nd class which should have guaranteed a seat , yeah right ! Might just as well spat in the wind. Still they carried on selling 2nd class tickets . Don’t bother with the toilets either , a hole in the floor to the tracks! We travelled rail in so many countries , this is without doubt the worst.

Be focussed on not letting people direct you in different places, it really is clear. When you go in the ticket room the Jaffna desk is right over to the right.

We were quoted the correct price, given a receipt number and informed that we could pick the tickets up on arrival at the railway station. We travelled by taxi from our accommodation in Negombo, heavily laden with backpacks and additional day packs, and arrived leaving an hour before the scheduled 8.30 departure time on Good Friday March 30, 2018. After locating the appropriate ticket counter (Counter 17), we were told that there were no tickets booked for us, the receipt number was incorrect and there were no available seats on that train or any train to Kandy on that or subsequent days. As there was a line of other customers behind us, we left the counter and went to the Railway Tourist Information Office next door. The office was not yet open but a helpful person told us that we could put our bags down inside and wait for someone to help us. We accepted the offer, respite from a crowded footpath and a seat in an air conditioned office. After making his morning offerings, a man named Sampath told us that he would inquire about the availability of tickets for us. He came back some time later with the information that there were no vacancies on the 8.30 train as it was a very busy holiday, but he would see if he could get us tickets on a later train. He made one or more phone calls and told us that it would be possible to get tickets for reserved seats on the 10.30 train. After much coming and going we he returned and revealed that the seats were available only as part of a package holiday involving accommodation and drivers/guides. As we had already booked accommodation in Kandy, he ""helpfully"" put together an itinerary based on our travel plans. We were a little surprised at the quoted costs but, as new arrivals in the country and feeling trapped in Colombo on one of the busiest travel days of the year, were in a good position to be exploited. We agreed to a much shortened and cheaper version of the 15 day package that was offered. The full package cost the equivalent of (Australian) $1 700 for 15 days. This exceeded our budget and did not match our desire to plan our travel as we discovered more about the country and what we wanted to do in it. The final deal was for 2 one way tickets to Kandy, 4 nights of accommodation in Sigiriya, and a driver/guide to drive us from Kandy to Sigiriya, to our destinations for the next 4 days and back to Kandy on the last day. While we waited for the process to play out and our tickets to be obtained we observed the same scam being used on a succession of European and Asian travellers by the other officials in the Information Office. The accommodation in Sigiriya was good but the driver, while seemingly friendly, offered very limited advice or details and at every opportunity tried to persuade us to go to costly tourist attractions and buy safari and village tours, which we declined. We have since discovered that the accommodation was owned by the ""tourist information officer"" and he has been using this as his main source of bookings for a long time. This scam is well known to many within the tourism sector in Sri Lanka and is not limited to Colombo Fort Station. The cost of both the accommodation and driver were inflated, so that the 76 000 rupee ($A 654) we paid was well in excess of what we would have paid by independently booking. Stick to information from the official government tourist offices which are located at the airport and in a number of cities throughout Sri Lanka. They do not receive commissions or kick backs, offer good advice to travellers, are very well informed and put together itineraries that match your interests and allow you to see everything possible in the budget and timelines available to you. They also book you excellent  drivers that (while not seemingly cheap) have great knowledge that they enthusiastically impart. We found the accommodation bookings they arranged for us to always exceed our expectations.","May 16, 2018",0.0,35.400516795865634,15.245478036175712,3.875968992248062,13.178294573643411,32.299741602067186

At this time we decided on one thing and that was to go to Kandy by train. On arriving at the station we was pointed to the Tourist Information Centre for help obtaining our ticket. We met Prasanna who was a very good help because the train we wanted to catch was full but got us sorted on the next train in comfortable seats with air con. At this point he started talking about booking a tour through him ""we thought here we go"" After a lengthy chat and giving us some figures ""which sounded a very good deal"" we decided to book and I'm glad we did. We would have never been able to see as much of Sri Lanka so easily without this tour. It was arranged for our driver to pick us up from our hotel in Kandy and that he did. This is when we met Lahiru Dissanayaka our driver and tour companion for 5 days. Lahiru was an absolute godsend and became a very good friend over them 5 days. We saw everything possible in the time we had and Lahiru's knowledge of the places we visited was exceptional. We saw everything we could from our Kandy City tour on our first day. Kandy to Nuwara Eliya on our second day. Nuwara Eliya to Matale, Dambulla and Sigiriya on our third. A jeep Safari at Polonnaruwa ""we saw so many elephants, it was a beautiful sight"" and all the ancient ruins on our fourth. On our fifth day Lahiru took us from Sigiriya to the drop off point of our choice which was a long trek to Trincomalee seeing and stopping at some beautiful sights on our way. It was sad to see Lahiru go and I would highly recommend Rail Tours to see all the beautiful sights of Sri Lanka at a very good price.

The way to enjoy it is to just go with the flow.  The station itself is easy to find and all tuk-tuk drivers know where it is. The station has many ticket counters, all numbered, and above which is a list of places they stop and the cost.  If in doubt go to counters 6 or 7 which are the inquiry counters where you can get help.  We travelled on the Sri Lankan trains to Hikkaduwa, Galle, Kandy and Negombo and had no problems at all finding the train times and getting the correct trains.  500 or 1000 LKR notes are best for the ticket counters as the train prices are very cheap in Sri Lanka.  Once you have your ticket go through the entrance and there is a large screen which will tell you the platform number, it changes between Sri Lanka and English every 30 seconds or so. When on the correct platform you can ask a member of staff which end of the platform the carriages for 2nd or 3rd class will arrive.  Once the train starts to appears pick you bags up and get ready for the rush to the door.  There will not be any manners shown, so it will be every man, woman and child for yourself. (No different to ‘rush’ hour at any station in the world).  Keep your ticket as you will need to hand it in when you get off the train. The trains are heavily used in Sri Lanka so if you are slow getting on you may not have a seat.  If so, and you don’t mind standing, you can stand by the open carriage doors which is a great way to see the country side pass by.

We got to the train station with about 40 mins to spare for our train at 10.30 from Colombo to Galle. It was easy to get a ticket and cost us each 180 for second class tickets. The guy at the platform told us which platform to go to as our train hadn’t even appeared on the board. Once on the train it was very busy and we ended up standing for the first hour but luckily people got off at different stations and we got a seat eventually. The train ride is about 2 and a bit hours, it’s not that comfortable and the toilet is basically a hole that goes straight on the tracks which we found to be an experience in its self 😂. Once at Galle, it is good to look when the trains are back the next day. It’s not a trip you can do in a day as the last train back seems to be around 3/4pm. Many people try to help you saying they work at the station but usually they do help but then have another agenda e.g. then try get you to take a taxi with them. On our way back to Colombo we ended up getting the bus back as we would have had to wait 2 hours for the train and we both we’re not looking forward to the journey again. Some men tried to get us to get in a taxi for 5000 which seemed cheap but in comparison to the train ticket it is not. In the end we just went to the bus station to ask and found a bus straight away the price was 340 each to get to Colombo which we took as we were confirmed seats, air con and was definitely a more comfort drive. We asked if we could get dropped off earlier then Colombo as we would have driven past our accommodation and it was fine to do that. It may take an hour longer to get to each destination but definitely more comfortable and I would recommend looking at getting the bus both ways.","July 3, 2018",0.0,35.400516795865634,15.245478036175712,3.875968992248062,13.178294573643411,32.299741602067186

Not the entire way, but until a good many people got off. It seemed like a typical experience. No one seemed surprised, and other reviewers mention it, too, in their reviews. The train station is in about the same area as the bus station, which makes for major traffic congestion, depending on when you go. The good news is this was the most annoying train station (I think) we encountered in Sri Lanka, so if you successfully maneuver this obstacle, it's downhill all the way.","October 1, 2015",0.0,35.400516795865634,15.245478036175712,3.875968992248062,13.178294573643411,32.299741602067186

It was built in 1908 and did not appear to have had any upgrading work done. I was told it had 10 platforms and steps and a bridge connecting to these. One modern aspect is the display screen but one could not trust whether the information was accurate. It was very noisy, sometimes painful to the ear as each train entered and left the platform. One could hardly hear the other speaking. Maybe I am old and sensitive to this noise. There were security/ticket checkers sitting at entry and exit points. However it was easy to push through the crowds and enter the station without any checking. Inside the station, there were some seats but not enough for the number of passengers waiting. Our train was to Jaffna leaving at 5.45 am. I wanted to check something about my ticket. There were no information or ticket counters inside. However there was a room where several men were seated behind their desks. There were no computers, everything done manually. If you expect western standards you may think the men were not interested and unhelpful. However, this is the way it seems things are in Srilanks, there are no queues and people tend to push with the 'me first' attitude. I did get my answers to my questions but also advice that one of the trains I had booked my return journey was a slow train taking 10 hours.

We got dropped off by the tuk tuk at the back of the station and directed around the front to the ticket counters. In our daze and confusion we were beckoned into the tourist information centre and relaxed thinking we were about to receive some help and direction. However, what we got was some guy making what I have come to believe is a bogus phone call to check on train tickets for us to Anuradapura. He then proceeded to offer us a package deal including driver and accommodation for £70 a day!!! He showed receipts from other travellers before us and everything. We were hesitant so were encouraged to check trip advisor because he has nothing but excellent reviews. Jokes on him, scam scam scam. We declined and we are so glad we did. We got seated tickets on our desired train and, despite him telling us the Kandy-Ella train was fully booked, we got standing tickets on the day. Avoid the tourist information guy, the train station itself is fine.
