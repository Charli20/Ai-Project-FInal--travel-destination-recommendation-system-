Thus, from an archeological perspective, the place would get 3 stars. But considering it as a stop over on the way to Jaffna and the very easy access, being literally on the side of a main road I would give it 3.5 half stars. The main attraction today is the newer stupa built atop a rock outcrop and the 360 degree view it offers. There is a car park on the side of the road and a few smalls kiosks from where you can get tea and cold, fresh local orange juice mixed with a sprinkling of pepper (ideal on a hot day). From there you can climb up to the stupa. For the most part there are no steps but the slope is quite gentle and it's a short, easy climb. But do keep your shoes on until you get to the stupa, as the rock can get quite hot during the day. According to the monk we met at the top, the new stupa has been constructed on the site of an old Stupa destroyed by the Britishes who built a lookout post there. Nothing remains today of the old Buddhist constructions, expect for a Budhha's footprint carved in stone kept near the stupa (and a cobra head carved in stone which we couldn't find). The stories attached to the place comes more from folklore than any archeological or historical evidence and are both based on a translation of the Sinhala name given to the place. One version is that this is a place where ""isiwara"" or sages lived. Other version is that Arhat Mahinda (son of Indian Emperor Asoka who brought Budhdhism to Sri Lanka) arrived here by ""iridi"" power (I suppose you can say it's something like teleporting) before arriving at Mihintale where he would go on to meet King Devanampiyatissa. [Mihintale is not too far from here and in fact you can clearly see the two white Stupas at Mihintale from atop this rock.] According to this version, it is King Devanampiyatissa who constructed the Stupa here. There is a small building towards the back of the stupa. From there, there is a set of newly constructed steps that lead down to the temple premises. As we had done zero research before visiting we climbed back down the way we came. And then we asked around how to get to the temple....! So, based on the directions we got from the kiosks, we took the vehicle down the right turn you get just before the A9 Road entrance to Isinbessagala (this is coming from Anuradhapura side). It's a dirt road but was in very good condition and you have to drive only about 500 meters to get the temple. On the way there, you would another small Stupa on the side of the road, obviously of ancient origin recently conserved. Then you get to a quite well to do temple, with a several new constructions, right next to an ancient tank (wewa). The image house built in the 1930s - 1940s had some interesting statues and paintings. If you climb up to the rock from the temple you also come across quite a sizable banyan tree and an ancient cave dwelling (which is still in use), but we didn't have time to explore these as we were in a hurry to get back on the road. Must also mention that, when we got down from the vehicle wearing only socks, the monks told us to keep wearing shoes (probably because of the heat) which I thought was very considerate of them.","September 30, 2024",0.0,18.181818181818183,0.0,0.0,18.181818181818183,63.63636363636363
