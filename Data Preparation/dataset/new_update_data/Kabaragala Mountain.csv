The scenary from atop on a clear day is the reason for it being high on the list of dedicated hikers. An easy climb once you're through the tea Estate and the panorama would compel an hour's stay. Be watchful walking the path along the ridge as some parts are very much on the edge of the steep precipice. Leech activity is to be expected. Be careful climbing up/down the thickly covered savannah in the incline as you would not see where you are about to put your feet. Take time climbing due to this issue. Please bring back all that you take and help bring back what's left by the irresponsible and ignorant.,"September 29, 2023",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,66.66666666666666,33.33333333333333

Few folks who you might along the way is all you need to find the foothill of the steep incline through the savanah all the way up until l the view point .Time to the top is under 2 hours even by a senior citizen. Yes the trek is ok for a senior.Watch out for few leeches during the wet season though. View from the top is GOOD in the highest sense. Take extra care if you feel like walking up to the highest point since some parts of the path is bit too close to the precipice. And the view from the very top is second  to what you get to see at the first view point so you might as well decide to not try the summit.. BRING EVERYTHING BACK.INCLUDING THE WHAT'S LEFT BY THE IDIOTS .PLEASE.","April 20, 2023",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,66.66666666666666,33.33333333333333

The hike takes one along various types of terrain,right through a mountain village and finally up a savanna type grassy slope to the first view point for breath taking views of the valley below. A journey along the ridge from the first view point would take the traveler to the summit. Public Transport to the foothills is available from both Gampola and Nawalapitiya. The first view point of the mountain could be reached within just 2 hours after starting the climb. Path is clear till the edge of the village and from then onward its savanna with the trees at the top of the hill  clearly visible .Road to Craighead, at the start of the trail is in good condition .Expect a degree of leech activity during the rainy season.","May 19, 2019",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,66.66666666666666,33.33333333333333
