I first visited more than 50 years ago with my parents and siblings. In those days, the drive, in a car without air conditioning or power steering, on a rutted road, took more than two days. We made overnight stops at Kalaoya and A’pura. The trip was dangerous, because from Puttalam, we traveled through thick forest, inhabited by elephants, leopard, and bear. We recited the rosary and sang hymns. The forest is gone now, except for the reservation around the shrine. The shrine itself was damaged during the civil war, but has been lovingly restored by the army. It’s a beautiful structure. The area can be very crowded during the various feasts throughout the year, but on the weekday I visited, hardly 20 visitors were around. Accomodation consits of small houses built by families, which they occupy during visits, but are rented out by the shrine authoritiies to other visitors when they are vacant. I was disaapointed to see that these houses appared to be in a state of neglect. I certainly wouldn’t  think of staying overnight at one of these houses. Instead, at stayed at the Palmyrah Garden Hotel, which I have reviewed on Tripadvisor. The shrine is well worth a visit.

Now, it’s being a very popular church and a most visited pilgrim among the catholic population around Sri Lanka. Also, visited by tourist regardless the religions, ethnics, nationalities  and so on… The services/mass are conducted in both the native languages (Tamil & Sinhalese) in the mornings and the evenings. The special festival season is in August and the final festival is on the 15th of August. During this period the area is crowed and the church is filled with pilgrims, which makes the visit of the church a highly busy. So, better avoid this period to visit here. Pilgrims can rent accommodation around the church for a very reasonable price. Eating around is a challenge. (The food available in the canteen adjoining the church is not up to the mark and a bit over priced for what you get. But, it’s a clean and comfortable place to sit and have something to eat.)

If you're not particularly interested in religion, then it's a nice place to visit, but. The shrine itself is pretty enough, very well maintained (the Church is the largest landowner in the District, and one of the richest organizations on the island) and important as a critical battlefield site during the civil war. The raison d'etre is a small statue of the Virgin Mary, high atop the altar. The statue itself has a long and storied history in Sri Lanka, and so is famous. In-and-of-itself, it isn't much to look at, but then appearance is not what makes it importance. If you are Roman Catholic, or have a particular interest in Sri Lankan history and culture, you must visit the site. The casual tourist might be interested in stopping at Madhu for a half hour or so if passing through, but I wouldn't make it a goal. It all depends on your motivation for going.","December 30, 2013",0.0,10.126582278481012,2.5316455696202533,5.063291139240507,22.78481012658228,59.49367088607595

We had a big ""?"" mark regarding the hygiene factor of the food because of this enormous amount of flies.
