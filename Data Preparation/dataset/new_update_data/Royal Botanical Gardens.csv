The roads/paths aren’t marked on the map, and there’s no indication of the location of the flora featured on the pages adjacent to the map.  Some plants are labeled; most are not.  And the labels are pretty useless.  A large plot of dahlias, for example, are simply described as dahlias, no indication of the specific cross or the name of each plant.  It’s even worse in the orchid house, where the labels that would indicate the cross of the orchids, even the species name, are neatly hidden, and visitors are specifically admonished not to touch the plant labels.

It is approx. 15 mins from Kandy city to here by tuk tuk and the fare should cost about 5 GBP. If you have already been on a tuk tuk with a mad driver then you will understand what an 'experience' this is, and if you haven't then do try to experience this at least once in your travels !","January 30, 2019",0.25,43.25,4.25,1.25,17.0,34.0

Those with an inclination towards plant studies will have a great time exploring the garden as it has a lot of variety of plantation. We loved the greenery and beautiful flower garden. To my surprise we have seen a double coconut tree inside the garden and same dried one is for display in a museum inside premises. You can spend entire day if you wish to in a calm and beautiful garden. Please note it has an entry fee. I'll suggest to improve on the direction maps so people can explore their interest due to limited time being a tourist.,"July 24, 2019",0.25,43.25,4.25,1.25,17.0,34.0
