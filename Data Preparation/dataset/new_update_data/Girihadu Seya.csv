In the Buddhist tradition, the Sangha can only possess what the community provides; and you will see that there is very little (either way) at Girihandu. Please... take a big sack of 'Rice', a big box of 'First Aid' supplies and donation money as 'dana' for the devoted and welcoming keepers, of this inspiring, sacred location. Karmically positive deeds, lead to a greater happiness. The history of the site is fascinating and the 'Akasa Stupa' is a really beautiful ruin. However, remains a very active monastic place of worship and veneration. The hilltop setting provides a stunning outlook in all directions. The stairway climb to the top isn't so arduous. In fact it's a very pretty and idyllic walk. Tiriyaya is a rugged and isolated paradise. It took a couple of hours to arrive by way of three wheeler, hired via the Guest house in Trincomalee. It's a 50km journey (100km in total) from Trincomalee Central Bus station. The journey out; at first light, was transformative. There is quite a bit of information available online regarding the site and its history. If in 'Trinco'... then put it on your list of things to do. An enjoyable 'fringe experience'... literally","March 18, 2015",0.0,20.0,10.0,0.0,20.0,50.0

It is a short climb but the some steps are uneven so you have to be mindful if you are travelling with kids or with elderly. There is a place to buy snacks and drinks at the place where you can park your vehicle.
