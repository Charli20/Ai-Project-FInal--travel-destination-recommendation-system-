After the tour we were given a cup of tea and encouraged to buy tea from the shop. Far too commercialise.

I too thought the same. I have being to many tea factories in my life. But the Pedro tea factory itself is different. The building structure is unique and as explained by my Friend Nadun Madushan, the Assistant Manager, it is built in the style of an Chocolate Factory. In order to maintain a high standard of quality, tea manufacturing is done only during the night when the weather is colder. Therefore, the action is very low during the day time. But don't be worried there are plenty of staff who are well trained to take you on a guided tour on how tea is manufactured. Due to security reasons the management doesn't allow anyone to take photographs inside the premises. Their tea boutique is also a very cozy place to visit and have a nice cup of tea and purchase whatever the flavor you wish to have. And over looking the tea boutique is the lovely scenery of the tea estate. Time spent here is very relaxing and memorable.

Tickets comes with a free cup of tea which is free to enjoy before or after the tour. Boutique's clean and well maintained ambiance was so relaxing and offer a perfect view of the greeny tea estate. There was a fair collection of Ceylon tea to be purchased. However, lesser verities. Didn’t see a large collection of flavoured or infused teas. Reason may be this place only sells the pure tea straight from their factory without any infusions or additions. Only pure tea as it is. “Lover’s Leap”, the Boutique got this name in reference to a nearby waterfall with the same name. Supposedly the name was given after an ancient prince and his lover leapt into death from the particular waterfall. Tour was fairly short since the factory is small (just about 10-15 minutes).

We had wanted to do the factory tour and were told on our arrival that we weren’t able to because the factory wasn’t open for visitors that day (oddly). We were told that the only two activities we could do where the two (more expensive at 1100 Rs pp) “experiences” of Tea tasting or Tea picking; we opted for the tea tasting. We said we understood that the factory was closed for tours but asked if it would be possible to pop our heads round to see the inside of the factory? The woman said yes. So we sat down for our tea tasting, and after 10 minutes a tray of tea was plonked in front of us, a different woman pointed and said some teas were strong and others weren’t, and then departed(!) There was no explanation about the variations of tea on the tray, how they are grown, or what they were even! Nothing. Nada. We were just left to our tray of random teas. It was an absolute joke. We tried to find someone to ask questions but got minimal information and no actual explanation on the process. We then said asked if we could have a quick look round the door at the factory, and the woman in charge said “yes that’s fine, that’ll be Rs.350 each” i.e. the cost of the tour which we had initially asked for and were told that we couldn’t do!! I queried why we were told merely 15 minutes earlier that we couldn’t do the tour of the tea factory, at which point the woman basically lied to us and claimed she had included it as an option!! She was basically scoffing at us as she spoke implying that all 3 of us had misunderstood. The Sri Lankan driver who had driven us there and was waiting and had heard the whole thing was as shocked as we were at the audacity of this woman. (And won’t be recommending anyone go there again).

Firstly when we arrived noone greeted us, the staff all ignored us and it was really unclear where we were supposed to go. We figured out we had to buy tickets and were then told to wait 10 minutes until the tour started. We waited 30 minutes without any further communication about the tour. Another staff member did give us a cup of tea but with no explanation, we weren't really sure if it was actually supposed to be for us. We chose a table to sit at, but they were all very dirty with bits of food and flies and dishes unclear from previous guests. Finally our tour guide came to get us for our tour, she was very unenthusiastic and came across as in a hurry and disinterested. During the tour, our guide was very rude to other guests in our group. The guide's accent was a bit hard to understand at the best of times (not her fault as English is her second language), but she told two members of our tour group (who English was also not their first language for) that taking photos was not allowed. They clearly did not hear her/understand what was being said, and instead of gently making sure they understood, she yelled at them ""do you even speak English?!"". After the tour was finished she just walked off without saying goodbye or thanks or anything. Such a bad experience from start to finish! The previous day we did a tour at Damro and it was amazing!

It was a precise and concise tour of 20 mts where they take you through each division of the factory while explaining the tea making process from end to end.

We went there around 10.30 am and immediately joined a tour that was just about to start. After the tour you get a nice cup of tea. (I think there are tours every half an hour.)

We paid LKR 500 each and I think it was the same for locals and foreigners. No photos or videos are allowed inside the factory. [If I am nitpicking, the aprons they provide visitors to wear during the tour can do with a makeover.] We Also learnt that the name of the Estate is pronounced as ""Peedro"" (not ""Pedro"")  same as how the British colonists called ""Piduruthalaga"" the highest mountained ""Mount Pedro"", pronounced as ""Mount Peedro"". The factory is quite close to Nuwara Eliya town. Road conditions are good. It's on the side of the Udupussellawa road and there is ample parking inside the property.

The employee guided us in the fast-track max. 15 minutes through the factory. She spoke very good English, but she rattled down the information as if memorized, so you could hardly follow. In the end, there was no tea tasting, the real reason we had visited the factory in the first place. On request, it was said that there were currently no more samples. Milk was also no longer in stock. Too bad!","October 28, 2024",0.0,43.0,4.75,1.25,19.0,32.0
