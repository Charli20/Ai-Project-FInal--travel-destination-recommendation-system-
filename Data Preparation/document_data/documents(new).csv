Aluvihara Rock Cave Temple,"Aluvihara Rock Cave Temple. We went there at the middle of our travel, mean that we already have done, dambulla, sigiriya, trincomalee and anuradhapura... so yes, this temple seems to be useless... 3 caves (small) with differents kind of torture that gods can do when you're a sinner... actually it could be interresting, but finally we didn't enjoy so much... An amazing Buddhist Temple built into a mountain under a cliff overhang. This is one to see as it's so different in its design and placement. The inside is highly painted in Buddhist features and  Buddhas abound in each room. I stay meditate, learn Tipitaka writing on Ola leaves in this campus. Food was arrnaged to me by the Abbot and his associates The five caves are accessed by walking up around 300 steps, the walk is manageable by most and you are free to go at your own pace. The view from the top of the surrounding area is impressive and the caves themselves are fairly impressive however I have seen a lot of Buddhist temples and they are all very similar these are no more impressive than most. Few things to note - make sure you buy a ticket prior to going up the steps, take water as surprisingly there is none available to buy at the grounds, cover your knees and shoulders otherwise you will not be allowed to enter the caves this includes both men and women. At the top of the steps before entering the caves you will be told to leave your shoes for a charge and he will say you are not allowed to carry them however we just put them in our bag and had no problem with this also there is some walking to do once you remove your shoes so may be handy to take socks as the ground is really hot and burnt our feet!! Lots of monkeys around who aren't phased by humans but also caused no problems during our visit. Around 160 MT high rock temple situated in natural caves having reclining Buddha statues. Caves are having paintings on walls & ceilings of  different eras crafted by different kings. Excellent place to visit. It takes around 1 hr to climb and back. This is a small temple complex on our way to Kandy from Polonnaruwa. There is a series of small cave temples mostly with paintings which are in pretty good condition, as are the statues, which probably means they have been extensively reconstructed or are relatively new works. Consequently, they don’t look anywhere as old as they should be. There is an entry fee to the complex but unfortunately, some of the individual caves will demand additional payment as well. It’s not an essential stop, especially if you plan to visit the other main temple sites in Sri Lanka, but there were not many other tourists around, so it can be a good place for a  peaceful and contemplative hour. It was very interesting to see the wall paintings of the Buddhist hell, for the sexual sinners. Something I would have never thought I would see. Fascinating. The cave temples are definitely worth the visit, but be sure you have a knowledgable guide with you. We asked one of the cave employees to show us around, and he provided so much information that other groups left their guides to join ours. Beautiful and unique. It was so good to be back at this place after a year away. The Temple involves quite a climb and the rock gets very hot in the sun so early morning visits are best. It was built in the 3rd century BCE when the King built the Dagoba and planted the Bo tree. during his reign, Buddhism was introduced to the country and this Temple is the place where the Pali Canon was first written down in text on palm leaves. It has caves with ancient inscriptions plus wall and ceiling paintings and statues and images of the Lord Buddha. A contrast to Dambulla and not as well known Well worth visiting for its great artwork and the location Much less touristic than Dambulla The pictures of the fate of wrongdoing in the second temple are brilliant Aluviharaya, a rock cave temple which has cave writings dating back to BCE. During the reign of king Walagambha, Tripitaka was written on ola (palm) leaves. That is first time, the Tripitaka was written. You can find more details on that on internet. There's museum which exhibits the traditional writing methods and tools used. Also you can see a preserved version of Tripitaka which was re-written in 1980s. As a rock cave temple it has a historical value because this is one of the earliest evidence of civilizations in upcountry Sri Lanka. (Not per-historic). There's small cliff which you can climb without much effort. At the top you can see surrounding mountains. Scenery is not that special. From Matale town, it is only 5 minutes drive towards Dambulla. Can use public transport as well. Plenty of buses are working. If you are a Buddhist pilgrim, it is an important place to worship because of the Tripitaka writings. If you are a history lover, think about the ancient technology used to write on Ola leaves. Those are the earliest evidences of proper writing systems in Asian history. If you are a linguist, think about the styles of Sinhala scripts, how well Sinhala language is structured. There is plenty of parking space available. Not crowded during weekdays. Crowds are gathering during poya days to observe sil. Also not much crowded during weekends. You need to have modest dress because this is a Buddhist religious place. Walk up the steps take your time and soak in the atmosphere, because you'll be glad you did just to see and hear the amazing sights and sounds - Well worth a visit We stopped here and were not expecting much considering how much we liked the Dambulla caves. But what an unexpected surprise! The place seems to be less famous and so to light up the caves we were given a portable fluorescent lamp. But the caves were really worth it and we were especially impressed by the painting depicting the Maras (demons) inflicting their terror. The place was very well maintained for a very reasonable entry ticket. Worth a visit! A must visit as part of SL ruins\historical sites. The hike to the caves is not too difficult. As with all places, early morning climb is recommended as it gets hotter after 10 AM. Carry your own food and water. The kings route from ticket counter is easier and quicker than the other hike. The paintings and sculptures are very impressive and reminds one of Ajantha caves. This is a temple about 30 kilometres noth of Kandy, just beyond Matale. It's built on a hill, and not as well known as the ones at Dambulla. Because of this, there are hardly any visitors, and you can wander around peacefully without guards hustling you. The cave temples have some nice carved statues and wall murals, but the importance of this place is that it was where the teachings of the Budhha were first written down, after five hundred years of word of mouth teaching. Unfortunately, the library was mostly destroyed in the nineteenth century when the British were suppressing a rebellion. This wonderful place did not require us to buy tickets or pay anything for parking the car. Many stories about the temple, But I really like the places where the Buddhist monks were residing and doing the writings. Many tourist miss this as they will be shown only the main caves with images and not the caves other side of the temple. Explore it. its part of the Dambulla cave temples and its as good to visit as otheres... if you climbing all the way up you might as well check this ones out.. The rock temple at Dambulla was much better than I expected.Its a bit of a hard walk up the stairs and there is an entrance fee of 1500rp.Lots of monkeys everywhere at the top and a fee to have your shoes stored.The ground gets really hot on bare feet but they have small rugs to walk on.The temples are divided into rooms and depending on when you get there each room can be packed full and difficult to move around.Very humid inside too.The statues,frescoes and all the art work where’s great and much better than I expected.Well Worth the visit.On the way down you can visit the Golden Buddha statue at the bottom but that is a bit of a disappointment and tacky. Beautiful golden budha. Nice and clean site with an amazing view from the top. You can see the monkeys from really close walking up. (About 10-15 mins to the top) Caves were nice with the paintings and the statues but site was crowed. Entrance fee 1500 roupies. Not a must do for me but if you're in the area why not? This is very famous temple in Matale. You can visit the temple in 1 hour (max) If you go early you can visit all without a rush due to low crowd. Go enjoy the stories and different statues. And its for everyone whi is interested about history. So why not stop over on the way to Dambulla. Historic value is there in this cave temple too. Its different and worth the visit. As an experienced travelers, this sight is our most recommended Buddhist temple in Sri Lanka. About 270 stairs to get up there. This is a traditional and very important temple in sri lanka.its very important to buddhism.i visit with my family in poya day.its was crowded.its a rock ancient rock temple. The climb up the granite stairs is stepp and takes about 15 minutes if you keep moving and don't stop to take photos with the many monkeys that will greet you along the way. Yes there is an admission charge as with all attractions in Sri Lanka it seems. Luckily it was not crowded during our visit and we could take the time to enjoy the view from the top and spend as much time as we wanted in each of the 5 caves. As with most attractions it helps if you read up on the history of the site first so as to fully appreiate how the carvings and painting came about in the caves. We skipped the museum part as it has a serperate fee and we had been told it was underwhelming. The enormous golden Buddha above the museum entrance is quite impressive and makes for good photo ops, although one should not pose with their back to the Buddha, try sidways instead out of respect. This is another cave temple in between Dambulla and Kandy, but smaller scale as compared to Dambulla Golden Cave Temple and less tourists here. Lower entrance fee of LKR300 per person, but underwhelming effect as compared to Dambulla Golden Temple. It would be interesting if visiting this temple first, followed by Dambulla Golden Temple for the build up/ elevation effect of the overall impression. Some of the wall paintings focus on the after life depiction (which we didn’t take picture), such as punishment in hell (after life) which made us rather uncomfortable level. Hence, it was an average impression/ experience for us, especially after visiting Dambulla Golden Temple. A beautiful statue on a rock on the top of the hill which is 400-500m away from Aluvihara Cave Temple. You may witness a bird-eye view of Matale area along with a picturesque view of a group of mountains. The road is good enogh to get closer to the statue by a vehicle and then have to walk around 100m to enter to the premises. Never miss to visit this place Aluvihare Rock Temple was the historic location where the Buddha's teachings was first written down completely in text on ola (palm) leaves. This was done  In the 1st Century B.C., during King Walagamba's time. It's a nice little train ride from Kandy (1 1/2 hours each way). And, it's nice being where the Tipitaka was written into Pali.  But the caves/scenes are nothing spectacular or essential.  There are some lifesize 'sinners'  made of plaster (I think) behind cages and a few more original/older wall murals.  It was annoying that the 'guardians' expected extra tips/donations to go inside each cave site - the only place I experienced that in Sri Lanka.  I didn't go to Dambulla, but I'm sure it's a much more rewarding experience (and I've been through temples/caves throughout SE Asia). This temple is a very old temple situated in mathale area. There are caves in this temple. While you visit there you can cover dambulla temple also sometimes you feel not another temple!! this was so different well worth the walk the buddhas are superb and the way the temple has been created is astonishing It is in my home town and it is a very religious place built by king Walagamba. You still can observe ancient ruins built in that era. Also you can visit the Buddha Statue on the mountain behind. On the road from Kandy to Dambulla, just 1,5 km past Matale, there is this weird temple on the left side of the road. The temple complex and statues are not very different from many others in Sri Lanka, but the paintings in one of the rock temples are! Her the buddhist hell is depicted in a very graphic way. Better be a devout buddhist, because things that happen to you when in buddhist hell are beyond description, but very clear in the numerous murals. You are not supposed to take pictures, but it is worth taking the risk. It is a nice stop on the road north, and the ice cream sold on the parking is good at only 50 rupees. Really worth exploring Enchanting and really spectacular and free Views are also majestic and a great intro into cave temple rock religious history The temple was built by king Devanampiyatissa in 3rd century B.C During reign of  king valagamba  in 1st century B.C . philosophical  Doctrine of buddhist  was written  by 500 monks  on ola leaves . during day time and night  time .  the villagers were looked light from temple during night  Therefore  they called as a aloka lena  [ cave of light]   after its called alu lena  finally  alu viharaya   . This is a cave temple  and monastery On the way to dambulla we stopped at Matale and were pleasantly surprised. A nice complex of cave temples after a small climb up some stairs. Dambulla like caves only smaller and much quieter. No hasslers trying to sell you stuff. Worth a visit while passing for interesting small hour. Only drawback is that some caves show devilish toture depictures. We were driving from Kandy to Dambulla and the road goes through Matale. A quick stop made at the Aluvihara Temple which stands out like a beacon in an otherwise rural area. This is a historic Temple for Buddhism where one can observe the ""Theravada"" Preachings of Buddha. Heaven and Hell are depicted in terms of some of the caricatures. Plenty of steps to climb to enter the Caves and not an exercise for those not physically fit. I had already planned to visit The Dambulla Cave Temple the next day so this visit was brief. we visit this temple to see the amazing buddha statues and the history this temple has. well preserved clay and rock statues. These caves were carved out of the granite rocks.  Once you have climbed a large staircase there are fantastic views over the surrounding countryside. Caves have some amazing wall paintings - particularly graphic are the pictures of Hell. Now a UNESCO Heritage site these caves give a massive insight into life 2000 years ago. These rock temples have been used by Buddhist monks as their dwelling places in ancient Sri Lanka. A must visit place for those interested in caves. The history of Aluvihare Rock Temple begins with the reign of King Devanampiyatissa, in the 3rd century BC. The temple has many caves with ancient inscriptions, newish ceiling paintings and impressive statues and images of Buddha. The main cave contains a large reclining statue of Buddha, together with standing and seated images, while in the entrance-way of another cave with a reclining statue of Buddha there are some strange and terrifying depictions of the hellish afterlife that awaits people who commits sins - images that I've seen in Christian churches, but never in a Buddhist temple before. There were no other tourists at the time of our visit, it was quiet and we took our time.. It's an interesting place, very much worth your visit.... Don't get me wrong, it is interesting, but the both the frescos, whilst unusual, and the reclining Buddhas did not seem terrible ancient to me. The view from the top is nice. The museum nothing to write home about. Similar in style to Dambulla, although not as spectacular, this temple was worth visiting for the experience of having very few tourists. We were certainly the only western tourists at the time we visited, and this made the experience quite different from Dambulla with its crowds. One thing I did not quite expect was the graphic images and statues, one cave in particular I would not recommend for kids, we had our 2 and 4 year olds with us, and we had to cover their eyes as we walked through, they were really quite graphic! Apart from this it was still worth a pleasant ramble through the area. It's not part of most tour routes, we had to ask to go there. I'm not sure the entry price but I believe very cheap. Sri Lanka has a special place in Theravada Buddhism because of the written scriptures stored in this temple. The original writings were destroyed by the British and new writings on ola leaves were done by the monks who had committed all these  sutras to memory. There is so much history to this temple and it is recommended that one goes with a guide. Temple also has impressive paintings and statues of the Buddha and his disciples. One has to remove shoes and hats and then climb hot cement/stone stairs to get to the top. It also gives a nice view of the area from the top. At the end of the tour one gets to see how writings are done on ola leaves, which is quite interesting. A little souvenir of the guests' names on a piece of ola leaves is also a nice touch. It is well worth a visit when passing through Matale to add to your knowledge of Theravada Buddhism. This situated near to Matale town and it is a important religious place for Buddhists. There you can see rock caves and ancient paintings of great culture the temple Aluwihara is a amazing place with rock caves and its beautiful ancient wall paintings.very historical temple with srilanka's great history. Cool and calm place with Buddhist environment. This is a ancient Buddhist temple with long history. Every one visit Sri Lanka must visit Aluvihara Rock Temple Fascinating Buddas and wall paintings on plaster on the walls of the cave. It was busy even though we went in the early morning to avoid the heat and crowds. The cool inside was very welcome. The sense of peace was a delight. Would recommend seeing. Interesting and nice place to visit, impressive how the temple is built in the rocks. Just make sure not to buy flowers at the entrance The climb is challenging but absolutely feasible and when you get to the temple I am sure you will be happy and satisfied. It is definitely a temple to see and enjoy. The Aluvihara Temple in Matale is around 30km from Kandy town and is one of the many Buddhist Temples of Sri Lanka that are well worth visiting and which are of historic significance. The history of the place dates to the 3rd century BCE when the King built the dagoba and planted the bo tree. It is of importance because it is believed that the first Buddhist scriptures were documented here in Pali. The statues and carvings are exquisite. One needs to be reasonably fit for this place as there are steps to climb for accessing it. Aluvihare cave temple is an ancient temple located in Matale alongside Matale Dambulla road. It's quite an important place not only given the cave atmosphere but also the process of literature which brought 'Thripitakaya' of Buddhism's three volumes of teaching in to scripts. The first of it's kind in written. The materials used and the process done are very interesting facts to learn. I think that if you are passing this place, you should stop by  and savour that atmosphere, it is a very nice place and the paintings are very beautiful and they can have an effect on your children:-) This had the feel of a disused theme park- shabby and slightly sad. Not much going on here and in a poor state of repair. Go to the Dumbulla Rock Caves and Golden Temple instead . this is the place where holy ""canon""or ""thripitakaya"" fore the first time.it was happen over 1500 years ago A holy and thrilling experience to see such a great temple carver into a rock. Need a little energy to climb the steep rock. Photography is prohibited inside the temple, but a must visit place inside Srilanka. One of the last place in Sri lanka where Pure ""Theravada” Buddha Preaching were documented. This place is surrounded by green mountain ranges and forests, a good place for people who loves “Lord Buddha’s” memories and for hikers and nature lovers who like to adventure the rural srilankan hillside(please make sure to travel in the cooler climate times so you enjoy your self). And good site to glimpse the castigation of those who sinned, in hell, this temple contains few life size figurines of demons carrying out the punishments to those who passed on to the afterlife who had sin in there human life time,  something like “KAWATA-YAMUNE”. Tranquil temple to in the hill country . Ancient temple. This temple is enriched with splendid wall arts. It stands in a beautiful and serene atmosphere.  But security is low. The day of our visit there were wasps so we never did the climb but the area in itself is truly interesting More cheap (only 250rs) smaller but not so touristic. Beauty of the caves like dambulla. Not so many steps to take as well An incredible series of monastic caves among the rocks.  The first cave had a 30 foot long reclining Buddha and colorful painted lotus-pattern murals on the ceiling. Another had murals of the punishment for sins in hell – very graphic, and somewhat disturbing.  Took stairs to the top of the rock bluff w/ beautiful view and a group of 5 playful monkeys, including a couple babies.  Very spiritual place, but caves were not very well let, so was dificult to see. Liked that it was much more intimate and less crowded than the Dambulla caves, but if you only have time to do one, I'd definitely do Dambulla - so impressive. it's a religious place and please be calm and wear a fine dress ,some photos were not allowed inside Matale Aluvihare is a significant historical and religious site located in Matale, a town in central Sri Lanka, about 25 kilometers from Kandy. The Aluvihare rock temple is an important Buddhist temple with deep historical roots, especially known for its connection to the preservation of Buddhist scriptures. Worth the stop if you pass on the road from Kandy to Sigiriya or Polonaruwa. The temple is really close to the main road. A peaceful place with statues and beautiful paints in the caves. Much of this will be a highly personal and, thus, subjective call -- but I found the dripping, humid cave temples to be artistically and spiritually fascinating, more so than most other Sri Lankan temples I've seen on this trip. Went early, though, before the crowds, and that was undoubtedly part of the experience. Didn't mind the price of entrance this time around. Seeing the monkeys there was a plus. A unique and an important place. Unique because it has a number of boulders and caves. Important temple for buddhists. Near the Matale town Kandy - Dambulla main road wit easy access. Not so touristic compare with some other ancient Buddhist temples under the Cultural trangle. But relate with a long and most highlight part of the first documentation of Buddhism in Srilanka. Aluvihare is one of the most important cultural sites in Sri Lanka.It was believed to be, Buddhist doctrines  were first recorded on Ola leaves after passing through orally, here in the 1st century BC, during the reign Anuradapura capital. When you visit this temple dont forget to see the Buddhict museum with ""Tripitaka"" document and to write your name in a peace Ola leave (ancient document) as memory. First thing, find the ticket office when you get there as you can't buy one at the top. Luckily someone told us as it's not obvious where to get them. OK so you also need to have your legs covered so wear long trousers. When you get to the caves go to the far end and start there, that way you see the smallest first and save the best for last! Worth the climb but do take some water. The walk to the top is easier on the slope than the steps. Stopping off seats for those less fit. Worth the effort as the rocks and caves that host the temples are spectacular. The paintings inside and the history of their origin make this a great visit. Prepare to cover up of course and the heat can be meltingly awful but still worth it. Local guide spoke good English , was knowledgeable and although it was very busy found our group of 8 great viewing spots. This place is not far out of town; 3 kms, but I doubt people want to walk there. Here is what I did; tuk-tuk from Dad's for RS 150 to drop me off (8:30 AM), explore lower stupa then pay fee RS 250, drop off shoes, explore cave 1; nicest, cave 2; don't be a sinner or else and cave 3; not much there I could understand. Then I walked steps to upper smaller stupa that has a view of the hills & valley. Hey, how do I get up to the seated golden Buddha? With some directions AND my shoes on & a little help from an older lady I get to the path/road. It takes a hour to cane up to that Buddha (see photos), I stay +/- 20” and walking stick my way back down. I/you would have great views from up there folks. Even IF you do NOT go way up to the golden Buddha you should stop by Aluvihara IF you're going past, at least to see cave 1. FEW people were there. It's peaceful, man. There are HUGE boulders around this place. NICE! If your visiting Sri Lanka and going from central towards North you should stop at this temple which is situated in Matale District. An ancient temple constructed ages ago by King Walagamba still maintained in a well manner. the temple has many ancient Buddha status, A painting that represents the Himalaya mountain range, and the four great rivers, The arch of Dragon, A painting and status that depicts hell punishments. Worth a visit once. The education of the Buddhist monks writing / etching on leaves was more interesting than the caves themselves. A little bit run-down and obviously a heavy trail of tourists visit this location. Good views from the top of the temple. Rs. 250 entrance fee. Not good for wheelchairs or the elderly. For the cost of submission this attraction is underwhelming. The signing is not clear as to what attractions are on site, nor is the location and requirements to buy tickets. This is an ancient and a prominent  place of buddhist worship.   Many steps to climb, not for the faint hearted.   No footwear and suitable clothing covering knees and arms for both sexes. While travelling to Anuradapura I went to Aluvihara. The place was so Beautiful and Peaceful. It was a rock cave temple. Interesting site with kind of impressive caves but really overpriced. It's now 1500 rs !!! For a visit that last 20 minutes, no explanation at all touts everywhere selling Chinese made souvenirs. For that price, there is no toilet, and they make you pay for watching your shoes. Best thing to see is the sunset up the hill and you don't have to pay for that. A cave temple with ancient buildings. The place where Buddha dhamma which was being carried onto generations verbally was written into books. Crowdy on poya days and holidays. Less people on other days. This is located in the Matale town, around 30 km north of Kandy. This is where the Tripiṭaka (philosophical doctrines of Buddhism) was  transcribed.  This is belongs to  3rd Century B.C. This is a very nice cave temple with wonderful arts. Since this is a temple it is better to visit this place with suitable attire (not short and sleeveless). Really enjoyed these caves which are one of the most significant sites for Budhism. Lots of steps to get up to the caves. Much quieter than Dambulla Rock Caves so you have them to yourself, also cheaper only 1000 rupees. Our tour itinerary did not have a visit to Dambulla caves scheduled but our driver eased this visit in en route so we got a taster. A quick side trip with a compact, but still dramatic setting and colourful caves. The depiction of hell was interesting! Note you can drive right up to the entrance with a minibus. You can see the Temple & Buddha statue from the main road, where the entry point has an impressive elephant frieze. This site is very important in the Buddhists culture as the place where the first written records of Buddhism were made Visited at 07.30 on way to dambulla...just asked for donation...about 10 local visitors..lovely setting and in it's own way a better alternative to the kitsch of dambulla..monks accommodation looked far better and felt donation goes direct to monastary..if cool enough can hike 1km up hill to Buddha viewpoint. Combine with the Hindu temple in Matale. Beautiful art work in a serene setting. Awe inspiring. Quite a climb to get there but worth the effort and the monkeys kept us entertained along the way. We were not very impressed by this site especially the murals of the realms of hell. Have never seen anything like this in a Buddhist temple. Weird! Waste of time on our opinion. Our Homestay in Kandy recommended this Temple as a stopover enroute from Dambulla to Kandy. We are definitely glad she did. Entry was LKR250. It was quiet when we were there. Loved the atmosphere and setting of this temple. Much smaller and less touristy than the Dambulla one. This is a nice rock temple! But you have to climb almost 120 stairs before reaching the temple. But you are able to see the nice mountain views when you are up there. Beware of the monkeys as they will snatched your belongings away. No shoes are allowed inside the temple. You have to leave your shoes at the shoerack and you have to pay about 25rupees. Its worth going it to see the different statues inside the cave. Do note that if you have hire your own tour guide, it is not allowed inside the temple. Your tour guide has to speak discreetly to you on the history of the rock cave. Took some very good photos here as our group was lucky and had the place all to ourselves for quite a while. The children were,of course,immediately impressed with all the gory paintings in Technicolor depicting the king's punishments for not obeying the law of the land. Personally I prefered the golden Buddhas. This was already a monastery in I century a.D. and had a library that was destroyed in 1848 by the British troops during a revolt. It's not expensive, although you do bizarrely have to pay again half way around, but it's only just over £1 so for interest level it's worth it. No-one goes into the museum but it is very interesting, not many exhibits but a fascinating look into the art of inscribing on palm leaves, demonstrating how the original and replacement Buddhist doctrines were created, naturally there is a minor contribution for which the resident guide is grateful! This is a very significant place for Buddhists and appreciating why is the least a visitor can do to show respect. To fully understand how these caves came about and why, it's worth taking 5 minutes to read up about it. The ceilings are beautifully painted and whilst one cave may depict peace and serenity, in the next the cave paintings are a true revelation into just how nasty the afterlife could be if you sinned; extremely graphic and gory depictions of torture and execution. When you think you have seen it all there's a very strange cave with models along the same line, which depicts what the king would do to sinners. It's a little odd compared to the other caves which are more connected to Buddha. This particular cave is not really suitable for small children. A worthwhile little visit. This is a really good place to go and see some of the history of Buddhism if you are in the Dambulla /Aluvihare Region .Most people only come and stand outside and look at the statue on the hill ...but it is worth the time to go and look inside and it is Free so no need to pay to go in . Surrounded by giant boulders, this temple is a low-key and intriguing site. You'll climb past some caves with reclining Buddhas and when you continue to climb to the main rock, you'll find a huge golden Buddha on the hillside. Nice temple, but better to get to the temple either early morning or late evening cos the rock gets heated by the afternoon. Lot to climb, and to see. Just 3km from Mathale town. This was build in 3rd century  B.C. This place known as the first to write Buddhisum (documentation). Those are writen on leaves of plam trees. There are many monastery caves and has beautiful buddha's stratues. The caves walls are enriched with old arts. These caves looks a small version of Dambulla cave temple. There is a small museum next to caves so you can get understand how older days monks writen letters on tree leaves. This is one of most important place for Buddhists in world wide and It has many significant importance. The teaching of Buddha's has been booked by this place and It was founded by King Devanampiyatissa, around 300 B.C. We had a guided tour, and seen 4 of the 5 caves (one was being restored). You need to cover up boys knees (you can get a sarong there). Depending on the time you might have a small wait due to ceremony time (only 15 mins). It's amazing to think that this guy impacted so many people! Nice visit to look at the small old temple in the stones. Beside is one of the Buddhist Hell gardens with sculptures. Those who form opinions, deriding art and antiquity that has survived the ages, seem to find themselves looking at it constantly in Sri Lanka. It was here before you arrived on Earth. It will still be here after you depart Earth. I've glazed over a couple of the review headings that are posted below. In short, go to Knox Berry Farm, Blackpool or EuroDisney if 'entertainment' is what you are after (if that's what entertainment is). Alternatively, sit at home and interrogate your navel. 'Aluvihara' has an important history and is a learning centre for student Monks.  Traditional 'Ola Leaf' manuscript writing, is taught here. 'Aluvihara' is not a specific trip on its own. Traveling north-south between Kandy and Sigiriya, one would stop at three specific places on the way south... 1. Dambulla Rock Temples 2. Nalanda 3. Aluvihara ... or of course, in reverse order if traveling north. There are a number of organic Ayurvedic farms within close proximity to 'Aluvihara', if you have the time to visit. Otherwise, please give generously to this very active Monastery. Aluvihara is the place where the Buddhist scripture was committed to writing by monks who lived in the caves at this location. Although it is a very significant place with beautiful Buddha statues and paintings and an amazing view, it does not attract too many tourists and therefore the place can be enjoyed quietly. there are some steps to climb and getting to the top is highly recommended as the view is amazing. Another interesting area is the wall paintings depicting the punishments one gets in hell for committing different types of sins. The well maintained temple contains a library with the Buddhist scripture written on Ola leaves. The original ones were destroyed by the British and what the library houses are the ones written recently. Aluvihara is less of a tourist destination than Dambulla rock caves, although it's definitely worth a brief stop in to see the temples. They are a great way to learn some of the hindu/buddhist beliefs and although some of the motifs are quite graphic, it's an interesting place to wander. Small cave temple with nice statues worth a stop if you are passing on the road to/from Kandy. The paintings depicting karmic results are interesting but not the outside badly made models doing the same thing nearby the cave temple and stupa, it's not worth it to make a donation to see that separate ""exhibition"". Views from the stupa are good but it is a long and tortuous walk around many narrow lanes to the Golden Buddha statue far up the hill, you might get lost. The main building shows you Buddhist sutras which are still copied using traditional methods in ola script and some are available for purchase this is a nice place to visit, with the Rock Temple being the main attraction, very nice and cool on a hot day After a climb you'll see some of the most beautiful buddha stone statues of Sri Lanka. The number of detailed statues is just amazing. The view from the top will be a sight you'll never forget. Itz calm, peaceful and worth site to visit and have look..one of most well known temple among the buddhists but quite less visitors...just few km away from the mathale town...u have to climed few steps to reache the cave temple...several paintaings and murals can be seen in the caves which shows the life after death...locals two have to pay lkr 10/- &100/- to enter some caves...all types of visitors shoud well dressed prior to enter the temple premises.. This temple complex is set at the top of a rocky mound. To get to the first shrine you need to climb about 20 steep steps. Inside you'll find a lovely reclining Buddha plus smaller statues. There is another shrine next to it and equally well decorated, plus a couple of smaller shrines as you make your way up the rocks and steps. Note the white Stupa on the way down. If you glance up towards the trees you can see another golden Buddha, which can be reached from this site but it's a bit of a trek. Well worth the visit, and extremely interesting. A small complex and easy access, with religous paintings inside the caves, some of the which are vivid depictions of Hell! Have your name written on a piece of traditional fabric, in Sinhalese. As most tourist attractions it was 1500 rupees per person for tourists (free for locals), but after a bit of a hard climb we made it to the top. View was sensational, especially watching the sunset. Caves themselves were also really good to see and appreciate. It was annoying having to pay for ppl to look after the shoes even after we'd already paid so much but that was the only downside. Also, if you do go for sunset bring a torch as they didn't turn on the lights for the steep walk back Definitely worth seeing if you are in the area.  I wouldn't drive 2 hours to see it but anything short of an hour's drive I would recommend to get your driver to drive you there! Aluvihara in Mathale is a well worth a visit if you are passing by. The location is famous for its cultural value as the famous Thripitakaya was translated in this location. The temple in the rock cave is an amazing site to see. The Aluvihare Cave Temple has an important historical significance. It is believed that Aluvihare was the place where the Thripitaka (Buddhist scripture), which was passed down orally until then, was written down. The temple is built in the cave of a big rock, and there are beautiful painting and statues inside. A lot of locals come to worship here so might be crowded at times. You also need to get permission from the priests if you want to take pictures inside. It is also very easy to access since it is situated right on the main Kandy - Jaffna road (A9) , about 4km from Matale town. We were on our way to Sigirya when we decided to stop by this amazing place.  Famous for the fact that a few hundred years after the Buddha's death, his teachings were written down here by generations of monks (the whole lot was burned by the British centuries later), the temple is set among some huge boulders.  There are a couple of caves with some fantastic sculptures, masterpieces of Buddhist art.  In the museum, a nice man demonstrated how to write on palm leaves, which is how the monks did it back in the day. We stopped at the Aluvihara Rock Cave Temple on our way from Sigiriya via Dambulla to Kandy. It is smaller and much quieter than Dambulla, and no long climb to reach it. (We had done enough climbing after visiting the other sites earlier in the day.) There is a monastery within the site, which gives you the sense it is not only a museum but actually a holy place in use. It is well worth a stop. Nice temple with several different buddha statues. you need to climb some stairs to see it all. When we were there it was not crowded with tourists. Temple situated 32 km north of Kandy. It's a small cave cave temple but highly significant to the history of Buddhism. During the 1st century BCE, the island was ravaged by anarchy and starvation, and the very survival of Buddhism was threatened. This was because at the time, its teachings were orally transmitted by monks, and many had died or left the island. Some of the surviving monks then decided to commit the whole of the Thripitaka to writing. The forth Buddhist council was convened and as  a result, it was written down for the first time in the island's history. In this way, the teachings were preserved in it's original form and Buddhism survived this difficult period. The momentous event was held at the Aluvihara cave temple, originally known as the Aloka Lena , or ""Cave of Light"". On the road from Kandy to Dambulla. It is worth a stop! Quiet place with a nice view. The cave temples are well maintained. This takes about an hour in total & is well worth it. The entrance is stunning. You then walk up steps to get to the temple. The walk up the steps takes a bit of time, but is not too steep. When you get to the top you need to take your shoes off before entering. There are 5 temples and they are all stunning. Cost is about $15AUD per person. Very well worth a visit here, it's much much quieter than any of the other Temples we visited and apart from my wife and I, our guide  and driver we only encountered one other couple here. There's a lot to see on different levels, and some of the paintings are very different from anything we've seen anywhere else. The visions of hell are just that! Lovely carvings around doorways and many Buddhas to admire. The small museum is worth a visit too and the curator gave us a demonstration of the writing techniques used in the old palm leaf manuscripts. Highly recommend a visit here, but ensure you dress appropriately for a religious site. Aluvihare Rock Temple or Matale Aluvihare is one of the most important Buddhist temples near Matale city centre. This is the place where the Pali Canon was first written. There are some caves and recently added viharaya, pagoda and museums. Museums have a little collection of ancient artefacts. It seems the temple is overlooked even amidst its importance. I feel its old pride has been taken away by modern buildings. It has high cultural, historical and educational values. Please wear full clothes. Shorts and skinnies are not allowed. The Great King Walagamba had built this during the 03rd century BC. This cave temple is carved into an isolated rock outcrop 500ft high and a mile around the base.  The temple dates back to. Efirst century BC.  The caves of Dambulla sheltered the King Walagamba during his 4 years of exile from Anuadhapua.  There are a toal or five  temples .. In the first is a statue of Buddha in a reclining position 47 ft long. In the second cave, the finest and largest of them all, there are 150 life-size statues of Gods from the Buddhist religion along with numerous images of the Buddha himself.  The ceiling is also covered with frescoes which depict great events from the life of Lord Buddha.  Standing on the cave top one gets a panoramic view of the entire valley and on clear days the Sigiriya Fort is also visible.  The uphill climb is pretty daunting for senior citizens as I experienced and had to pause several times to catch my breadth but it was worthwhile having reached the summit.  Just breathtaking ! We visited mid morning, when it was already warm and the caves just made matters slightly worse. We stayed in the lower bit and did not go up the hill to the Buddha, with hindsight the correct decision due to the heat, but I feel we have missed something. Make sure you visit the museum, the caretaker may do a example of a scroll that all the writings have been made on - we have a souvenir from our trip for a small tip. Worth a visit. This was a smaller temple than Dambulla but we preferred it.  Small entrance fee of 250 Rs.  Reclining buddahs and roof paintings, but they seemed more vibrant as they were lighter, closer and easier to see.  There were people praying but it didn't feel intrusive just quite serene and tranquil.  The scenes of punishment with the devils were interesting, reminiscent of Dantes inferno.  Various rooms, and a good view of a large buddah and temple which have been built on a hill overlooking the valley.  There is a library, you can visit.  Also a naieve section with papier mache statues metering out punishment for various wrongdoings.  Overall, easily an hours visit.  We preferred this to Dambulla as not as touristy. ideal place for meditation. best to visit early morning. and evening. great historical and valuable place. The ancient history of the place it self signifies the importance of the place where the Thripitaka was put in to text. The place was on a rock and best time to visit there is early morning when the atmosphere is cool. But even during the day time the caves are cool and refreshing. There is a place where the Underworld is displayed, which frankly was useless. A must visit if you are around the Matale district. Much better rock and cave temples around the country for a much more reasonable price (if not for free/donation). As it's a tourist attraction dragging in lots of coach parties the walk up has also attracted the opportunistic tat-sellers. Stayed at Dad's holiday home and walked here in about 30 minutes. It costs 250 Rupees entrance. Its really interesting. The highlight for me by far was walking up to the Golden Budha on the hill. Its a steep climb in parts and you need to be relatively fit. The initial stages are not very well signposted. I found myself in someone's garden at one point. They were clearly used to it and very lovely.  They showed me the way and helped me climb through their fence!!! I think you can get most of the way up in a Tuk Tuk if you want to avoid some of the climb....but the effort of walking makes the reward greater :) The view at the top is great and you can climb right up to the Budha. When I was there I was the only person  other than the prayer master guy. He invited me in, said a prayer, made a mark on my forehead and made me ring a big gold bell once - Im not entirely sure what it all meant - but it was rather lovely :) It was fun to walk on all those rocks and sweat like never before but it doesn't help to have so many vendors around. One might want to sit on the way up to catch breath and drink water but these vendors won't leave you alone. For some reason, Sri Lankans don't understand the meaning of word NO. Paid some lkr1500+ and no helping hand. No details anywhere or brochures and the guide costs you around $20. You can haggle but it takes way too much energy on an already exhilarating hike up. Just go and see around, nothing magnificent inside to pay the fee. But if you have a guide then you might enjoy it more - can't say. An Amazing temple, built under a large rock with cave shrines.. Well worth a visit, my favourite temple.. The Monkeys on the walk up the steps can be a nuisance if you have bought the lotus flower offerings.. Many people confuse this with cave temple. But these 2 are different. as far as i remember from my study 'Aluvihara; means temple of ash. alu means ash. according to mythology there was a giant living at this place once upon a time. he used 3 rocks as his cooking pot. so there was ash.Later monks used them as shelter. Still there are rocks. u have to climb up. u can imagine those was giant's cooking pot! we were there at ""poya' means full moon. many people came for prayer wearing white dresses. we joined them, they dont mind. there is some peculiar cartoonish pics on wall describing punishments of sinners afterlife. i was wondering as far as i know Buddhism is not about crime and punishment. there is no hell or haven in Buddhism. i was confused and there was not to explain. from the the top u can enjoy the scenic beauty and a statue of Buddha from another hill which is very far. we really appreciated local cone ice cream at the foot of the rock after get down. If you're planning on visiting the Aluvihara Rock, it's worth climbing up the rock, a nice view of the Knuckles mountain range and nice breeze. Located in Matale, this temple is an ancient Buddhist heritage site. It is a historic place of worship where the Thripitaka (The essential Buddhist script) has been written by a congregate of elite Buddhist monks. The rock cave is full of ancient statues and arts while an exhibition by the side illustrates the types of punishments that the Kings used to put convicted persons under back in the day. This cave temple has two significant reasons for a traveler to visit. Firstly is an ancient temple dating back to pre-colonization of Sri Lanka and its architecture and the location and rock caves are unique in its own. Secondly this place was where Buddhist doctrine ( Thripitaka) which heather to conveyed from verbal form and generation of monks to the next, have been documented after a gathering of thousands of learned monks and consensus. it was documented in manuscripts of palm leaves. Well it's pretty amazing to have a load of paintings and Buddhas at the top of a hill. In some cave-like caves.  So I did try to feel enthusiastic about it. I enjoyed the climb up since there is such a lot of good food in Sri Lanka I needed to walk. It would be shame not to see and it's not crowded. By good tradition you have to start paying at the entrance after climbing a dangerous stair, 250rp per person. If you think you can expect a similar experience as Dambulla cave  you are wrong. This are just a few small caves with mural decorations and a laying buddha. At the end to the left there is something awkward, a torture museum where a guy at the entrance tries to make you pay a second time. It is ridiculous. It is not worth your time. Visiting Dambulla, I had the opportunity to visit this ancient Temple. This has a very long histry, as the Buddhist Tripitakaya has been inscribed. Very Calming and relaxing I love this template. It is a hidden gem in Sri Lanka. Not sure why more tourists don't visit. This temple has cultural significance as it is the place Tripitakaya was transcribed on palm leaves (housed in the library on site). This site is well worth visiting with lots of sculptures and paintings in the caves. A warning if walking is an issue. There are a lot of steps up to the caves and this could be hard work. Take it slowly and it is worth the effort. The caves are at the top of a hill, lots of steps and not accessible yo wheelchair users and also wouldn't recommend to people with restricted mobility. Once you get to the top, you have to remove your shoes and then walk some more rock / cement before entering the caves. For some people, this can be very painful (maybe some feet, like mine,  aren't great for going barefoot!?!). Anyway, it's all worth it because of he beautiful statues and wall paintings. Tip: shove a pair (or extra pair) of fat, cotton socks, in your rucksack or bag. Once you remove your shoes you *can* wear socks, and this makes it much more bearable! Loved the cave temple s . Very clean and such amazing views .the climb is also not a lot .Very friendly people . Very good surroundings and well planned development is visible.Many pleasant local Buddhist Monks are an asset to the temple. The young monks are very courteous and helpful. The price of 1500 rupees per head was completely not justified. Once you have climbed the 360 steps they want another 25 rupees to look after your flip flops while you go inside the temple. The temple is poorly maintained and in my opinion very average with lots of standing/sitting/laying buddas in need of some TLC. The rock itself ,the paintings and the carving of the rock is quite impressive but by no means unique. Ticket 250 rupees + want extra donation in two caves. How result, we don't visit in one of caves. Artworks inside caves is interesting, but low quality, in bad state and not ancient. Glad we had a brief stop here on the way to Dambulla. 250 rupees entrance fee. No crowds. Nice views and caves and gory paintings worth a look. The dignity of Matale where a long time ago THRIPITAKAYA was written on. Still being worshipped by all Buddhists as well as others. A place must see and visit. The old photos (still preserved) are wanders of our ancestors. The paintings in the caves are really graphic and I actually really liked them. Would not suggest bringing kids Built by King Devanampiyatissa, the first Buddhist King of ancient Sri Lanka, the site is steeped in history as the place where the Tripitaka was transcribe in Pali on Ola leaf.  The cave paintings are unusually gruesome depictions of the consequences of sin, and the display of the 32 types of tortures used by ancient kings in the nearby rock museum may be disturbing to some youngsters.  The statue on the hill beyond the temple is accessible by another path.  There is a person providing examples of writing on ola leaf in the museum which is an interesting souvenir to have. It is a very short walk up one flight of stairs to the cave temple complex, takes about 5 minutes from the parking lot to reach the monastery caves. Ticket price per adult is Rs 250 and there are 2 reclining Buddhas in their own caves. The torture scenes are quite interesting here too! Worth a quick stop on the drive from Kandy towards Dambulla if you have the time to spare Bit of a walk up to the cave, but well worth it, very interesting and peaceful place to wander around. The cave's are cool and full of a variety of Buddha's. Very different from the normal temple Ancient Temple and monastery to visit for who is interested in the Buddhist religion and its history in Shri-Lanka. The museum explains the re-writing of books destroyed during the Dutch presence. It is a must place to visit as a buddhist, & worship. 2 km away from Matale town and easy access to the temple. Aluvihare temple is located few kilometers off Matale town , along Matale -Dambulla road. Waking through the Arc entrance, and climbing 47 stone carved steps, you can proceed up to the caves. One of the caves is historic as it is the cave Priest Buddhagosha wrote the doctrine of Buddha in pali with dedication. Another cave is the temple with caved statues of lord Buddha where large number of devotees call over to worship. climbing higher you reach the chaithya where you could have a panoramic view of the surrounding of blue hills around you. . At the temple museum you get the opportunity of experiencing the records of ""ola leaf"" where Ola leafs are seasoned and written on it with coal and oils extracted from ""Kekuna"" seeds. If you commence your journey from Kandy it takes only about one to one and half hours (25kms) to reach the location. Once visiting the Aluvihare temple there are many more attractions to view in Matale This is a temple about 30 kilo-metre North of Kandy, just beyond Matale on the Dambulla road . It's built on a hill, and not as well-known as the ones at Dambulla. Because of this, there are hardly any visitors, and you can wander around peacefully. The importance of this place is that it was where the teachings of the Budhha were first written down, after five hundred years of word of mouth teaching.  It is in a lovely setting. You can combine the visit of Aluvihara Rock temple with the Hindu temple in Matale. It is similar in style to Dambulla, although not as spectacular, this temple was worth visiting. The entry fee is not much and it is Rs 200 per head. There is no charges on parking. It is well worth a visit while passing for an interesting small hour. It is a bit of a walk up to the cave, but it is well worth it. It is a very interesting and peaceful place to wander around but very different from the normal temples. Monks accommodation looked far better and felt donations directed to the monastery is good. Very few tourists found there and this made the experience quite different from Dambulla with its crowds. On the way to Dambulla we stopped at Matale and were pleasantly surprised at seeing things there. It is a nice complex of cave temples after a small climb up some with stairs. There were Dambulla like caves only but much smaller and much quieter. No-one trying to sell you stuff in the premises. Some caves, shows devilish torture depictures and therefore not suitable for kids which is only in one. The view from the top is nice.  The location is very clean and gives such an amazing views. There were graphic images and statues.   If atmosphere is cool enough, can hike 1km up the hill to a location of the Buddha viewpoint. The climb is also not a lot. People around are friendly. Well worth a visit. Up to a few years ago there were no charges to speak of but the government cottoned on to the huge money making potential of a 'captive audience' and bulldozed the prices up. Sri Lankans either go free or for Rs 60 (0.30 UKP For the money you don't even get a guide, printed material, or facilities. Some people we saw came up the mountain without tickets - perhaps chancing their arm - but were told that money could not be accepted and they would have to return to base and then come back. This is a succession of temples built into the rock. You need to start from the furthest and also the smallest and work forwards. it is difficult to be contemplative with tons of people milling around so early morning would be best. We left the site 'Buddhad Out'. There is a limit to the number of times you can be impressed by a single form(at). School parties are not helpful. They make a lot of noise - well they are kids. PS You will get pestered by sales people on the way up and also down. SEE MY OTHER REVIEWS FOR AN OVERVIEW OF SRI LANKA. Click on my user name to the left of this page and see the relevant entries. This temple is 42km south if Dambulla on the road to Matale. There's a golden Buddha high above it on the hillside. Although newer than the one at Dambulla it has great significance to the people of SL and it's good to visit both and compare them as they are quite different in atmosphere. Visitor numbers here are much lower than at Dambulla so it's usually a peaceful spot to wander round and explore the caves with their Buddha images and wall painting which are entertaining if somewhat gruesome. I think it's a great spot to visit and if you are feeling really energetic you can ascend a kilometre further up the hill to the golden Buddha We visited this temple as a day trip from Kandy, we didn't want to travel all the way to Dambulla so this was a perfect alternative. It may be smaller but it's really beautiful and generally less crowded, we actually could see the main cave on our own. We paid 300 rupees for the caves, then a man wanted more ""dollars"" to enter the cave with the ""sins of sri lanka"" but we didn't want to pay more so we didn't visit that one. I honestly don't know if it was actually included in the entrance fee and he was just scamming us. Complete you visit going up the hill to the gold buddha Aluvihara temple located much close to Matale town.it is one of the main Buddhist temples in Sri Lanka  and founded in 3rd century BC.this temple has done  very much contribution for Buddhism and it's protection. Due to bad climatic condition Buddhist monks had problems of memorising the Buddha's teachings so they(this temple) decided to write the Buddha's teachings in 1st century BC for future generations. What you  ane see now: Cave monastery with beautiful paintings. This is not a much touristic place and entrance ticket also very low. This temple has several parts - lots of rock paintings and Buddha images to see. Don't forget to look up at the honeycombs hanging from the rock curve high overhead. This place is easy to find, it’s entrance lies on the main road to Dambulla. There are few caves with both lying and sitting golden Buddha. It’s very peaceful and beautiful with a nice view from the top. A very nice cave temple complex where there are several caves with Bhoeda statues in addition there is a small museum. Definitely worth making a stop here I visited this Temple area on my way from Habarana to Kandy. The entrance fee of 250SLR is very modest for this site as it doesn't really attract tourists. I went there because of the write-up in a travel guide and because a previous reviewer stated ""most of the paintings in the temple represent various scenes with demons, including some extremely cruel torture scenes, which I've never seen in other, usually calm and tranquil Buddhist temples."". The paintings are scenes of grotesque torture that will be your fate if you don't follow the teachings of Buddha! Really bizarre and worth seeing if you're in to crazy art. Great views, interesting caves, although not as good as Dambulla, didn't like being spivved for extra cash for a gimmicky side show of torture models or a ""papyrus"" book mark in the museum - steer clear of these unwanted additions to your visit. Went here and was pleased to not get changed an extortionate price to get in (just rs200) and to be left alone to wander for a bit while there. They're was even a wedding taking place at the time too. Don't miss it. Hi I would like to say this is teample awesome place to visit ....an one more thing to happy this my home town also ...even I am proud to be home town ...any one want to visit pls let me know I will be there an will explain all about history ....if u interesting ...✌️❤️🙏🕉️🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰. Much love yaaaa a ...stay with Rasta Neel .... Not all temples are the same and this one holds a few dark surprises in its wall etchings!  Definitely worth a visit. You can see the ancient views in this temple , it's really worth to visit to see how naturally located all those rocks and to see the historical things. Unlike the Dambulla Rajamaha Viharaya, this temple is much smaller and much easier to reach. Entrance is 250lkr. Shoes storage is free :) The sign as usual says 'no photographs', but the person at the ticket booth said it was OK. Many pictures at this temple are around 'Hell' topic. A local worker joined us inside explaining about the temple (asked for a donation at the end) From the top there is a good view on the area and on the Golden Buddha located at some distance. The temple seems to be a working monastery with monks going around. We didn't see any other tourists during our visit. It's very expensive for a steep walk up the side of a hill to see a cave  if you haven't seen a cave or the top of a hill this is for you Only so many temples in so many day until the fun runs out! This is the main tourist attraction of Matale. This cave temple is an important place for Sri Lankan buddhist as writing of Thripitaka in Pali happened here at 1st century BC. It is situated 1km away from Matale town at A9 road. You can visit few caves at this temple. I think foreigners have to buy a ticket to enter some caves. ( What I don't agree to pay money to enter religious places ) Seru Gala is situated 1km behind Aluwihare Temple. Although it is not historicaly important but provide nice surrounding view. You can walk there from Aluwihare Temple. There is a newly built massive Buddha statue at Serugala. Located in the Matale district, in the town of Aluvihare. The cave temple is renowned for where the thripitakaya was written during the reign of king Walagamba. Buddhism was preserved in Sri Lanka as a result of the thripitakaya, being preserved in safety at this location. A peaceful and tranquil place that has great cultural significance. This may be one of the most interesting Buddhist temples I've ever visited. It's situated on top of a rock and consists of several buildings and caves with a stupa on the very top of the rock with some steep steps leading to it. Most of the paintings in the temple represent various scenes with demons, including some extremely cruel torture scenes, which I've never seen in other, usually calm and tranquil Buddhist temples. The views from the stairs, and especially from the stupa are magnificent. And the brick gate with a bell in the middle of the temple gave me some additional colonial flavor of the place, though I have no idea if it is really a colonial influence, or a purely local construction. They require an entrance fee for the visit and some extra donation to visit one of the caves, but the place is absolutely worth it. I was surprised to see many other reviewers mentioning crowds, since when I was there the place was almost empty - probably 3-5 other visitors (mostly locals). very interesting place to visit  - calm and peaceful  a working holy place not just a tourist place to visit - good photo opportunity - Many stairs but worth the effort. Temple carved from the rock up to 5 different caves / temples. A little dark in the temples but understandable. Trip Advisor please remove Buddha photo from your posting. this was one of our fisrt trips out in Sri Lanka and it was amazing. A bit of a walk from the enterance and quiet a steep hill. But when you get to the top its amazing. very  important place for Buddhist and a for tourists. It will taking a part of a The sacred temple is an archaeological site. This was one of 3 temples we visited on the road from Kandy to Dambulla. There was a service taking place in the gardens but we walked through and up to the rock caves were you see what is apparently a Buddhist version of hell. It certainly not somewhere I would want to end up. Its an interesting place with views up to another Buddha statue in the hills. Its well worth a visit. These caves are interesting for a short visit. There is not much to be done around there but the painting and statues in the caves are impressive. Aluvihara Rock Cave Temple is not to be missed while in Sri Lanka.  It is amazing to see all the work that was done so long ago.  The details and the colors are fantastic. The temple has a unique historic value since this was the place where the holy Thripitakaya was written during era of king Walagamba It is at a monastery and a school, at the bottom of a hill.  If you have been to the cave temple in Dambulla, there is no point visiting  this one unless you are free in the area. It was very interesting to see the wall paintings of the Buddhist hell, for the sexual sinners. Something I would have never thought I would see. Fascinating. A brilliant trip and place to visit. The statues around are very atmospheric and there is lovely art work adorning the walls. Definately a place to see. There are five ancient caves having statues of Buddha in various positions.though the caves are pretty but one has to climb a lot (around 250 stairs) to reach them.i didn't have a very good experience coz it was very tiring and not worth the effort both physically and monetarily for me You can see this old temple after climbing up few stairs. Just before the entrance there is a place to leave your shoes (you have to go inside barefoot). If someone doesn't feel very comfortable with this, it is advisable to carry an extra pair of socks. The temple is located in the rocks. Inside the temple someone can see magnificent statues and frescos. No photos with people in front of Buddha statues are allowed, it is considered as lack of respect. Very close to the entrance you can see the holy tree. After seeing the temple you can enjoy the very nice view. It is a place worth visiting and it is recommended to have a guide with you. Ancient  cave  temple( Aluviharaya cave temple) in Sri Lanka. This   rock-cave temple is a sacred Buddhist temple located in Aluvihara, on the road from Dambulla to Matale. Surrounded by hills. lovely place to visit and lot more to see. When we arrived at the Golden Temple, we were a little put off by the kind of tacky looking museum entrance and cheesy monk statues. Our tuk tuk driver said it was the same as the Temple of the Tooth in Kandy and so we almost didn't take the time to go up to the temple proper. I am SO glad we didn't listen to our driver who, upon reflection, was just trying to get us to visit his ""factory"" instead in the hopes of getting a commission. Not only is the Rock Temple in Dambulla NOTHING like the Temple of the Tooth, but it was easily one of my favourite places that we visited in Sri Lanka. The temple itself is so fascinating, the way it's carved into the rock and how every inch of the cave is covered in beautiful paintings. I found it incredibly moving to be there, to the point where it brought me to tears. We took some time to meditate and were fortunate enough to witness a beautiful sunset from up on the hill. If you have a spiritual side, or an appreciation for world religions, this is a site not to be missed!",4.3,285,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/14/8e/69/d9/aluvihara-rock-cave-temple.jpg?w=700&h=400&s=1,0.5524861878453038,38.12154696132597,7.734806629834254,1.6574585635359116,17.12707182320442,34.806629834254146
Ambewela Farms,"Ambewela Farms. I dont know about farming but it didnt seem like that they do things properly. Farm was massive though. Lovely walk. Had a fresh glass of milk. Still dont know what to say! The pictures of the animals on this farm were on green rolling hills. We went there and the cows were in sheds, stomping on their own excrement. The smell was awful. The rabbits were in cages and we couldn’t face looking at the goats. We made a hasty exit as my friend and I were upset looking at the state of the place. Please don’t give these people your money. This was a terrible experience. This is a place where you must visit if you are travelling with kids so they can learn a lot. You can see the wind mills beside this farm and they are used to generate electricity. A beautiful & well maintained farm, only problem is the road leading to the farm is muddy on rainy days. The area around the farm is so beautiful, some places resemble Europe. The Farm shop has stuff, the prices are the same as in any shop that has their products, so not worth buying stuff from there as You carry unnecessary load in the vehicle. Nice views all round. Visitors just buy the tickets for observing things. No arrangements to obtain further information other than by looking good place to know about goats and cows. its very useful for project works and educational tour. many people coming and going to there.you can see very old cows and biggest cow there. its from Netherlands.and you can eat fresh foods and drinks there. This farm is situated surrounding beautiful landscapes. We saw cows, goats and rabbits in the farm. and it was a different experience. the climate was cool in the morning but at noon it was really hot. There is a cafe and restaurant where the visitors can buy diary products which are freshly produced in the farms. This a very good farm, only cattle, imported from New Zealand. Very clean place, but visitors are not allowed in to the farm. The place sell, hot  Pure Cow's Milk, around A$7.00 a glass. The best I have ever tasted. This place is 5km off road from Horton Plains route. They charge 200 Srilankan rupees for foreigners and show stinking cow shade and goat shade and rabbit farm. The place was just stinking even from 200 meters distance. We went half the way and returened back . The milk products for sale are really good. The curd which is a yoghurt is outstanding. Lots of really good cows and well maintained. Great place We arrived here at around 3:30pm and left around 5:30pm. Our boys 11&9 year old enjoyed the chance to pet the cows and see how they are milked. We had fresh cow milk and fish rolls at the end of the day. One of the coolest and scenic places in Sri  Lanka to catch your breath. I never find it boring to visit there over and over again. Situated in the nuwara eliya district it's only 17km from the district capital nuwara eliya.its on the way to world's end on a well carpeted narrow road.even if you don't want to visit the factory,just go for a long drive.we went in the evening and it was so  peaceful and just beautiful.there is a small  lake too. Ambewela Farm is a scenic dairy farm known for its cool climate, fresh milk products, and beautiful green surroundings. It’s a peaceful place to relax, enjoy nature, and learn about dairy farming. Plenty of cows, grasslands and place to be amidst nature. The cows are majestic and children could pet them too The journey to Ambewala farm from N'eliya is approx. 17kms which would take about 30mints due to the roads not carpeted and lots of bends. You get to pass a beautiful lake and a dam which you will not feel like taking your eyes off from the view! If you go to nuwaraeliya, you should visit the ambewala farm to check out some giant animals! :-) The place is amazing and you feel like heaven when you walk through the area. The cow milking is the highlight place and other places are very nice. You can have goat milk as well. The farm was closed (on 18.5.24) and there was no information given to the usual hotels in the area.  We were staying at a well known local hotel and they had no idea that the farm was closed.  It was a wasted morning! It's going to be closed for another week. So it might be a good idea to call before you decide to drive all the way there. Nice to see how different the area is from Nuwara Eliya. Is a beatyful landscape and a Nice farm. Low price entree: 200 rupee per person. Seeing cows grazing freely with their calves on the cartons and advertisements, I was expecting to see the same at the farm. However, the fields looked quite empty with cows stashed in a barn with the young calves stashed separately in another, it was depressing to see the calves separated from their mothers. Even in the goat shed, adult goats were on one side jumping up and down in a limited space whilst the kids were stacked in tiny crate-like cages, three stashed in one crate which was about 3 ft in length and width. I was wondering if they were ever taken out to walk in the fields. Truly I was not expecting to see such a thing considering the fact that I believed that Sri Lankans are gentle and kind on animals. The view from the farm is truly beautiful, but the treatment of the animals gave all that away. visited Ambewela farm approximatly 17km from Nuwaraeliya town. Nice place to see Cows,goats & Rabbits raised for economic purposes.You could see the milking of cows on specific times.The cafetaria serves fresh milk , Yoghurt , snacks etc. Rs.100 for entrance not worth it, Rs.20 for children..You could see Rabbits raised for meat and Goat as well. Made the 17km journey all the way from Nuwara Eliya town, only to be informed that the farm is closed for visitors due the Corona Virus. What irks me is not the fact that they have been compelled to take precautions, but that they wait till visitors come all that way to the entrance only to be asked to turn back and go. Maybe if they published a circular or public notice, it would help with visitors not wasting their precious time and fuel making the drive. Poor Management decisions or inconsiderate management for sure. If you're going to go around Nuwara Eliya,don't miss this place. Needs a private vehicle to reach there. Spectacular views on the way to there. You have to buy a ticket to enter the premises. Not much expensive. Try some foods and drinks made with the milk of the farm's animals. You can see the cow milk collecting process in here. So cold here. Bring a sweater if you're unable to bear the coool. It a nice place. to see  cows, pregnant cows, calves and stinky rabbits.  Situated approx 17km from Nuwara Eliya town.  You must taste a vanilla milkshake. In today city life, there is very little room for the kids to see Animals unless they occasionally visit a Zoo. That too have only a sample like, just an Animal or two. But here you get to see a lot of animals and quote interesting too. The Milking happens in the morning and evening, if you are planning to visit, do make sure you are there at the farm during the milking times. And there are a couple of abnormally huge bulls, which are a must see too. It's very we'll  maintain farm all the way it's nice green grace. There are some farm animals like cow, etc But mostly impres me is the nice green grace around the farm A beautiful cattle farm, to be more specific a milk farm. Situated in the hilly region of Nuwaraeliya, spread almost across 1000 acres, Ambewela farms is a must visit for people of all ages. Almost 2lac Cows from Netherlands are bred in a natural environment. The grasslands are lush green and picturesque. One can also have a look at the milking of the cows if lucky to reach at the particular time. We reached at 12:30pm and were fortunate to have a peep at it. There are different sheds where one can even have a look at the humongous Bulls, just born calves, grown up calves, expecting mother cows. Also the farm breeds Netherland goats and super huge rabbits. The baby calves are too cute. The amazing part about the entire farm is, the way everything is very well maintained and kept clean at all times. Also they have the cheese manufacturing unit and a cafeteria where one can have all kind of milk products. Their drinking yoghurt is worth trying. Photography is not allowed once you enter the main farm, but you can photograph the huge number of lazing around cows in the lush Greenlands while on your way. If you are traveling towards Nuwaraeliya then this is a must visit. Entrance ticket is not expensive at all for foreigners as well. Hardly 200 SL rupees p.p. The cheese taste is just terrible. It doesn't even value it's price. Credit card payments are not allowed in the cafeteria as well. I was so lucky that I didn't bring your cheese for my friends. Other than it, the place is good to visit. You can see some animals such as rabbits, cows, goats and etc. Kids can see feeding, milking, making cheese and etc. You would need to bear with the animal smell. You can buy diary products from here. I din't like the farm much, but the way when you go towards farm is beautiful. The blue sky and green grass please your eyes. I love of that hill top of diary farm area with very very chilling climets.there are very beautiful views makes always with misty wind. First the road towards the farm from Nuwara Eliya was amazing with grass rich fields on both side of the road provided a very pictorial view. The Farm itself is huge, it has a cattle shed which shows live cow milking, it has a goat shed also with little calves were so cute. A rabbit shed also which are generally used for Meat. Overall nice learning experience for Kids. Must go with the family This is mainly a cattle farm with cattle origination from New Zeland . The cows here are massive. We were able to see the milking and feeding process. There is a nice café with tea coffee and fresh milk. It's worth trying the fresh milk. Very basic and nothing much to see. The facilities are not very clean either. If you want to see greenery all around you, with buffaloes and cows grazing in your sight and just relax watching the mother natures, this place is a must visit The cows that were kept in the various sheds seem to be in very sad conditions. The pregnant ones for example were all chained with almost no room for movement. Calves were sleeping on metal racks. Live rabbits (sold for meat) are kept in small individual cages where the floors of the cages are uncovered wire mesh. They are in really uncomfortable conditions. A good way to spend some of the day.. The surrounding area is gorgeous. Keep in mind that it is a farm so you will smell some nice odors. 100 rupees to enter It is nice place to see.you can see big farm garden. Nice area.big green ground around the way. Animals.cow ,Rabbit , goat etc You can buy fresh milk , yourget , cheese from there Went to farm ambiance like New Zealand can see some animals good location experience I am not recommend this place for tourist. It depends how interested you are in milk and dairy products. If you are then you'll love seeing all the cows, calves and bulls. Mind the smell and flies though as it stinks! There was only a little cheese making video to see how cheese is made, it would've been nice to see some kind of demonstration. The best part of our trip was trying some of the yoghurt made with the milk from the farm, it tasted great!! I think this is the biggest milk farm in Sri Lanka. The location and the surrounding is fascinating. You can see and even touch cows and calves. And also you can watch how they do the milking process and cheese manufacturing. They have a farm outlet. From there you can buy Ambewela yogurt, milk for cheaper price. Absolutely good and definitely worth a visit. Ambewela is a small town located in the Nuwara Eliya District of Sri Lanka. We called that area ""Little New Zealand"". The town is situated approximately 17 km from Nuwara Eliya. When you go there atmosphere is cool and the surronding is really nice. You can enjoy the area. You can see cattles eating grass when you go there. Enjoy a glass of milk. But the smell is bit bad. So if you don't like that smell go near to the farms. Stay in your vehicle or go straight to the canteen area. A little disappointed with this dairy farm which is popular with the locals. Not a lot to see and there is an entrance fee which is becoming a little annoying in Sri Lanka. Smelly barns where they keep the cows, Bulls and calfs. Basic cafe where they sell their produce. On a positive note, the surrounding countryside is beautiful and reminds one of New Zealand or Australia This is located quite far from main city,,but we love driving in hills so it was a nice drive...on reaching there,,before the entrance only,,lush green farms spread far away was a visual treat...kids cheered as they saw lots of cows grazing,,in large numbers... Inside you can see the cows milking,,by machines,,then they also have rabbits and calves and big bulls... you can also enjoy glass of hot fresh milk,,or yummy yoghurt,,,they have other snacks too .. its anice place to visit.. There is hardly much to do or see here. Mostly visited by locals. Best avoided and so something else. saw this on the ride to Hortons plains. beautiful tea estates, lot of mist and a very cool feel and ambience You have to travel about 17kms from the main road to the farm known as New Zealand farm of Abewela. Very nice view on the way. But very little to see when you go there. If you are interested in seeing milking of cows reach the place between 1200hrs and 1400hrs. Staff is not supportive of the visitors though they charge money for entrance. We arrived here at around11:am and left around 3:30pm. Our kids enjoyed the chancidse to pet the cows and see how they are milked. We had fresh cow milk and fish rolls at the end of the day. Kids loved seeing the animals,  but adults agreed that it would be more enjoyable and educational with a guide to explain the dairy farm processes.  Guests are welcome to walk around the farm unaccompanied,  exploring the cheese factory,  milking parlour,  sheds,  etc.  Good experience all in all.  Be prepared for lots of walking - no tractor ride available. Foreigners are charged higher rate than locals.  Guests can also purchase Ambewala products from the store on site All the animals are very cute especially the rabbits. The staff was friendly and the animals were looked after well. A great experience. The climatic and economical conditions in Ambewela make it an ideal location for dairy farming. Ambewela Farms are made up of two farms, Ambewela Farm and New Zealand Farm. Blessed with the cool climes and pristine environment of the hill country, Ambewela Farm boasts superior breeds of cattle, modern technology and top-quality pastures where cattle graze freely. The result is an organisation of international standards in a local setting, producing the best quality milk and milk products A must visit place for educational purpose, specially when you are accompanying kids. The route to this farm is beautiful with rolling hills and undulating topography. One can sea animals in cow shed and understand the whole process of dairy farming. Sorry for the incorrect price of a fresh glass of hot milk. It was only Rs. 50 or $0.50 cents and not $7.00. It is worth a try. the best milk I have ever tasted. Nice place. Good fresh milk. i was visit with my family. and also nice location. kids are like very much. But Cheese factory was close. I visited the farm in January 2016 for the second time. The Farm was clean and nicely maintained. Worth visiting. Had a great experience in a nice environment. This farm is a great place for education purpose. really different experience. But their service is not value for Rs:100. because of no any guide. It was a very nice visit for my 2 kids (after many years in Europe) and very instructive one.. The sights are simply great.. and very relaxing; one feels himself not only traveling on Earth but also in Paradise; It was very nice to show my kids the Goats and their various ages, the Cows and the milk extractions, also the very little cows sitting near their mothers; we also saw the rabbits as well as the Bulls.. This is one of the best places to visit if you are closer to NuwaraEliya. About 14 to 15 Km's from NuwaraEliya town and you can visit this place while you travel to Horton Plains as it's on the way. A good farm to visit by locals. It's only the farm lots of cows and goats. Nice chill weather. On the way from Nuwara eliya you can see some wind power plants too. We passed this Ambewela Farms on our way to Horten’s Plain from our hotel in Katukitula.  The travellers on the road that goes through the Farm onward to Horten’s Plain can feast their eyes on cattle grazing in the meadows. The whole farm area is very picturesque. Hills on both the sides are so green and lush. On our return journey, we decided to stop at Ambewela Farm as they have a little restaurant.  We had their delicious yogurt there.  We are not milk fans.  We were told one can actually go and do the farm tour but we were not interested nor more importantly had the time for it. Took the opportunity to just soak in the surroundings and take lots of photos. If you have the time, it is a good stop. This is a nicely maintained farm, where the animals are well cared for. The scenery is gorgeous, and the farm buildings clean (well as clean as you can keep a place where the resident animals keep pooping :D) If you are an animal lover like myself, it might seem cruel that there is a building that houses pregnant cows who are chained up. But, if you look closely, you'll see that the cows aren't that restricted from moving. These are a type of tie-stall where the caretakers are able to provide individualized attention and care for the expectant cows, and makes it easier for them to identify any inconsistencies in a cow’s daily activity. The rabbits are bred for meat which is rather cruel, but they are also being sold as pets. The goats are bred for milk and meat. Refreshments can be found in the restaurant along with a selection of dairy products. P.s: The toilets are not so clean An amazing view as we got close to the farm, the mist rolling over the green hills was truly picturesque. Cold... Misty and wet. Just what we city dwellers wanted. Fresh & flavorful cheese at the farm shop was a pleasant surprise. This is a farm consisting of cow, bulls, rabbits and goats. They have a huge area and have opened up a small part for visitors. The views are amazing and makes for good photo ops. they have a small cafe where you can buy milk and related items, unfortunately we could not try it due to the huge crowd. The best dairy products you can get. The farm is pretty small, but you can explore the mountains around and maybe take a quick nap in one of the fields surrounded by beautiful green mountains. Ambewella milk farm is On the way to Hortons plains this dairy is the only one that has a tour of the factor and the cows. Its is worth a visit since it falls on the wa. really it is knowledgeable place This place is covered with good scenery of wide grass fields. the farm is a well equipped place as a genuine farm and it contains cows, goats and rabbits. For a person who hasn't been to a similar facility, this would be good experience. But if you have been to a farms before, doesn't think this would add much of difference. Also in both the occasions I went there the cheese manufacturing section was closed. I wood say a good one at the first time, and nothing much to pay a second visit. We visited in late evening, But it worth money spent for tickets. I saw false information for ticket pricing in reviews. The cost for local is rs 100 and 200 for foreigners which is a fair amount. This place is amazing to take nice photos in a clear day. I felt like i'm not in sri lanka. Quite a nice place to visit! The Stud Bull! OMG like a Minotaur from Greek mythology ... HUGE! The fresh milk and cheese available there is quite good ! Can see lot of animals there. Cows, goats, rabbits etc.. We also can feed them. Also have a live session of milking. Very nice weather with scenic atmosphere around. A very good nature place is this even in the early morning when we are going to Hortan plains we can see anything it will be dark but when we are back from Hortan plains we can see and we can feel the nature with many dairy’s in the farm . Very nice a huge acres of farm but in the outlet is similar to a small shop nothing special like a farm outlet This is real scenic beauty with Grren Farms all around. This is actually a Farm for Dairy (Ambewela Dairy Farm) with Hudreads of Cows, Calfs. Farms are actually grazing fields for these cows. Temperature is low in September End with floating clouds on the chest of these Fields. Good place to visit once. You can enjoy Pure, fresh & hot milk & other dairy products at caffeteria. my family enjoyed the education visit of this place. Really nice conversations about what is going on. I would agree with a previous poster that more things could be done to display the activities though As we are a bit dissapointed about Nuwara Eliya town we decided to go outside to visit a farm wich was a good decision.  The farm gives a close contact to the animals and we think the farm was very well maintained. We all liked this place! The drive there was really nice (we took a tuktuk and the driver waited there for us, cost 2500 R). The Farm and the Milk Powder factory are beautiful attractions as well as carrying a big education value. They educate the visitors with all relevant information regarding the field of dairy production with illustrations and sketches. It is not at all great. Can be given a miss except unless you have small children who might be interested in looking at the animals. Infact they hardly show any cheese manufacturing. There is quite a bit of walking also, so not recommended for old people. Must visit if you went to nuwara eliya I suggest you combine with a visit to worlds End or Horton plainsSnacks served sufficient for meal. Wholesome andClean Especially educational for kids to appreciate the milk that they so much rave about (or hate so much). And for anything in the world don't miss out on the yoghurt you get there. It's creamy, smooth, well set and the best way to introduce it to your kids (if they do not have the habit already). Frist time I have visited and I got impressed the way thing are done and the way they keep the farm clean. Good farm with great location. But not a must see place In nuwara eliya. Better show cheese factory to kids in youtube rather showing it from the glass covered room. My kid couldn’t see anything. The experience of visiting the Ambewela farm is excellent.  Herds of cows, viewing the green fields was a great sight.  We can see different procedures for milking cows, making cheese, and so on.  It's a good learning experience.  When you come here you can taste the fresh hot milk... The trip to Amebewela farm was lovely with very picturesque countryside and the farm itself is very nice, but if you have been to an Engish farm then its novelty is lost Its very valuable place to visit. We went to different sections. Cute little babies.... they are wonderful. We also had fresh milk from the farm. If you're staying two nights in Nuwara Eliya, don't forget to visit the Ambewela farm. This farm is located on the route to Horton plains. Beautiful view around the farm, the animals are well looked after and a treat by the works. The scenery around is awesome and we enjoyed very much. This farm is high up the hill and it involves only cows. You will get to see the calves and the cows. The calves are separated from the cows. There are all placed in different sheds. You can feed them and nobody will question you. There is also a small shop where you can try their milk. This place is for nature lovers. This is very nice farm and around this, you will see lot of beautiful nature. This is a must place for photo addict. You will be loving the climate. Keep one whole day for this area as you will not feel how time will spend while watching at natural beauty This is a semi government owned farm operated by local farmers. You can see cow , goats , rabbits and bulls.  Very smelly inside but it didn't prevent me from feeding them grass  😊 I very much enjoyed my visit, which made a great contrast with the rest of my archaeological tour. At this altitude, animals are farmed like in more temperate climates. The animals are well treated, the place is clean, pleasant and educational to visit. Great for kids. Best to go early morning as they open, guess it's around 8.30-9am. Less crowded then. From Nuwara eliya town need to turn to the Nanu oya Rd and then turn left to the Ambewela Rd. Horton Plains also on the same route. On the way you will have picturesque views. One might think is it actually Sri Lanka or New Zealand. Wind turbines can be seen on the way and the Kanda ela reservoir. First u will reach Ambewela farm which has no entry, only a Farm fresh restaurant. Travel further about 7km, you will reach Ambewela-New Zealand farm. Tickets for a local adult Rs.100 and Foreigners Rs.200. Inside cows, stud bulls, goats, rabbits, cheese factory( only through glass can be seen a small part of the process). Milking times are 4.30am to 7am / 12noon -2.30pm / 5.30-8pm However we can see only the afternoon milking process that too through viewing glass. There are a lot of cow dung on the path avoid stepping on them. No guide to explain the process, even at the cheese factory. There's a farm fresh restaurant inside too at the end of the path. Overall good experience for the kids. The farm itself is very beautiful. There is no end to the lovely locales in and around and it feels wonderful just to be inside it. In fact, you will realize you are not even in Sri Lanka and maybe in New Zealand. Sadly, this is where the beauty ends. Animals are tied up inside with cows having pipes tugged onto them for sucking milk. Same cruelty is meted out to other animals too. Ticket prices are also way too high. There is a shop inside where you can have dairy products. Milk coffee is good. SLR 1500 for international tourist is too much when all you see is cows lined up in a big farm getting fed and milked. No explanation whatsoever by humans. Only a short video show. On a tiny screen.  Also there is NO internal transport provided. I would avoid it as there is a long walk involved if you have seniors with you. Unless you have a permit, you will not be able to visit the farm. However you get fresh milk and milk products for you to purchase at the entrance. Very educational.  A lot of walking .beautiful scenery of the farm. Well maintained farm. Fair stop over restaurant. I do love the green mountains and the view more than the farm experience. to be honest i feel very sad about the rabbits who's living in a small cage for their entire life :( We visited the New Zealand Farm as apposed to the Ambewela Farm (both are owned by Ambewela Farms) partly because I am a New Zealander but mainly because the scenery, apart from the farm buildings, is a snapshot of New Zealand. The likeness is almost unbelievable. We spent an hour walking around the various attractions at the farm and each drank a glass of warm milk. To be totally honest, a total waste of time... If you've ever lived in Europe, Australia or NZ, there is not even the slightest thing special about this place. In fact, the way they treat their cows is very inhumane compared to the lush and abundant vegetation that surrounds the ""cow feeding and milking enclosure"". Milk is 'alright'. Surrounding scenery is beautiful but you could really see the same elsewhere throughout Nuwara Eliya. Its just 30 minutes drive from Nuwaraeliya to Horton Plains. I like the restaurant just near the gate. You can drink a very big glass of fresh milk hot or cold for 70LKR. Best option is buy a milkshake for 170LKR chocolate or strawberry flaver. Farm tour also interesting. This place is best to relax on the way back to nuwaraeliya from world's end tour. I would suggest to go to Ambewela farm only if you have a half a day free and you don't have any better plans :) and only to enjoy the trip, walk, sceneries. You can catch a bus from Nuwara Eliya to Ambewela. But we preferred this route: 1. Bus N.E. to Nanuoya 15min-22LKR 2. Train Nanuoya to Ambewela 20min-15LKR (Ella train) (You can enjoy stunning views over farms, tea plantations, Horton Plain and waterfalls) 3. Walk from Ambewela train station to Ambewela Farm 30min-free :) (You won't miss the farm sign. The road is really well maintained, views are gorgeous, generally a pleasant walk) 4. Farm admission fee is 200LKR for adults, kids -1/2price Inside there are cows, baby cows, goats, rabbits and a small cheese factory. To be honest, nothing expressive. Sheds are very smelly, animals are a bit dirty, no information about the farm history or how the cheese factory operates. Restaurant didn't have any proper meals (it was a big disappointment for us as we planned to have our lunch there). Should mention that the actual farm area is well looked after. Well, at this point you have to turn back and take the same road to the train station. 5. You can come back by the same train+bus or take a direct bus to N.E. ** before you start your trip check the train and bus schedule :) Cool climes, Pastures more than green, Great place for kids and people who love to see the dairy industry indights to give it a go, dont miss to enjoy a hot glass of milk or munch a cube of fresh chesse Located about 15 to 20km away from the nuwaraeliya city worldsend road,. Ambewela is a dairies farm. Green pastures and other greenery is seen throughout the road. Quite clean.  There is a farm shop outlet if you want to buy fresh farm made products.visit if you have some time to spare. It was a good experience for the kids as they've enjoyed the trip to the farm really well. Very organised place and plenty of walking around. Here you could buy a pet rebbit This place is for nature lovers. This is very nice farm and around this, you will see lot of beautiful nature.We were able to see the milking and feeding process. There is a nice café with tea coffee and fresh milk.This farm is quite big.You can see cow , goats , rabbits and bulls If you visit Nuwaraeliya, that was a best palace to go. You can see cows, goats, rabbits, in there. You can enjoy in a cool climate. Nice restaurant in the Ambewela farm. You can enjoy fresh milk and cheese in cheep price. Lots to see and experience first hand. Be aware of the smell and muck! Uneven road surfaces when walking and not for the faint hearted. No disabled access and not suitable for elderly who cannot walk much I have been here several times and there's so much potential in this place and I do hope someone will capitalize this great opportunity. I mean the farm is situated in a gorgeous surrounding which gives you the feeling as if you are in New Zealand or some other European country. I do not give much for the cleanliness of the place which can definitely improve. However if you are traveling to Nuwara Eliya this is still a must go place. Well, I am not an animal-lover but then again what made me like the place was the scenary which we pass on our way to the farm :) its all green plains with blue sky! The kids enjoyed seeing the place. Educational and there are cows, rabbits and goats. The presses of milking the cows, making cheese is educational. What a time we had! Rolling green hills, chilly weather, good breed of cows, cheese making. If you like photography, you should not give it a miss! You can spend  2 to 3 hours there happily clicking away. Highly recommended A great place for kids and family. Lots of beautiful greenery and fresh air. Amazing roads winding through the hills of Sri Lanka leading up to this place. We drove 3 hrs round trip to see this much publicized farm but we were totally disappointed 1. No tour guide 2. Filthy toilets 3. Not helpful staff Entrance fee 200 rupees ok. You see cows how they are milked that is it. Cheese making through a video. If u come to this area better spent time in the parks or lakes or just drive around and enjoy the beautiful views When ever possible, I try to make a visit to Ambewela Farms. The scenic view and cool breeze is enough to attract anyone. I doesn't cost much either. Have good food, but the star attraction on food department is the Fresh Milk. They have also displayed all the products they manufacture in the food court. But my advice is to stick to the fresh stuff, since you can get the other stuff from any shop. Hmm.... well the farm animals are well maintained, little bit smelly but that goes with the territory I guess. Only bad think you can say is the ride, terrible road right up to the Railway crossing junction, beyond that the Farm has maintained the road well. So right upto that you have to stomach it and put up with the drive. Roads are narrow as well. On the way you can see the Ambewela Tank, with a small Dam constructed to hold water, to be supplied within the area. Road to farm is nice and very scenic, saw all animals as mentioned in other reviews, saw cows grazing in fields as well. It was nice to watch cheese making process and were able to buy chili Gouda cheese for tasting, which was nice. On way back visited strawberry farm as well. The road trip to Ambewela was a fabulous one! If you are lucky you can catch up on a Srilankan Railway train on the way. The entire farm is in a very scenic environment - very cool and refreshing. We were able to see large cows and milking plants. Of course, we made good purchases of local cheese also - which was too good! It was about 45 min from Nuwara Eliya the place was good but need a few experts to ask questions Can see alot of animals This farm is the worst farm I had been to. Paid 20p as entrance fee and no guide nor clear instruction where to go. Sad and tired restaurant selling cheese and milk. Not much to see. Avoid at all cost! We visited Ambewela Farm during our honeymoon and honestly wish we had never come. What should have been a pleasant, scenic stop turned into a disturbing and upsetting experience that cast a shadow over what is meant to be a once-in-a-lifetime trip. The reality of this place bears no resemblance whatsoever to the advertising. Promotional images and online listings show cows grazing on lush green fields in open countryside, suggesting a humane, natural farm environment. In reality, the animals we saw were kept almost entirely in concrete buildings with concrete floors, with no access to grass, natural habitat, or direct sunlight. The conditions were visibly dirty and bleak. The rabbits were the most distressing - confined to tiny, overcrowded cages, with multiple rabbits forced into each small enclosure, unable to move freely or behave naturally. The goats were kept in cramped box-like pens, often with three or four goats squeezed into a space barely large enough for one, including mothers and young separated into very small additional pens while the young feed and grow. Nothing about this felt educational, ethical, or aligned with modern animal welfare standards. Instead, it felt like animals were being displayed purely for tourism, with comfort and welfare coming far from second. To experience this on our honeymoon was genuinely upsetting, and we left feeling saddened rather than enriched. Based on what we personally witnessed, the marketing imagery is misleading, and visitors who care about animals should be aware that what is shown online does not reflect the conditions on site. To top it off, we found it extremely hypocritical and ironic that during our visit we encountered a sign which read ‘obstructions and cruelty to animals is a punishable offence’. If this statement were true, this entire facility would have been shut down a long time ago. I would strongly not recommend this place to anyone expecting a humane, open, or natural farm environment. really good place to visit but when the weather is not good the whole trip gets spoild. it is good for the children too. Visited with my family Good place but Weaste of time. Soo sting and poor animal but good for children education purpose I visit this place every time I go to Nuwara Eliya. Children will love this place because they can see the cows up front and if you visit during their milking times it even better. We only got to see it from outside. Its a beautiful location. Unfortunately it has been closed for public for about 2 years now as a result of the pandemic. New Zealand farm is a part of Ambewela Farms which is located bit away from the main city. You may witness a picturesque view of the grassland either side of the road with herd of cattle. The price for the tickets is bit worthless since we didn’t find much to observe; although we were exited to watch the cheese processing, they were playing a cheese processing video. But we were able to watch milking process and visit few sheds. The weather distracted us to walk around the farm. Overall, this is a good place to visit for people who want to have an idea about a farm. You are in the midst of friendly set of farm hands.Do not forget to visit the factory that makes ice cream and yogurt and the wind power stations.It makes you proud of what distance Sri Lankans have travelled in setting up farms to international specifications. To me it better than the farms of New zealand and Denmark.i have seen better green only in Ireland.Visit either ambewela or New zealand farms under one management and enjoy the beauty of the highlands Ambewela Farm - One of the largest milk producer in Sri Lanka. They produce, Fresh Milk, Curd, Youghurt, Cheese.  I saw there were Rabbits and Ducts as well. The New Zealand farm is located near the Horton Plains. They have a lot of Dutch Cows which they use for milk production. For a small price you can visit the farm and see the cows, the milking process and even a cheese factory. Besides the cows they also have rabbits and goats. We felt sorry for the rabbits, they were in small cages without any hay on the floor. But besides that part of animal welfare it is nice to see the cows and how the factory works. There are two restaurants were you can buy fresh milk and other products made of milk like cheese, butter and yoghurt. Except for the poor conditions in which the rabbits live, this is an interesting place to visit. We had a quick visit to the farm. It was well kept and a beautiful farm. Prepare to walk if you need to have a better look. Don't forget to taste their dairy product the yoghurt and chocolate milk. Check the weather, most of the times it rains or light shower here We went to ambevalla on the way of Horton plains. There are lot to see in  farm.  Different varieties of cows their breeding site,Milk processing ect. This is one of the places you should definitely visit while on srilanka.  Cold Place and so many greens with animals surrounding. Don't forget to bring sweaters. On the way to Visit this, there are few more places you must visit as well (Strawberry Garden, Lake nearby etc.). Remember to have Good quality camera with you it`s not a big deal and there are many Cows, goats, rabbits, cheese factory (we cannot go inside) On the way to the farm and surrounding are is very nice with the landscapes From the calf to the cow and the process of milking and making cheese can be seen in this farm. It is a good learning experience. You can taste the really fresh hot milk The owners of this property must live on another planet if they are satisfied with the appearance and condition of this farm. Serious upgrading and renovation is needed. The Cheese area is a con job and should be deleted ,the weeds around the public toilets and the condition of the toilets needs attention . If you are presenting this tourism product to the world then you have to spend your income on cleanliness and better presentation. I worked cattle for 17 years and I enjoyed looking at the dairy herd. You must upgrade this product ,get your staff motivated and get the culture right. The Minister for tourism in your country would have to be disappointed? Had a really nice time visiting the farm. Last time I went to a milk farm I was about 8 years old and it brought back memories. It is a nice thing to do, especially if you have kids. You see cows, goats and scenic views. The views you get on the Ambewela road is magnificent. The green grass all around the hills and plains with bushy trees to add to the beauty will make you stay there for hours. You can see the cowsof Ambewela farm grazing as brown white and black speckles far away.Very beautiful surroundings and refreshing atmosphere. Absolutely shocking conditions. The packages show beautiful fairy tale pictures but the actual conditions in which the animals are kept are appalling and unhygienic. The animal sleep in their own feces and are kept chained. The place is shockingly filthy because there is urine and feces everywhere even during the milking process during which the animals are hooked on to machines. The newborns are taken away and while the new born females are kept in tiny cages away from their mothers, a worker confirmed that the males were taken away and sold for meat. Even if one does not care about animal cruelty, the unhygienic conditions are enough to turn one off dairy forever. This place and the farm land reminded me my journey from Edinburgh to Inverness. Scenic beauty and the cows are a must see for visitors The landscape of the area is amazing, something really worth of seeing. It is such a shame that such a big company did not give any explanation at all on how the milk products are done or where the animals are from. Also the lavatories in the premises were totally dirty.  That place is where food products are made and to find toilets in such state was shocking.  Especially after paying tickets for the visit.  The restaurant area was extremely basic, again with no info on how the yoghurt, milk or cheese are made. We traveled to Ambewela the drive was really nice and the road was good,The surrounding area is gorgeous This is described as a New Zealand farm but most of the sheds are very poorly maintained the animals are kept standing or sitting in dung and filth a strong stench pervades the air around only clean shed was the one we're the stud bulls are housed An entry fee of LKR 200 per head is applicable for foreigners. There is also a shed for rabbits bred for sale as pets or for their meat. Best given a miss This was an experience for the two children as it was the first time they visited a farm. The farm was clean and the people friendly. He children enjoyed their visit here. the approach to the farms is very scenic, miles and miles of green fields on either side. unfortunately when we went the factory was  closed. The farm in Ambewala is beautifully laid out and very much worth a visit.  We travelled by train from Ella to Ambewala and it took around 2 hours of scenic beauty.  If you have never been to a farm, this is a nice place to see amazing green fields and some uncommon cows, goats and rabbits.  The restaurant offered some basic food and fresh milk along with other dairy products.  The cashier was cheerful and helpful.  It was a pity that there were no meats for sale since they had all been sold out! The other disappointment was that there was so much of litter throughout the farm even though there were many bins around.  Why do we Sri Lankans like to litter?  Let's keep our country clean please... A must visit for children. The experience will be remembered forever by children. Well planned and maintained by highly skilled workforcer You can see various types of Foreign Dairy cattles, Goats, Rabbits. You can see automatic milking. You can feed animals. You can taste Fresh Milk products. its nice expeerians with kids. specialy are you living in sri lanka with familly dont miss this farm.more important for kids. another special thing is around sceneris look like NEW ZEELAND mountan graas lands with milk cows. Entering into the green pastures with cold mist gives a great feeling. It's wonderful to learn about how they milk cows with technology. Seeing cows walking along the way to the milking area was a great opportunity. The Stud bulls were really big than expected. Female goats were kept in separate cages with 2 male goats on both side cages. I was amazed to look at the size of rabbit. Finally had the opportunity to taste fresh cow milk & goat milk. A great place to visit with your kids. This farm is a huge farm which is accessible to people. It charges around Rs. 100. But it is worth than the price paid. Absolutely worthwhile visiting. Very informative and well laid out.. Every aspect was carefully curated.. The animals were in very clean surroundings.. This is definitely worth a stop to enjoy a refreshing and tasty drink. The milkshakes are just delicious. Friendly staff too. Very good educational spot for children and adults, bit far to go inside and walk a lot, but really enjoyable journey since the climate is amazing This farm is located at Ambewela which is a few Km away from Nuwara eliya. The New Zealand Farm is a part of the Ambewela Farm which are both dairy farms. New Zealand Farm is located only 3-4 Km away from Ambewela farm. New Zealand farm rears pure bred Friesian cows and maintain a pure line of cattle The road to Ambewala farm is flanked by extremely beautiful mountain sceneries with pastures stretching as far as the eye can see. Hills, mountains, lakes and tea fields can be seen. At the farm you can see the process of making milk and cheese and also how cattle are managed etc. Although there is nothing unique about the actual farm the road leading to it and the scenery makes it worth your while. Nice Place. but do not expect too much as it not that worth wasting time. we went as nobody guided as to how is the farm Beautiful surrounding as well as the way..... It looks like you are in country side of Switzerland. Beautiful........ Ambewela farm is a private dairy producing different dairy products. This is situated in an beautiful location in the hills of Nuwara Eliya. The location is a 30 minutes drive from the Nuwara Eliya centre and for me it would be an ideal spot for en-route tours and for bunch of . Good for children where they could see the big cows closely and to see the cows are fed and milked. There is a restaurant and another dairy product selling spot. Overall it’s a good place to visit during your visit to Nuwara Eliya. Must visit place, any chance should not be missed.  Great experience to see the nature and farming.  Visitors are allowed to go inside the farm.   Cheese making centre is also avilable.  Don't miss to hvae a cup of hot farm fresh milk. Went there with my two kids and they had a good time. The fee for entry Rs. 200 Per adult and children free of charge Located approximately 17 km away from the Nuwaraeliya city Centre. This is one of the prime locations of commercial-scale fresh milk production in the country. New Zealand farm is also part of the Ambewela farm. So, sometimes the place is known as “little New Zealand”. The road accessing the farm has a breathtaking view of the lush green grasslands. Need to get tickets to enter the premises. A large area has been dedicated for maintaining cattle, goats and hairs. Visitors can see the milking process. We went around 5.30pm and there was one milking scheduled at around 6.00pm. There is a little shop to purchase milk, cheese and butter. However, does not have much variety or collection. Didn’t enjoy the tour after seeing poorly maintained caged animals. One of the main activities of a tour to Nuwara Eliya. I and my wife visited very close to the opening hours of the farm. There were very few visitors at the time so we were able to catch the breathtaking morning view of the field. Plus,we were able to enjoy without the noisy crowd which arrived later on when we were reaching the end of our tour. Animals were treated well. Some animals were sick. We did not question the care takers on their well being. Hope they are treating the sick, To be honest this visit made us quit drinking milk. There are 2 farms in Ambewela, one call as ambewela farm while other as New Zealand farm. New Zealand farm is the one you can go inside and visit. Place is open from 8.30 to 5.30 as per the gate and they got ample parking. There are many cows and cattle to see and you can learn the process of cow milking from the staff, if you go and ask. There are some goats and rabbits too in the farm. You can see the milking from cows from 12 to 2 pm. Its very nice experience specially when you have little once with lot of querying about farms. Our young one absolutely loved our Ambewela Dairy visit. It is a real hands on experience and although we there when the milking had finished we still got to see the cows up close and the different functions of the Dairy. The cost is 200R for foreigners. Children under three go in free. Only downside was there was no one around to answer questions, give u a tour, etc.  If this service was available then it would be 5/5 easily. My Kinds went crazy to see these cows rabbits, goats etc..... they enjoyed a lot seeing these animals being fed by the staff.... Nothing much we expected from the place than the beauty of the nature... We have not used other facilities like cafeteria, sales outlet due to the time limitation. But they looked fine considering the purpose of the visits farm.... Dimuthu Ethugala (A Sri Lankan from Kuwait) The drive to this place is simply amazing and so relaxing!! The kids enjoyed seeing the animals here and getting to pet them and also got to see how milk was collected and how cheese was made. Spent around an hour and half here and enjoyed the delicious fresh milk and curd. We enjoyed walking around the farm and see the cows, pregnant, babies & more. Unfortunately we cannot see the process for making milk. Also it would be great if they provide a guide or translate the words to English. I also do not like how they keep some cows in small cages. This is on the way to Horton Plains or Worlds End. The acres and acres of grazing fields are reminiscent of England or Denmark with weather to match equally. The farm serves very good edam cheese and excellent fresh milk. If you are a railroad buff, and if you are lucky you can spot a train or two chugging up a 1 foot to 45 foot gradient !!. Had a great time with the animals. Many things to see. Recommend a morning visit. Can a bit hard to find. I had visited this place in the morning when the climate was at its best, cool and drizzling. There were hundreds of cows grazing all over the place and was a spectacular view. Go there and get your fresh product you need one hour  max to spend in the farm nothing to buy you can go and enjoy the good landscapes For us, the view was very different and we enjoyed it so much, specially the way from Nuwara Eliya to this farm. Fresh milk, butter and cheese are available there. There is a minimum entrance fee, but I believe its worthwhile to go there, recommend this pl I thought I was in some temperate chill location when we stepped out of the vehicle. There is a lovely store at the farm when you can buy cheese and other dairy products; and best of all fresh full cream milk drinks and milk shakes. It is a good comfort stop from Horton Plains. A proper method should be introduced to discipline the lines at the ticket counter. It's chaotic. If the farm is open to public visits, it should be nicely maintained with guided tours in order to make the visit more educational and meaningful. This can be converted into a wonderful learning opportunity for everyone by involving the right professionals to introduce 'Method'. As it is, hate to say, but it's a sheer waste of time and money!!! The farm itself was great for the kids. The views are breathtaking. The drive to the farm was amazing! Never thought Sri Lanka would be part of heaven. the toilets are horrible you would think the cows have used it. no fresh produce on sale. conditions for animals especially cows are appalling with small spaces. needs to study aussie nz concepts to make it better My kids were very happy to visit this farm, they were able to see the cows in close and the procedure of producing their milk. I recommend visiting it. The most I loved is the nature, surroundings and beauties of this area, more than the farm, which is of course a good one. Spending time around, breathe natural air, the breeze, the greenery, landscape around this are is just amazing. A most to visit place. Just few kilometers away from Nuwaraeliya town. From Nuwaraeliya city to farm road filled with wonderful scenes. The area is also sometimes called ""Little New Zealand"". freezing weather during winter time. You can see different type of cattle and cows there. You will be able to get fresh milk from inside the farm. Green valley of Ambewela starts around 5km before the milking station where cows are kept.. was such a great place to be seeing cows and calves. They also breed rabbits also. Had fresh milk and bought cheese. Overall its a hidden gem don't miss it The read leading up to the entrance had very nice view I understand it’s a farm, but I am sure it can be kept much cleaner than that There was lot of people 1.	The place was dirty 2.	The cows are not cleaned 3.	The cow sheds are not cleaned 4.	The fresh milk had lot of sugar in it This is a kind of usual farm one would see in western countries. How ever, this gives an idea of dairy farm industry to the sri lankan visitor. Apparently animals are free roaming and seem to be well cared of. Facilities for the visitors are satisfactory. The place is located at  beautiful and scenic view area. We managed to see the cows goats and rabbits  farms inside the compound. the staff there were friendly and nice. its more or less like  a  mini New Zealand at Sri Lanka. For those who love the nature and fresh air this is the place to be at while you are at Nuwara Eliya. This is a very big farm with a lot of cattle but the problem is that there are no staff who guides or shows around. You buy a ticket and go in and then there is no one who tells you about any process. You just walk around and comeback. Not as much fun unless you have a small kid who wants to see some cattle. Went to visit as a family, and it was a nice experience with educational value as well. Able to witness the milking session. Good experience for kids as well and good place  to learn on functions of a farm. Better to visit on milking time sessions to experience that process as well. Recommended! Gross experience from start to finish. Beautiful grasslands but all cows kept in sheds. No human interaction, just a video and then walk following a line. No other information. Seems very cruel. Walk to the farm shop was nice with all the flowers, but barely any products available. Nice drive to get there but otherwise not worth the effort. The nature surrounding the ambewela farm area is a very spectacular one, starting from the turn offat the  ambewela railway station to the farm it’s very pleasing nature view to the eye. The farm area is sometimes surrounded by mist and the weather can be very cold. Even though this was my second visit, my family and I really enjoyed the visit, the cows, goats, rabbits and specially the milking of the cows at 12.00-12.30pm which was an good experience that you don’t see every day. Farm has a shop available where you can by fresh milk, cheese, yoghurt …etc. , This is worth visiting Really enjoyed our visit here ,very nice to walk  around the farm with amazing views across the country.Very remote ,our driver had some trouble finding it, and the fresh milk shakes in the cafe  are to die for! Please in box me for general  advice on traveling SL , Bespoke tours offered , Island wide with local drivers speaking three languages (Tamil ,Sinalhese,English) Visited the area on less crowded day and had a great drive inside the farm area. The environment, the air, temperature and mist was a great experience. Enjoyed the experience very much but there is plenty of scope to expand you’re business which would enhance the experience. Considering it is a dairy farm the ideal scenario would be to produce ice cream selling to the public. Also add a childrens play area and a tea shop. Please take a look at The ice cream Farm in Tattenhall United Kingdom for ideas. People will love it. Only downside I would say is the toilets. Not very clean. Located in the hill station knows as Ambewela also called little New Zealand.about 17 km away from nuwaraeliya city❤️❤️❤️ Being from New Zealand I was keen to visit this farm. I was a little concerned when I arrived as I expected to see the cows grazing in a paddock but this was not the case. I was amazed at the technology used.  The cows appeared healthy, happy and well looked after.  They also have a mechanical brush they can use to scratch their necks or rear ends.  :-) All in all I was pleased to have visited Surrounded by lush green fields. Very much similar to newzealand cow farms. Maintains well. Entrance ticket price is comparatively higher. Variety of milk products available at cafeteria, but not cheap as you expecting. price is similar as super market price. Near the highland farm, which is a well renowned dairy brand in the island. worth visiting this place if you are visiting nuwaraeliya. If you want to vist it, must u have entry piment  from head office in Colombo. We traveled to Ambewela from Diyatalawa and the drive was really nice and the road was good. Closer to the farm the roads are narrow and winding so if your travelling with small kids , suggest you give them something to combat motion sickness. The area close to the farm is really beautiful with flowers and lots of green pastures . The farm itself is quite smelly but I suppose that goes with the territory  . It was really sad to see the cows and goats in sheds which were dark and dingy and the rabbits in cages where they could not move. The cheese factory was closed when we went and the restaurant's idea of milk shake was a scoop of ice cream in a glass of milk.   Toilets were terrible. The only consolation was that the kids enjoyed feeding the goats ! If you have schooling kids, its a must see. For Adults its just walk to see some cows & studs. Nothing much to see. When the staffs milk the cow what i've noticed is they are not keen in following hygienic procedures. Its the cleanest and nicest farm I've ever seen. They deserve a medal. It's fan-damn-tastic. Hope to visit again They have cows,bulls, goats and also rabbits in this farm. This is somewhat educational for kids because they show how the cheese being made and how they milk the cows. There's a small shop where they sell cheese and milk. They also sell hot fresh milk which is very tasty. You should try it if you go there. I visited this place on 15/4 with my family. Went all the way. I saw vehicles were rushing. At the end there is nothing. They charge Rs.100/- per person to see cows. As there is nothing to do in Nuwaeliya, people go there. Only attraction is the path to this farm. Few cows you could see and there is a very untidy restaurant. This charge is very unreasonable. I do not know why they charge this to show the cows. it will be waste of time being there. Grazing fat and health cattle is a nice scenery. Cool atmosphere is so pleasing and wash away the weariness. Ambewela farms is big spaced out with greenery n hills. Pasture all around with cows grazing in the grass. The weather is super cold n too too windy. Amazing weather with the wind n rains. We saw cows n calves n bulls n pregnant cows n rabbits n studs. Very sad to see the rabbits in small cages. The cows were also kept in unclean sheds. And very sad to see the milking process of the cows. I felt pain and sure the cows too are uneasy when they are milked with all those machines n get pumped for milk. There is a cafeteria too to enjoy fresh milk. Can buy cheese n milk too from the cafeteria.  Beautiful farm in a beautiful place. Looked like we are in New Zealand when in Sri Lanka. This is the place where milk production can be seen of Sri lankans.Fresh natural milk  without any harmful chemical. Cold climate make rememer you  the Europia country It is farm with cows in 'like new zealand' landscape. Location is about 3 km from Ambewela train station. Cheap milk, yoghurt. Bizzare and recomended. LOCATION MENTIONED IN TRIPADVISOR MAP IS NOT CORRECT. Farm is not in Nuwara Eliya city! Just amazing. We were surprised how well this place is managed. It was very interesting even for us being adults. The animals are well looked after and a treat to see. The scenery around is awsome. Our hotel recommended us to visit this farm. We had great time there, especially our five year old girl. This farm is quite big. You can see lots of cows, goats, rabbits, etc. Just cows, they are separated as baby cows, milking cows and male cows. You can watch the milking process in certain times. Before 7:30am, from 12noon to about 1pm and another time in the afternoon (around 4pm). There are large fields that cows wandering around to eat. They seem to be treated quite well. They also show cheese making process but it wasn't working when we were there. At last, you can try their fresh milk, cheese, yoghurt, etc. with very reasonable prices. They're tasty except the milk with too much sugar in it. We recommend the cheese and yoghurt. You can spend two to three hours here if you enjoy every part of the farm. Was very disappointed to find that the farm has been closed since the 25th of January till further notice as precautionary measure to avoid corona virus spreading. Call before you make plans to visit to check they’ve reopened For those who have NEVER been to a dairy farm nor  seen cows or livestock this venue may  be a worthwhile visit. For those who have  best reconsider another option. A shame really ,personally  thought  that with structured master planning targeting the educational perspective,imagination , creating areas for designed landscaping and clever marketing (as an example to compare, the Jim Thompson farms in Thailand) this venue would have had better chance of being as a ""must visit"" choice as opposed to an option to consider when there is nothing else to do. The views at Ambewala farms are absolutely spectacular! It truly is a mini New-Zeland that is hidden in Sri Lanka. You would see cows, calves and bulls at this place and some rabbits too. If you're an animal enthusiast, this can prove to me slightly disappointing since the animals that are caged tend to be an unhappy sight. The natural beauty at this place is however gorgeous. If you like milk products and than you may visit this place. Located outside town offers large green landscape and fresh milk products beautiful landscape,all photogenic,u will see windmills,drink different types of fresh milk and flavoured curd,a good place. Ambewela is situated in the lush green hills of Nuwara eliya, ambewela farms are made up of two farms, ambewela farm and new Zealand farm blessed. with the cool climes and pristine environment of the hill city, we enjoyed lots.don't miss this place on your trip to sri lanka , Excellent experience to see how milk is produced. There are other smaller sites too with other animals like goats and rabbits. Amazing experience and a lovely your.! We were going there during the busiest time on April 12-14 when all Western citizens chose chilled weather and picked Nuwara Eliya for their holiday getaway. On the farm road there all huge traffic we had to wait 6 hours only to get in and out to city..there was construction on the road between Ambewela Milk stole in the main farm. Anyway, we enjoyed the tour and sightseeing. A special fact is they keep everything neat and clean including guests' restrooms..👌 I do not regret the price paid to see this beautiful place may you all keep up the good work and save it for our future generation too. 🙏❤️ Highly recommended.! The place like paradise. every yard is green colour. beautiful view. you can see cows and how they make milks. also you should buy hot milk and drink it. it was very Delicious. the cost per cup is 75 LKR. This place demonstrates how to feed cows by people and also feed people by cows. Highly attractive local and foreign tourists' attraction. Visited ambewella farms in June with my baby. It was really pleasant and very knowledgeable Had fresh milk and got to see the full process. Good place to visit if you or your kids not seen milk farm to know bit more about cows, milking process. Also have a small shop to buy yogurt, etc. We visited the place on our return from Horton Plans National park. This place is OK but if you are an animal lover or so, you would not like the place much. True that it is maintained in a fairly decent manner but when you see the animals in the barns and all you might feel sad. It's not like they have a say in what happens. Apart from that you get to see cows, goats and rabbits here. Also you can see the cheese making process. There is a small restaurant where you can enjoy  a hot fresh cup of milk which is quite tasty. Also you can buy cheese from here. There are times in which they take milk from cows. I think one is in the morning and another in the evening. Check before you go, so you can see it. On weekends place can be really crowded but since it has such a large area, it is not much of a problem. The place itself and the road leading to the place from Nuwara eliya is quite breath-taking. The farm has a wide area for cattle and goat raising.  You'll be able to see how they maintain their productivity. I went to New Zealand farm during Sinhala New Year so there were a lot of local tourists. Nevertheless, the farm ables you to see the process of milk extraction and production. A better environment with cool wind. One of the most dairy production farms in Sri Lanka. A commercial spot became a tourist spot because of the natural beauty. it was a waste of time. shop did not have any milk products. No service is provided for the entrance fee paid. it was not a pleasant experience for me as the animals were caged and are was not clean. expectation was to see some animals in hanging out free. The lush green grass and surrounding hillside is similar to NZ. A visit to this farm would be interesting for anyone who has never visited a dairy farm before. It was disappointing to see animals caged. As we have relatives with a large dairy farm in NZ we were not overwhelmed by this place. Foreigners are charged $20 entrance fee while Sri Lankans pay $10, which is a far more reasonable price for what you get. Visited on a very dull grey day but that did not spoil the outing.  Lovely to see the animals out in the fields.  Lots to see with milking, baby calves, goats, rabbits.   The have an ""interesting"" café where we sampled hot milk, yogart and various fried snacks. Take an umbrella and a jacket just in case We visited Ambewala farms during our stay in Nuwara Eliya. We went as a group of 2 families with 4 kids and it was extremely fascinating experience for all 4 of them! They drive is very beautiful and picturesque - with hills covered in mist and dotted with cattle grazing around. Inside the farm, milking of the cows is something you'd like to watch, if you have kids along. There are also plenty of other farm animals like rabbits, billy goats for children to interact with. There is also a restaurant/ canteen inside where you can buy food but could work at being a little more clean and well maintained. On the whole, would definitely recommend this if you have small kids. Ambewela farm is the biggest milk farm in Sri Lnaka .Its location is very attractive .I and my Family enjoy very much in Ambewela . We went to Ambewela Farms and paid around 200 LKR as the entrance fees. its hectare and hectares of property and has an electric fencing all around. They have different sheds for Cows/bulls/calves and a milking station. The cows are milked 3 times a day. We visited their restaurant and bought Gouda cheese loaf and had vanilla milkshake. All in all a Fresh produce. The experience of visiting Ambewala Farms was great.Open green fields with herds of Cows was a great sight to watch. There are sheds made inside where you can sew how the cows are fed and taken care of. There are many sheds inside which show you the different procedures involved in milking the cows, making cheese etc. There is also an outlet which sells milk, flavored milk drinks and different types of cheese which they make. Only problem was that there were not many signboards which could show us what is there to cover and the exact location. It was a very refreshing experience to visit the farm.  The landscape is extremely beautiful and we enjoyed a lot though the weather was slightly hot.  Be careful while handling with Cows as they get angry sometimes. first time I sow how is working the farm. how they are collecting milk from cows. not only cows there have Rabbits,goats also. The Ambewela Farms are located about midway from Nuwara Eliya and the World's End jumping-off point.  The pastures and fields of the farm, with the colorful cattle happily grazing is a sight completely unexpected.  The scene could easily be mistaken for somewhere in New Zealand.  Gorgeous landscape!  Great place for visitors to gain some exposure to a modern working farm.  Also now a 12-turbine wind farm established on site. This wasnt rated very highly by trip advisor, but by reading the reviews I knew my family would like it. We really loved the experience. First the view to the place was awesome - the greenery, the grazing areas for cows, etc. Then we loved feeding the cows. There were great spots for taking picture perfect photos. Then we had fresh hot milk in the restaurant, which i really liked. It tasted real good, and surprisingly didnt feel very heavy after that. Overall great experience. Those who are cow lovers, must visit. I have no idea why this place is so highly rated. First it takes forever to find this place and driving through maze of roads. Second the place is absolutely over crowded with school children. This is just a farm where you get to see huge cows. That is all! Do not waste your time and money on this place. Its cold outside and vehicles cant drive into the place so expect a very long walk in cold. If you are so desperate to see cows take a jacket with you and one more thing the place stinks of cow piss and turd. Avoid at all cost! Well, the place is normal. Nothing was interesting. You will see different halls/rooms for cows/goats/bulls. It could be a good place for kids as they will enjoy seeing animals. The way to this place is beautiful and there is some good spots for photos. We have stopped several times and we enjoyed the way. You will fell that you are in the plains of Newzealand. Attractive windmills and cows. you can purchase fresh dairy products. we can enjoy by working in the farm and we can have fresh milk and milk product there. those are very tasty Ambewela farm is situated in a isolated area. This place must be a clean place more than now. Felt very sad about animals (Rabbits and cows). Nothing special to see.. :-( but Sri Lankan hill country view is marvellous....., no words that is a breathtaking view....! Very beautiful farm outside nuawara eliya but you can see a lot stunning view in the way .. not tutor was available which is not good since you need someone to explain a lot of things,, they have a small road in the middle it the fam so you can walk inside the farm for 500 m only as it designed for tourists you can't go anywhere,, dairy products are super tasty we tried milk coffee and yogurt but they don't sell cheese which is weird since they make it in front of your eyes! مزرعة جدا كبيرة جميلة ومنتجاته لذيذة تستاهل الزيارة ،، موقعا خارج مدينة نوراليا بس الطريق لها ممتع وكانك تتابع افلام كرتون هايدي . Interesting to look at a professional Milchfsrm....you can look in everywhere, that is often not possible in Germany...therefore especially educational for children. But also beautifully located, 1800 m high...so atypical for sri lanka fenced pastureland with Holstein cows to see You might not be much interested in cows or farming but the olace itself and the way to it and beautiful landscape and the green pastures near to this place are so so beautiful that you will like to visit it again and again. Hourton planes are nearby as well. The location has stunning views, interesting educational tour for children. The place is closed sometimes, inquire before visiting. This was my first time and the discovery was really great. Organized. If guides were available its good. 3 Canteens are available. Have a great view of the surroundings. Mostly school students visits this location as educational tour. Its a place many visitors visit when they come to Nuwara Eliya. So did I. Be aware that you have to walk inside on foot, so be ready for that with an umbrella if you travel in a rainy day or sun lotion and hats/ caps in a hot day. Basically you can see farm animals, cows, horses, rabbits, goats etc etc, raised for farm purposes and you have a good hill country view from there.. and some grass patches to walk and rest.. You can see the milking process and cheese making process if you wish to, buy their fresh products from their outlet. The farms spans over 1500 acres of green pastures spreading as far as the eye can see dotted with brown/black and white cows twice the size of the average cow in Sri Lanka. Ambewela Farm and New Zealand Farm raise  Ayrshire cattle and Friesian cows respectively.  At one point you will pass a row of massive wind turbines lying along the horizon. Once you come close to the visitor site you will be teleported in to a remote town of England. Not only the weather and environment looks totally alien to Sri Lanka, the little English styled cottages of the staff,  meadows covered in important grass and European cows completes this transformation of the landscape to a little English town. Visited the farm with relations and friends. Located in a lovely part of Nuwara Eliya with well maintained landscape and amenities. The animals looked in excellent shape and well cared for. Well worth a visit for a relaxing time. The place was beautifully located, and had to pay Rs 200 for the entrance ticket. I think it gave an interesting insight about the dairy farms and how they function. The rolling hills and grazing cows reminded me of New Zealand! The farm is so huge and the green fields seem to stretch forever. The first thing I noticed was the discriminatory sign saying adults 50rs, foreigners 100rs. I don't care that it's 50rs more, it's the nature that it's intented. The farm was a disappointment, the only good thing was the glass of fresh milk. Don't bother This farm is good to have a knowledge about the diary production. really enjoyed the visit with a misty environment. 😍😍😍 the view was just woww.. loved it..the weather was so romantic... the green fields 😍😍😍 its on the the way to hortain plains...do stop here..have fresh milk shake or nescafe coffee of fresh milk Popular farm in Sri Lanka located in a cool atmosphere. Must visit place on your way to Horton plains. Paid 2000 per person to get in to find that the Cheese factory was closed, restaurant and shop also closed so basically just got to see some cows in a shed. Don't bother Plan to drop in at this scenic and wonderful farm if you are making a trip to world's end/ Horton plains. Find out for times when opened for public viewing to make a tour in the farm. Last visited 2012 A farm with picturesque views of green fields dotted with black and white cows and a foggy mountainous backdrop. It felt like we were in New Zealand. This is a very relaxed attraction. Definitely recommend if you are with children (young or a little older). The beautiful lushes green acres are a beautiful sight and the children enjoy watching the cows and the goats graze. You can also view milking (at specific times). In terms of activity there isn't much but for the money you pay you get to relax, walk around and enjoy the greenery. It's something which could be fit in to a late afternoon or early morning trip if you are coupling it with other attractions in Nuwera Eliya. There is a small milk bar where you get fresh, hot milk. Nothing perfect that cold weather and a nice glass of hot milk. Recommend taking a stroller for the young ones and jacket/warm clothing. It can get a bit chilly in the evenings.",3.9,353,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/11/e0/98/43/wow.jpg?w=700&h=400&s=1,0.641025641025641,15.384615384615383,2.243589743589744,0.9615384615384616,16.025641025641026,64.74358974358975
Arisimale Beach,"Arisimale Beach. Do you know how this name came. Arasi means rice in Tamil. This beach sand is like rice. Like samba rice. and i heard that this is the only beach where you can find this kind of sand drops. go and see for your self. Nice experience. there were many small ports in this beach are which belongs to various provincial kings who ruled this area This is one of a unique place where you can find in Trincomalee. Sand of the beach is really different from the other beaches. My view is that it’s better to visit the beach in the evening. It is believed that two merchants, Thapassu and Bhalluka, who received locks of hair of the lord Buddha have landed here. From here they have travelled up to Thiriyaya to deposit it in Girihanduseya stupa. There are a large number of archaeological artefacts in this region. Now a great stupa cold Thpasu Bhalluka Mahaseya is under construction here. There is also a very good Buddhist meditation centre called Arisimale Aranya Senasanaya nearby (Trip 0718562700). The sand found here is unique as it's size is as the grain of Rice. In Tamil Arisi means rice Male means the beach.The sand got on your feet can be wiped off easily as they do not stick on the legs like other sand. It is a small beach.It is in Pulmudai which is 60 km away from Trincomalee along Nilaweli Uppuweli road. You have to travel in a semi forest area to get there.Do not take the road leading to the Arisimalee Temple as it is not at the beach. You can walk in the lagoon to get here also as the water is not deep. Paul.udai has black beaches generally rich in Ilmanite. This place is a lovely one for a swim and it is calm and quiet.The water is crystle clear and not deep. Little waves are experienced. The view is also superb. There is a Navy camp nearby and you have to park your vehicles before it and walk about 1/ 2 km to come to the beach. This is a good beach just out of Trincomalee. There is a Navy camp so there is security. You can not take your vehicle close ,you have to walk a bit to the beach. It's a rare beach you can find because of it's location and the sand. Beach sand almost similar to rice thereby it's called as ""Arisimalai"" in the local language. The crystal clear water and the slight waves will make you curious if you bath there. Highly recommend to visit if you cross Pulmodai, Sri Lanka eventhough it's quiet difficult to be there. An unique beach with wet rice like sand which also gives the name for this place. View is superb all around. Good to visit early morning for sunrise. When you are coming from nilaveli side take the route shown by google maps if you are traveling in a low ground clearance vehicle. If not there’s a short cut as well which is also shown in the map yet not recommended. There you have a board mentioning the road to arisimale temple. We took this road and hardly managed to reach the beach with a lot of effort in maneuvering the vehicle. But all that effort was worthwhile after seeing the view from the beach. There’s a navy camp there and you need to park the vehicle outside and walk about 500m through the jungle. Good to visit if you are in Trincomalee. amazing experience, In srilanka we cant find any beach like this it consist with little bit large sand grains which not highly watered from transportation. Arisimale beach is a small beautiful beach, This beach is located in Pulmudai at Trincomalee. The Arisimale Beach is famous because of extremely large particles of sand, the size and shape of a rice seed. Located apprx 60km from trinco town. Welknown for the sand which like rice. Unfortunately we couldnt see that sand and no idea whether we visited in wrong period. However lovely beach you can see a black beach too..stunning views and itz like another gungle beach !! A unique place. In my first visit, the location was superb. But now people have spoiled the area with garbage. Still the physical formation of rocky beach is wonderful. Best at sun set. Sea bathing may be dangerous since no safe guard is located nearby. In Trincomalee it is beach beach every where. But still I feel the beauty nature has bestowed on each is different and each surpasses the other. I accidentally discovered Arisimale Beach while i was in Pulmudaai area.  while speaking to a resident of Pulmudaai in the beach, he suggested that we visit Arisimale beach which was about 1 KM away from where i was. with his guidance manged to get there on foot in 20 minutes. It was amazing to note the pebble like sand in this beach when compared to blackish sand in Pulmudaai beach. I found quite a few western tourist enjoying themselves on the beach. good beach like rice sand hide place in tricomalee 50 km ahead close to pulmudai. deep sea careful swimming Nice beach. Calm and scenic. The specialty of this is it has an unique sand type. The name it self says that in Tamil (Arisi = Rice). You have to go through a forestry path way for about 250m. But, the scene is fantastic. Most people mislead with the beach very near (beyond few rocks), but the actual beach is far. Accidentally discovered Arisimale beach thanks to a villager while wondering in Pulmuddai beach 2 weeks ago. It was just 10 minutes walk across the lagoon (water Knee high) from where i was. It's nice secluded path leading to the beach. I was surprised to see few foreign nationals were already having a swim in the calm sea with crystal clear water. The sand there is quite unique and grainy like rice. Very easy to brush off as it does not stick to your feet. I regret not going prepared to have a swim. Highly recommended for a swim. Please do not litter in and around this pristine clear beach We went there in April. It's a very nice place with scenic beauty. We took a lot of photos. Soil looks like rice. So it has it's name . In all of sri lanka this is the first time I have seen a sand which  is the size of “samba rice”, an unique beach when compared other beached around sri lanka  , finding the pace was an bit of a challenge cause there was no directions given to the place , there is an navy check point  as you enter the beach area ,where they tell you if It’s safe to bath in the sea or not. I think is an must see place to get an idea on what is written Although I was travelling with Sri Lankan friends it took us quite a while to find this place. To get to it we parked the car, waded across a river estuary, went through a military check point and then followed the steep and winding path to the beach (in a natural bay). And it is true the location is idyllic and the sand very unusual as it really does look and feel like grains of rice My only disappointment was to see the huge amount of rubbish., plastic bottles, flip flops and many other unsavoury items that had been washed up here - tragic It is not possible to explore the area too much as part of it is a military zone and another area occupied by a Buddhist monastery which is off limits to visitors This is one of the wonderful location that i have ever visited in Sri Lanka. Sand is like rice. access to this place is bit difficult by a car. But definitely a one of the place they you tryout in Pulmudai road, Trincomalee. A beach with sand looks like Rice. In Tamil “Asiri” means Rice. The meaning of the name is Heap of Rice. Please avoid the rough sea season Feb – Mar, then you can have a see bath there. However, want to be more careful because there is a Buddhist Temple where monks are meditating. Something unique to this place is it's sand, which looks exactly like uncooked grains of sand! The access path to this location lays through a patch of low and high shade trees. Watch closely by the military; this place is well maintained. A must visit! The beach side sand is exactly like wet uncooked small rice like keeri samba. It's nice to walk on the beach. However, with hot climate the walking way to the beach is bit difficult. Must walk through forest and rocks for like 10 minutes after parking the vehicles. No sand, sand like rice !! We went with five buddies. Have to obey to rules. There is a temple. Good for fun. Arisi means Rice in Tamil language Malai means Mountain ARISI MALAI means rice mountain This is a hidden beach you have find your way locals will guide you. This is also under the Navy protection.  you may find navy personnel patrolling this area. Beach is very beautiful and very clean and crystal clear water comparing with other beaches in this area (Nilavei, Uppuveli etc.) this is not very wide but you fine peace and calm in this area. Sometimes you feel bit scared also but mostly it is safe. There is no entry fees Its a bit hard to find as one has to cross a stream and walk through a thicket. Once you get the beach in sight its breathtaking view make you feel 'its really worth the effort' However the icing is in the bathing experience. The sand here is not the fine grain sand its the size of rice grains and I was told 'Arisi means Rice grains in Tamil and hence the Name Arisimale. We found it hard to find even with GPS on the mobile phone and asking people on the way. Finally, we found it and walked about 300m through a shrub jungle to get to the lovely little beach. There were very few people here. The Navy personnel in charge instructed us not to be noisy nor go over the rocky crags as there is a hermitage in the vicinity. What is special about this beach is that the sand resembles a particular rice grain.",4.5,32,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/16/e1/30/75/beautiful-arisimale-beach.jpg?w=700&h=400&s=1,0.0,11.11111111111111,3.7037037037037033,0.0,40.74074074074074,44.44444444444444
Beddegana Wetland Park,"Beddegana Wetland Park. Great place for a quiet stall and connect with the nature. Best place to capture some really beautiful pictures and chat It was best place to see birds 🐦 beautiful. Spend quality time and best place to understand wet land reserve and butterfly 🦋. Extremely different since this has been based a mangrove nature. Very calm place. Specially families with school children must visit this place. The park near my house.. It's amazing that Kolaba has such a green place. An environment surrounded by trees. Even when it is not raining, the environment is very cool. There are many types of trees. Well maintained. My favorite place to go on holiday. An awful couple & stray dog rendezvous . I took my kids & friends to see any wildlife. The park makes its revenue by selling couples tickets & they didn't hv the decency of telling me not to take the kids! 😡😡😡 Pls close this park.down! It's a shame to have it as a travel destination! An area in the city completely different to what people are accustomed to see in their everyday life was what we observed at Wet lands, Beddegana. There were many different ecosystems within this area, and vegetation too showed a significant natural colonization in specific blocks. Beauty of the site was that; completely different natural scenarios opened out further and further we proceeded on the board walks and pathways. It was also a place to spot many types of water birds. It was an extremely calm and tranquil area that helped relieve stress. ""If you are in Sri Lanka, or if you are a Sri Lankan living in a city, you must go on a trail with your lover and family, but only to appreciate the serenity and to merge with nature for a while."" This is one of the nice projects done by a public authority. Are you stressed and looking forward to spend time in nature or are you a nature lover or are you looking forward for budget hang out with friends??? Beddagana Wetland Park is the best place! Good for photo shoot, good for clicks, good for relaxing. Can spend all your day enjoying the view. When you get a chance visit the place😊🤗❤️👌 It's a very calm and quiet place. Only the sounds of birds can be heard. But its better to visit early in the morning at about 6.00am. So there won't be people around here. Well maintained. Recommended to visit for the peace of your mind. Located around beddagana Area. 100   Rupees charged for the entrance for n locals.we can spend around one hourin the place Very quiet place and also hugs of varieties of nature friendly place for all my lovely travellers arround the world. Peaceful natural area with walking paths through the wetlands & abundant bird life. Mini rainforest experience in Colombo, Srilanka. Best place for a peaceful day out in capital of Srilanka. Ideal place for bird watchers and photographers . Very peaceful place with artistic landscaping . Perfect place for a tranquil dayout It is a must visit place in Colombo for a nature lover. Artistic landscaping and natural surroundings blend perfectly to provide an unforgettable experience to the visitor. Identification of butterflies, dragonflies and damselflies is facilitated by information boards along the trail. Observation decks are perfect for bird watching and to enjoy the view of the wetland through bird's eye view. Sitting area in the front provide an outdoor class room experience, specially for the kids. Long walking paths shaded by tree shadows create an adventurous walking experience in nature. We came across few plastic bottles and polythene bags here and there on water bodies and hope management would take actions to keep the natural condition of the wetland for an unforeseeable future. That is a amazing wet land near by the capital city of sri lanka.this place very beautiful place for nature lover..specialy good for bird watching. We spent half a day in this park. The walks were mysterious, long and interesting. The board walks were cleverly entwined in the wild wetland. The wild life was amazing. A must visit for kids. Good for school kids, lot of trees unique to Sri Lanka with name tags. Few observation decks perfect for photography. Wow, this took me by surprise.I had guests interested in birds and a friend who is another bird enthusiast recomended this. A beautifull layout,  with raised walks right thru the Wetland zone. I was there by 6.00 am and it was a very pleasant 3 hours of walking observing birds, butterflies, trees and plants. Loads of Purple Coot. This is a must. A very popular park for morning & evening walks/jogs. There is a stretch out area within the Wetland Park. You may find a nice shady airy place to do some readings in the open. Very secure place for single women. No food is allowed in the facility to maintain its cleanliness. This is a nice park available for relaxing in urban area. Noone would believe that there is a park in this area. Good variety of different wetland plants. Nice walking path with several bridges. Have a large car park too. However I believe that the entrance ticket price is high against the service they provide. No even a good toilet inside the premises. I was quite surprised to see such a calm place in middle of the bustling city. It's very well maintained and there were ample places to keep you interested (if you're really into nature). Its one of the few places where you can be at peace with family/loved ones. First I need to tell that this is a good concept, mainly so close to Colombo. In early September I went here for the first time and I was really exited about the place. Then towards end of the month I went here for the second time. Then I got to know that they have banned taking cameras in to the park. Security at the entrance was friendly and polite. They were telling me that lot of people turn back on that they due to this restriction. Again I call them late last week and they were telling that only Camera phones and may be small cameras can be allowed to take in. If you need to use a DSLR or any other ""big Camera"" permission should be taken from their head office (which must be close during the weekends.  I'm trying to understand what is going on. To me this is a crazy decision. Beddegana Wetland Park is a 18 Hectare wetland park in the heart of administration capital of Sri Lanka. Bordering the Diyawannawa lake it is home to 100 species of plants, 80 species of birds, 50 species of butterflies, 35 species of dragonflies, 20 species of fishes, 10 species of mammals, 5 species of amphibians.

Park is included with wader scrape, Bird watch tower, camouflage bird watching hut floating deck etc. The trees in the park are still growing, but the concept is great. To be able to take your children to the wetland park without leaving the city, it self is amazing. Very calm place.If you really want to examine the art of the nature this place is the most suitable one. But when you visit there, keep silent in this area because birds get disturbed. For local visitors, the ticket price is hundred rupees. That is a fair value because you are getting mind relaxing time just for hundred rupees.There is path called 'Butterflies walk'. There, you can have an amazing walk with butterflies. There are various type of trees and they fixed a name board for each and every plant in that wetland. Therefore, if you have a kid definitely this will be a environmental lesson for him/her. An excellent place for bird watching and also just to immerse yourself in the embrace of the Mother Nature. It's hard to believe that this calm and soothing place is in fact located in the busy urban environment. Worth a visit by all means If you have a few hours and want to do something off the tourist track, spend time at the Beddagana Wetland Park. You can do a gentle walk through the trees and swamps on a raised platform, and try to identify the many butterflies, and birds whose song surrounds you. Very helpful staff. It's very hard to believe that such an exciting bird watching is possible whiting the busy city Colombo. But that's true. Spending the afternoon (3:30 - 5:30pm) here in Beddagana is worth. There are small huts made for bird watching. Also there's a bird watching tower (about 30ft) located in the middle of the pond. Information boards available wherever the birds are coming.

Please don't do that. Walking paths made on the marshlands do not have guardrail. So, children should be kept under supervision. The floating observatory on the Diyawanna Oya lake is fabulous. It floats but locked to the ground. In 16th century, this area was the marshland which was covering and protecting the Kotte kingdom. Ideal place for photography. A nice and calm place. Walking paths and buildings are well constructed and maintained. You can enjoy the nature here. Ideal for photo shoots and couples. There is a big variety of birds at the place. It takes about 1-2 hours to complete the tour around the park.

It provides a quite relaxing atmosphere with a perfect blend with nature. Natural surroundings amidst dense human habitat in Sri Jayawardenapura Kotte An early morning trek is best....stunning sunrise views if the weather is good Do ask for the map as otherwise it's a bit of a maze The best walk is onto your left of the entrance building, which will take about an hour This place is great for nature lovers. It is truly an oasis in the middle of a growing city. Kudos to those who envioned this place. But, we need everyone's help to keep this plcae going. So be mindull and look out for birds.

It's best to visit the temple site early morning or in the evenings as it is situated on a rock and the Rock could get very hot during the day time, but best be back before dark as we were warned of wild elephants in the area and we even saw an elephant near the road. The area is very peaceful and the views it offer is magnificent. It is popular among the locals for its historical value. This is one of the highly respected temples with a long history in Ampara. The location is very beautiful and is within a sanctuary (Buddhangala sanctuary). you may see elephants on your way and be careful also. It was very annoying that a Buddhist temple is discriminating visitors based on the social status (visible or perceived) to provide vehicle access to the temple.

Ruins at Buddangala Monastery in Ampara District - The few monks remaining in this monastery braved intimidation by Tamil terrorists and starvation to keep this timeless heritage floating. Princess Chitra established this 1000-acre monastery in 400 BC, after she left Anuradapura. The Buddhangala Monastery lies deep in the jungles about 7 kilometers off Ampara. The Monastery covers 1280 acres covering 5 rocks where the remains of the ancient monastery can be seen. This area belonged to the Digamadulla Kingdom which was started by Prince Dighayu in the 4th century BC. All though the beginning of this monastery is not documented, Ven Ellawala Medhananda Thero states that the history of is monastery is as old as the Digamadulla Kingdom. Lost in the history, covered by thick jungle infested with wild animals, exposed to the elements for over thousands of years, this monastery was brought back to life in 1964 by a young brave bikku called Kalutara Dhammananda, (incumbent high priest today) who traveled through the thick jungles and cleared the area with the assistance of Buddhists in the area. Located few kilometers away from the Ampara town surrounded by a thick jungle on top of a rocky mountain. The place is very relaxing. You have to visit there in the early morning before the sun makes things very hot . Hidden among a thick jungle full of wild elephants and leopards is the Buddangalamonastery, a Buddhist meditation Centre, which is nearly 2300 years old. Established in the second century BC by a provincial Princess named, Chitra;the ruins of a once thriving temple and monastery is found scattered over an area of 200 acres within the jungle. The standing ruins spreading across five rocky mountains scattered with ponds tells the story of a vast hermitage in the days gone by when Ampara was a flourishing agricultural and trade base in the East of Sri Lanka, then known as Digamadulla. The Brahim letter inscriptions on the rock face explains the procedures of building the temple under the guidance of Princess Chitra and the supervision of her accountant , a written evidence of affluence and opulence of the age old Digamadulla. The monastery had been built in and around a rocky mountain scattered with caves and ponds, which are now the home and play grounds of many a wild beasts. The temple which is found on site today is built on a mountain which holds the finely carved stone remains of five buildings and a ruined stupa, which is yet to be excavated. The half standing stone bridges and stairways suggests that the five rock scattered mountains found amidst the jungle were interconnected creating a 200 acre large monastery comprising caves constructed with the distinct drip ledge and remodeled with cement, bricks and plaster. The monastery which maintained a continuous Sanga tradition until the years of 800 AC were later abandoned due to the shifting of Kingdoms and South Indian Invasions. It was forgotten amidst the rising jungle and left for the elephants to roam for more than thousand years; until the monastery was rediscovered and reestablished for the meditating monks in 1964. The new stupa of the hermitage, which stands on a 500 feet tall hill top, is enshrined with the relics of Lord Buddha and his two main disciples;ArhantSariputta and ArhantMoggallana. The relics were found on site during the excavation of a stupa and are a unique and ultra-reverend combination for many a Buddhists in the country. Although the end of the civil war, which engulfed the East coast of the country for the last two decades, had seen an increase of travelers to Ampara, Buddangala monastery still remains hidden among the jungle, aforest hermitage of ancient tradition. Located among thick jungle and atop a rocky mountain is a great place to relax your mind. Stayed overnight though the accommodation was not that good. Excellent views in the early morning and late evening. You have go there in the morning as this located in a rock. When the sun rises the rock get hot.  I like the place  because it is a nicely located .

Christ Church Warleigh,"Christ Church Warleigh.

My mom, as a child attended this church 69 years ago and we brought her back after 69 years for her to experience her childhood church Nestled in between various tea plantations, our driver brought to our attention this former British church while leaving the winding road back to Hatton. A very serene church indeed. Truly magical place with it serenity and sense of silence blending in to the incredibly beautiful location where this little church is placed. Be aware all the time of the fact its cemetery as well where a careful look at the tomb stones would reveal the deaths of many young souls at the prime of their age- succumbed to disease it's said, when the mountains took a heavy toll on the a pioneers irrespective of the position. Photography  is not allowed so its best to abide by the polite caretaker.What awaits a traveler once inside the church is beyond description so better to feel it first hand .Caretaker is well versed in the matters related to the church. A little donation box by the entrance, so a little help in keeping this serendipitous place the way it stands would be the duty of a visitor. This is an very old church belonging to England congregation. It's beautiful designed and they have one of the Oldest pipe organs One of the best memories of British colonial life time and antique furniture and pipe organ with old bible glass painting are more colorful and unique best place to visit when you travel Hatton Surrounding tea plantations and great view of Casgtregh reservoir behind the church must visit highly Recommended Our group of seventeen travelling together as a group visited the Walreigh Church at Dickoya along Hatton - Norwood Road in the morning on 27th March 2021.  Our group leader, Padmini, had pre-arranged and obtained permission to enter the compound and to be shown around this quaint little church. This Church built by the British in 1878 is one of the oldest and prominent Anglican churches in Sri Lanka.  It had been built with granite stone blocks now looking ash coloured.  The Church is scenically located surrounded by tea estates and borders the Castlereigh lake.  The caretaker and sexton Mr Felix Coulton welcomed us, took us in and described its history.  Many tombstones of British Planters lie at the cemetery surrounding the church. A bible printed around 1865 and presented to the church in 1879 occupies the pride of place near the pulpit.  The stained-glass windows, with Jesus paintings, are attractive and livens the church interior.  An old ancient church organ adorns the entrance.  Wooden church benches and the pulpit too appear ancient.  Floral tiles, imported from England, are laid out on the floor. We greatly enjoyed the visit to this church located in picture-postcard surrounds.  Here, I felt a feeling of nostalgia of what it would have been! This small place is situated at side of Hatton-Dick Oya road. History of Anglican church goes back to 19th century but they maintain the same condition. There is a care taker to show inside of the church. The pipe organ (still function) and holy Bible (printed in 1860) are two special things can be seen inside the church. They don't allow photographs inside the church after Easter attack.  The churchyard is full of tombs of people of colonial era. You can see the tomb of first British Inspector General of Police at the entrance of the church. Paid a whistle stop visit here and what a beautiful little church it is. Sad to see the cemetery with such young people buried there over the years. Predominantly tea planters. The church is maintained to impeccable standards. The stained glass windows were shipped from the uk. There’s a miniature wind piano that’s 99years old with a larger piped organ to the rear. Well worth a quick tour. My great uncle is buried here, he died at 21 months old in 1898.  It was a powerful experience to visit here and is a beautiful little church in an idyllic setting. This was an accidental find. But what a treasure ! This tiny church is packed with history related to us by an enthusiastic caretaker. If you do travel around DIckoya area, please do  visit this delightful church. Christ Church.

It has a pipe organ as well. The gardens are well maintained and the scenic location on the Hatton - Norton road is admirable. We stayed in Dickoya for a few days and the owner suggested us to visit this nice church but to our surprise, they do not allow visitors in. We asked the guy who takes care of the church when we could visit the place and he told us that it was closed to tourists after the bombings that took place in May so no way to get inside. This place is a definite must see. It was so beautiful and so haunting in the most tranquil way. I can’t believe Sri Lanka has such magnificent places. lovely stain glass, pipe organ, antique furniture, serene and beautiful, located in a very scenic place, caretaker very helpful , opens the well kept church if required, Well we came from Hatton to Adams peak, it's on the road, we stoped for 15 min, it's nice to see such old church... this is a historical church & one of very few attractions in  Dikoya.  its open from 9 am to 5 PM & there is a Person who will explain  the whole story of the church. The church is one of the few near by attractions of the area. The inside of the church is beautiful. The outside ground is burial ground of many British families. Built in 1878 according to old British architecture  the Christ Church Warleigh was a gift from William Scott. Sitting by the Hatton Nortan Road just two km from Dickoya town the church is still maintained to its past glory. The gardens of Christ Church Warleigh rest some of the first planters settled down in Sri Lanka. Take your camera you could bring back some interesting memories. The the first Bible gifted to the chuch,antique furniture, old Piano are all  preserved to date. Stepping into the church was like stepping into my local parish church back home. The stained glass windows are spectacular & worth a visit for them alone. The Vicar was there with some local people cleaning the church which was very inspiring to see their care of the building The Vicar sadly told me he has the same issues as back home, a dwindling congregation & lack of funds to maintain the Church building. The roof clearly had a large hole in it. I wish the congregation well & hope it is still there in another 140 years (it was built in 1878) one of good place in srilanka nice place with green colour ,dutch church ,adamespeak its really good to visit The church built in typical old British church architecture is quite quaint. One can see the original bible that was gifted to the church. It is a quick 15 minute journey by car from the Governor’s Mansion. We enjoyed visiting this small, gorgeous church overlooking the Castlereigh Reservoir.  It has been very well maintained. The stained glass windows are original and it has two functioning organs. It isn't open to visitors everyday of the week, so it is worth finding out which day it is before visiting.  Good to combine with a tour of the reservoir. This is a beautiful small church built in colonial time overlooking the Castlereagh reservoir. The first bible which was brought down to Sri Lanka is on display inside the church. Original piano and the pipe organ are still working and services are still held. Churchyard has quite a number of gravestones of people died from 1800 s to recent times. Caretaker will provide visitors with all historic information. Pictures can be taken even inside the church. But, videos are not allowed. The area is quite scenic. If your are in Dikoya, this is a must visit. We were lucky and a very well informed member of the local congragation was there and invited us to give us a little tour. He knew all the facts the founding of this church. We went also inside and could take pictures. Many thanks again. It's a wonderful and old (built in 1878) Christ Church situated in Dickoya, near to Castlereagh Reservoir. The passionate caretaker, Mr. Felix will tell you stories of the Church and gravestones for hours if you show the interest. Inside the church, there is one big horn pipe organ and according to Mr. Felix, it's one of the five pipe organs in Sri Lanka. We heard that people from almost all the religions come here to pay their respect, and if you are to visit the Church, kindly keep in mind that this is a resting place for  50+ people died from 1800s to nowadays. small historical church worth a visit.  Services held up to date in this century old church.  A must visit when in Dickoya A really beautiful Church built in 1879 which is beautifully kept by a very knowledgeable caretaker. It could have come straight out of the Lake District in the UK with its stunning views. The caretaker's wife was buried there too and he is pleased that she has the very best view. Absolutely beautiful location and view.  Really friendly and passionate caretaker of the church who tells the story and show you arround. A picture-book Church in a Picture book setting.  Located over the beautiful Castlereigh reservoir, the Church has a 150 year old Bible and beautiful stained glass windows.  It is a Parish Church and also has the Cemetary/Churchyard of the traditional Anglican Churches.  It is not open all the time, but if you ask Felix, the curator,  is very helpful and knowledgeable. We walked to this church from Dickoya along the road and enjoyed the walk as it passes temples, tea plantations, locals going about their business etc. The church was opened for us by a young boy and the cemetery outside is still in use and beautifully preserved - interesting gravestones. It overlooks a huge reservoir which is very scenic and we walked down to the Tamil village below the church and were made very welcome by kids and villagers. We visited this church and it was like being in a small village anywhere in England (except it was much warmer!). It is an amazingly preserved church perched on a hill overlooking the reservoir.  You only need 15 minutes or so to look round and can do it on the way to somewhere else such as a tea factory tour.  Look at the gravestones outside as well as they all help tell the story of this little piece of preserved England in Sri Lanka. Very beautiful place  with a amazing view. It's very nice for a short visit and it's ob the way from Hatton-Dickoya to Adam's Peak. The gardner was very friendly. A nice place to visit when in the region dating back to history Sarounded by the waters of Castlereagh, afeast for the eyes ! Built in 1800s one of the beautiful Anglican Church with nice ancient architecture with old antique furniture, pianos and Gothic style art is something you can witness here. Located on the edge of the Castlereagh Reservoir and in the middle of a tea estate - the setting is beautiful and worth visiting. Few minutes from Clovefield Villa (about 35 minutes) and worth visiting this beautiful place. This area in Sri Lanka is so very picturesque and beautiful.  You will be amazed at the tranquill hills covered by tea plantations and the amazing clean fresh air all around.  We were very fortunate to have stayed at Dickoya while on holiday in Sri Lanka.  We will definitely be back here soon. Visited here whilst staying in the area, this has a peaceful setting with a wonderful view down over the reservoir. The church has many English links with an interesting graveyard. The caretaker and son opened the church for us to view inside and were at pains to help and inform us of the history especially once they found out that my wife's ancestors once lived in the area Visit and see the wonders internal and external of this Church from the 1880's......the view at the rear of the church across the lake is superb. This church has been built in 1878. It is well maintained. The brass plates were shinning and the floor was well polished. The garden was well maintained. I was there for a while on Sunday church prayer when visiting the lake view. It's a very historical and beautiful church, worth for a short visit if you have time. This little church was built in 1878 and is located in the midst of Sri Lanka's tea plantations in the central hills, near the little town of Dickoya. It is a very peaceful setting with fabulous views over the waters of Castlereigh Reservoir. The church has lovely stained glass windows, carved wood alter and pulpit as well as a very old organ that is still in use. This beautiful church has a special place in my heart because my great grandfather is buried there. Robert Calhoun Grant was from Scotland, became a tea planter in Sri Lanka and probably went to Warleigh Church most Sundays. He died in January 1915 and is among many other British people in that churchyard who have contributed to the growth of Ceylon Tea! This little church was built in 1878 and is still in use today. It is in immaculate condition. Outside there is a graveyard with many many graves of Britsh people, planters ,civil servants etc who lived here during British Rule, many of whom died very young. It is a most interesting place and well worth a visit. We came across this church by chance during our walk from the Upper Glencairn hotel. The church has got a pipe organ and seems to be a great place of worship. The caretaker was great in inviting us to visit inside the church. Recommend this place to everyone if you are staying in Dickoya. Touching testimonial to the hardships, the loneliness and perhaps some of the consolations of the Victorian plantation managers' lives. Nice Place overlooking a Lake. Fine for sitting in the shadow of the trees with a look over the lanke and the teafields. Place is quaint and serene. If I'm not mistaken its around two centuries old and still have the original structure. What I loved about the place is the sense of calmness and the beautiful view. Do pay a visit and talk to Mr. Felix ( caretaker) of the church for a full 360 about the place. In the most picturesque of locations, over looking the reservoir, stands the beautiful Warleigh Church. Built by planters over a 150 years ago, it is the final resting place for many of the colonial residents from that time. A must see on your Hill country Tour A place of religious interest - A 'must see' by all visitors travelling to or through Dickoya, Hatton The Warleigh Church is a very beautiful old church built in the eighteenth century and in a very beautiful location earlier it would have overlooked the tea country of Sri Lanka now it overlooks the castlereigh reservoir .The ancient anglican cemetery is also well kept like the church  a place not to be missed when in Sri Lanka We happened upon this enchanting place today on our way to our tea trail accommodation - I had mentioned to our guide that I wools like to see the inside of a church so as to compare with all the temples that we had seen. This pretty church dates from 1878 and is very well maintained both on the inside and also the graveyard. The caretaker's wife scurried out to unlock the church so as to show us the beautiful inside - a donation of 200 rupees was much appreciated. Very pleased to have found it. It's a quaint little church that stands on a hill. In it's gardens rest some of the first Planters that settled in Sri Lanka from Britain. The very first bible gifted to the church by the  Methodist church in the 1800's still sits on the pulpit. Go there if you like traveling back in time. We stopped off here on Christmas eve as we were in the area. The church warden opened up for us and pointed out the various features and toured the churchyard with us. A lovely place. The church gifted by Englishman William Scot (1878) is built like a typical British church and stands on Wanarajah Estate near the hamlet of Dickoya. We were the only visitors on a cloudy day, but that didnt dampen the beauty of the tiny church. The original bible that was gifted to the church is still lovingly kept at the alter. It is a great place to find out about your ancestors, if they were posted in Sri Lanka during the time of the British! There is a large pipe organ at the back and a tiny organ in the front of the church. We spent more than 30min inside the premises (the church door was locked) and on our way out, the caretaker, who had been alerted by his wife, met us looking not too pleased! He made an excuse to open the church door, but we convinced him to! He went on about the fact that there are rogues in the area and that they are very careful who should come visit! His negative chatter distracted us, so much so that we couldnt ask whether there were any prominent people buried there! I wonder if the welcome would have been any different, if we were foreigners! Every other Sunday there is an English Service at 8am.",4.5,65,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/14/be/cf/af/caption.jpg?w=700&h=-1&s=1,0.0,29.629629629629623,0.0,0.0,27.77777777777778,42.5925925925926
Colombo Fort Railway Station,"Colombo Fort Railway Station. We were told all trains were full at the ticket office which I subsequently do not believe as we were herded to the tourist office where lo and behold they had tickets. We were railroaded into buying a tour which was overpriced and not what we wanted to do. We are independent travellers and found ourselves unwittingly on the tourist trail. The train was empty which confirmed our suspicions that the 'train full' declaration was the beginning of the scam. The accommodation that was booked for us was substandard and we were not even told where we were staying so we could research. If you do end up at the tourist office, which is likely if you don't have prebooked tickets, ask lots of questions about the tour and don't let them railroad you into something you don't want to. I would suggest that you book tickets way in advance, perhaps book a hotel and get them to book tickets over the phone. Very tired, rundown station lacking almost every facility you should expect . Do not linger! Serious investment need ed. i am grading this station good rather than poor because considering how busy it is, it operates fairly smoothly in the general context of travel in Sri Lanka. The present station was opened in the early 20th Century and is the major rail hub of the country. Very many commuter trains depart from here as well as the longer routes operated by Sri Lanka Railways. Generally one can find ones way around but be prepared for crowds, a degree of pushing, and taking care. We took Podi Manike (leaving Fort at 5.55am) to Diyathalawa with a group of 16 including 8 teenage kids. The train travel and the scenery was breathtaking and the overall experience was excellent. We took the first class and the train was pretty much on time. Negative was the toilets which were smelly and not very clean. Most annoying thing was the hassle we had to go through to secure 16 tickets. If there is such a heavy demand wonder why the CGR does not put more trains on this sector as they could easily fill many 1st and 2nd class compartments without much trouble. We were leaving for Bentota and bought our tickets in advance, not knowing how it worked. Basically, only 1st class will get you reserved seats, but you must do this in advance and through an agency - check on-line. It will cost you considerably more, but its still cheap. Otherwise, you buy a 2nd class ticket, and tickets to destinations 1-2 hours' distant are cheaper than a tube ride in London. Don't expect to get a seat, but relax - once you get on (it may seem daunting, but just move forward), settle in a place (by the doors are preferable for air and views, but between the seats is okay, too). Expect vendors and some beggars to walk around and over you - the cut pineapple and pomengranite seemed safe enough and delicious. Note: Upon returning to Colombo, passengers getting on the train will not wait for you to disembark first. Look to see where Sri Lankans are exiting and follow them. Although it can be stressful, it was a pleasure feeling the air through the open doorways. There's usually a local hanging out the door behind you, so not too much worry about falling out. It's also a great opportunity to meet other travellers. The railway station has its own beauty and attractiveness. The booking clerks are efficient, fares are exceedingly low, trains are very frequent on the busier lines such as to Mt Lavinia while passengers do not push and shove too much. For some trains to secure a seat it can be best to board at Maradana if that is an option.  Reserving a seat is better but not possible for every train. On platform one there are good kiosks selling snacks, drinks and other requisites.  The language barrier can be present, so try to look for a man dressed in a suit or a well dressed woman as they are the ones more likely to comprehend English. Fort Railway Station is the Transportation Hub of Sri Lanka built by English.You will end up here if you take a train in or out of Colombo. Transportation is plentiful outside the station, by either Taxi or TukTuk. Train travel is a very convenient and cheap way to travel through Sri Lanka.  You could travel to several destinations in luxury and at a low rate using the Expo Rail. You can find a train to Kandy, Negombo, Galle, Anuradhapura, Trincomale, Baticoloa and Jaffna from here. Luxury trains with AC also are available here to serve you. Take care about your valuables from the  thieves outside the station. I have used Colombo Fort Rail station very often and it has been fine. I live in Kandy and work in Colombo and I travel home and back by trains and I have to come here as the trains start the journeys from here. Finding the correct platform and train seat was very simple.Travelling by train is comfortable and enjoyable and fast as they are not held up due to traffic. In most occasions, Ihave used this station. They will announce about the journey of the train in Sihala, Tamil and in English languages.  I have gone on train to visit many places like Kandy, Badulla, Anuradhapura, Matara and Jaffna using the Sri Lankan railway service. it is low cost and a very efficient way to view the beauty of Sri Lanka. The station has many ticket counters and all are numbered, Above all, there is a list of places they stop and the cost involved for the journey to different destinations.  There are different Numbered ticket counters for different routes and they are nicely notified by signboards. If in doubt go to counters 6 or 7 which are the inquiry counters where you can get help or even ask the schedules. We traveled on the Sri Lankan trains to Hikkaduwa, Galle, Kandy and Negombo and had no problems at all finding the train times and getting the correct trains. 500 or 1000 LKR notes are best for the ticket counters as the train prices are very cheap in Sri Lanka.There is a digital board displaying the time schedules of the trains destination at a particular time. If you travel to ""Nuwara Eliya"" you get  absolutely beautiful scenery. Cost was 2200 Rupee's in the 1st.class with meals and drinks. Took approximately  6 hours and I loved every minute of it.You'll certainly enjoy the experience. Train travel whilst in Sri Lanka is a must. Much more pleasant than catching the buses but having continuity in ticket prices and bookings does not exist. First class gives you air conditioning and generally a seat (not too crowded) but best to only have carry-on luggage. Third class is with many people as possible. Once you have your ticket go through the entrance and there is a large screen which will tell you the platform number, it changes between Sri Lanka and English every 30 seconds or so. When on the correct platform you can ask a member of staff which end of the platform the carriages for 2nd or 3rd class will arrive. Once the train starts to appear pick you bags up and get ready for the rush to the door. People rush to get into the train which is  no different to ‘rush’ hour at any station in the world. Keep your ticket as you will need to hand it in when you get off the train. The trains are heavily used in Sri Lanka so if you are slow getting on you may not have a seat. If so, and you don’t mind standing, you can stand by the open carriage doors which is a great way to see the country side pass by. You can either use the  website or instead just go to the station to book the tickets. But better to inquire beforehand the time schedule of the train to your destination if it is a long distance one. Try to get an ‘express’ train rather than a ‘slow’ train as they are slow. If you have the time and like the countryside, you must take a trip on the railways from Colombo Fort, It is worth a peek inside, if you are not traveling, there are public restrooms as well. I recommend you to start your journey from Fort station in the train to your destinations. Beautiful building still actively used since the mid 1800’s. Building itself is nice but operation is crowded and feels chaotic. Kinda dirty. Had a return train journey booked pre floods to Kandy for 3 days. Given the floods I kept and eye on updates and their website. Also checked with plantation stay we had planned. The train couldn’t reach Kandy but the stop prior . That was ok for us as the hotel said they would pick us up from there. The hotel and I kept checking with the railway and the website right up to 6 hours pre departure. On arrival at the station we were informed that the trains were cancelled due to line work ! We could have got the 4am train and we could get the one at 2pm . Was told at first that the website I looked at was fake! Pointed out that it was the same site I booked and received my tickets from! Then told that they don’t update the website! Welcome to the 21st century. The still manager seemed to find it all very funny. sitting there grinning at me. What’s more the hotel informed me that tickets were still available to buy for that trip!  The railway set up is a shambles , we had looked forward to this rail trip and one of the main reasons for visiting Sri Lanka. I understand floods can’t be helped but giving false and misleading information can. We ended up having to do the the 3hr trip by taxi. The farce didn’t end there . Another trip to Galle was booked (1st class not available ) . We booked 2nd class which should have guaranteed a seat , yeah right ! Might just as well spat in the wind. Still they carried on selling 2nd class tickets . Don’t bother with the toilets either , a hole in the floor to the tracks! We travelled rail in so many countries , this is without doubt the worst. Also beware of scammers on these  journeys waiting to pounce on unsuspecting travellers to lead them on to other scammers at the destination .. they work as teams . We used the old red train and booked in the observation coach. It was absolutely fantastic. A truly wonderful experience. We booked through agents so the tickets were quite pricey. Unfortunately it is impossible to book directly online. You have to go to the station to buy tickets. The journey took 10 hours and we loved the entire trip. Take along food and water. There is no restaurant on the train. Toilets were reasonably clean. Avoid the blue trains if you want an authentic Sri Lankan experience. We left 10 minutes late and arrived an hour late. The officials at Colombo train station were helpful and spoke good English. ambalangoda train station to columbo and back gain what an experience. The journey up took 2.5hrs on the train which is only slightly longer if not slightly faster than going by taxi but a lot cheaper. Reminds me of traveling on the northern line during rush hour as the train can get packed like sardines. Especially on the way back as we left around 18:15pm to get back. We went left out the station and headed to the Hilton for some lunch and much needed luxury for my fellow travellers then back to the station as there is an indoor market /bazaar which is good for bartering. Across the road and to the right of the station is the busier markets and definitely worth a visit. This station served the commuters who travel daily from their hometown to the city center every day during weekdays. In addition it also served tourist who travels down south from Colombo. It is a classic building with classic touch. We met there for a guided tour which was supposed to be street food. Unfortunately our agent here in Australia failed to understand that it was a public holiday for new year. So our guide took us to many spots which were open. This was a really great look around Colombo while it was really really quiet. where time stands still ... many old fashioned low tech antique operation.. but efficient and used by nearly 500,000 people everyday.. its an place one would fall in love with if you are in to it... felt like i had visited the Hogsmeade Station in a harry potter movie... i urge everyone to take the train ride from this station to Ella.. you will feel like you are on the Hogwarts express there is a local market next to it which makes this place a must visit, never went inside the station, but the local market was very cheap. Main station in Colombo for all trains.  Not as hectic as otsher stations we have been to in many other places.  Good to arrive early for onward journey to become orientated but all platforms easy to find. This train station is located near the Pettah Market where I could walk from. Traffic was terrible and crossing the street is another story so I decided to ride a tuktuk. There are windows here where I was able to buy my round trip train tickets for Kandy. It has some shops to buy snacks, public toilets and few benches to sit down while waiting for the train. Lots of locals use it for their daily commutes. Interesting to watch passengers boarding and getting off the trains here. There are staff to ask here about the correct tracks and train cars to board. I live in Colombo and this is an place never developed. My advice to travelers, don’t take trishow when you travel in Colombo, unless they are willing to switch on the meter for you. If not install Uber or pick me to your phone and order one. Train times changes frequently, so keep your ear on the speaker who announce the time table, sometimes they may not tell in English too. always better to talk to some passenger (a decent man/women preferably) and keep him informed that you intends to catch-up the particular train. So they will help you. Don’t worry majority of Sri Lankan’s are very helpfull and does not expect something in return. This ancient railway station is technically the main railway station in Colombo, and is able to connect you effectively to cities such as Kandy and Galle easily. This station is a turning point for plenty of srilankan's and foreigners as well. :)   Be careful with you wallets and devices :) This station does not have the flair what it should have from the old times,however one can see the busy life in a capital city's main station Old locs and trainswhich would go with the place are missing. Very helpful staff  at the station and  for round trips in the country try railway tours organising rail+drive tours with reasonable price and reliable drivers. They have their office next to the main entrance Due to major rail replacement work that commenced in January 2024 and is expected to last for six months, there are currently no trains running from Colombo to Jaffna. Although the main train website is supposed to provide updated information, it continues to show live running trains daily, which is misleading. Train companies need to promptly update their website with accurate and current information. I only learned about the disruption after visiting the Colombo Fort main station and inquiring in person, highlighting the necessity for better communication to avoid inconvenience for passengers. We had pre-booked tickets for the train to Kandy via an agency and had to pick them up before the train left and since it was a 7 am train, we took no chances and went the day before. EVER so easy. Just showed the confirmation details and my passport and the guy handed over the tickets for this and another trip later in our holiday.  We double checked the platform - number 2 - and came back the next morning. Staff were all very helpful and I was happy we didn't need to drag our bags over the bridge. Some other reviewers have said it's a dirty and chaotic place. Perhaps it's all about perspective. I've been using trains in India for over 20 years and by comparison, Fort station is paradise. We even had time for coffees and samosas from the canteen - which was a good decision as there's no food on the trains. Actually the station was the best part of the journey. Note to self: ""Stop forgetting that you really do hate trains"". Going backwards for two and a half hours in the freezing cold (thought there was supposed to be no AC in the Observation car) being jiggled about was torture. Amazing way to view the hustle and bustle of Sri Lanka. The 2nd class trains are pretty stuffy and from where I boarded (Colombo) I did not manage to get any seats. Had  to stand for 2.5 hours to get to Bentota. Not ideal for families or kids. Ideal for backpackers for travellers on a budget . Tickets are really affordable though. TIP: Go to the railway station to check on the tickets. Online site does not help. The train station staff were very helpful and. Took time to ensure we had the right time and platform for our train We recently travelled from Colombo to Galle by train with our 2 children aged 10 and 11. The tickets cost 180slr each for 2nd class or 100slr each for 3rd. The journey takes just over 2 hours. The train was busy but not crowed and we easily found seats all together. Its best to get window seats on the side of the ticket office as this will give you a brilliant view when heading down the coast. We bought some water and snacks before we left the station but you can buy small snack items on board including the shrimp fritters that are so popular in Colombo. This is the best place where you can catch any train towards any part of the country. Usually a crowded place. As many people, local and foreign alike use this place,government should do more for this place. There are canteens that you can get a decent meal but the public toilets are a nightmare. Authorities should attend to that to make this place a more pleasant one for everyone. The information center offers no real support. Some of the travel suggestions are bad-mouthed and attempts are made to sell a complete travel package including driver and accommodation. For example, we had pre-booked accommodation (Trincomalee) and this was dismissed as a very bad idea. (Monsoon, sea dangerous and the train from there to Habarana only 3rd class with standing room and completely overcrowded) The reality was: Wonderful weather and sea in Trincomalee and the train (we are currently traveling in) 2nd class relatively empty and comfortable. Our other travel ideas were dismissed in the same way. Luckily we did not accept the offer and organized ourselves as planned. My advices: Don't expect any information about train on it. You must only ask the people. So come erlier. Don't use offered service that tuk-tuk guys with buing Ticket on train. They said me, they buy me it cheaper for observation 1st class car becouse forainers have higher price. I used it, but they bought ticket for 2nd class for regular price not for 1st class! Ticket  seems same. There is allegedly tuk-tuk mafia on it. The old station is interesting, like most stations it is busy with mostly locals.  We traveled first class to Kandy, not quite what the photos showed on the website but still a good way to get to Kandy cheaply. We were a little concerned about how getting tickets to Jaffna would go after reading previous reviews. We were aware that we needed the ticket office near platform 17 and when you get to the main frontage of the station ( by the pedestrian bridge over the road) it is clearly signed. I would recommend getting the tickets the day before ( especially for Jaffna as it leaves the station at 5.45am). This takes the stress out of journey. Be focussed on not letting people direct you in different places, it really is clear. When you go in the ticket room the Jaffna desk is right over to the right. I think Kandy etc are more to the left and they had big queues. Oddly hardly any western tourists when we went. Next day we were off early and felt absolutely safe.  We were confused where to go when we arrived as there were a large number of people commuting that frankly just get in the way of trying to get in the station...another reason why you really should get your tickets the day before. A man checked our tickets and directly pointed out where we should stand for our carriage. Far less hassle than we thought. Be prepared for the first class being a relative term! my trip was wonderful so I like it, also will make it again because of elephants in Nora lay town,musume Hard to find the ticket booth. Try to avoid the infocenter service, since they will try to sell you a full Sri Lanka tour at very high prices. The law prohibits to sell endstation to endstations tickets of you are just taking a part of the trip, but they did it anyway. So we paid 1000 rp for a 2 hours trip from Nanu Oya to Haputale... Try to buy form the ticket booth directly or ask your hotel for help. The station is right next to the Market and a 10 minute walk to the central bus station (on the opposite side of the street) Well, it was not their fault for being on strike precisely the day we got there, but the place could do with a lot more cleaning and organizing... Too much dirt and disorganizing to take in from the very first day in Sri Lanka, I'm afraid. Still, if you want to travel by train to Kandy- the best way to take in the fabulous scenery- this is the station to go to. We got there to get tickets and ended at the tourist information center. Prassana there got us the tickets and recommendations for the trip we planned. He offered us a private driver and, even though it was for us an unexpected expense, it really was the best idea. The driver, Terence, guided us through part of the trip with experience and cordiality. We avoided long hours of transport and made the best of our trip. Terence took us to everywhere and gave us local recommendations, and was a great way to know the country from a local view. Probably not the best option for everyone, but I would undoubtedly recommend it to anyone. Thanks to Terence for everything, we will contact him again if we are lucky enough to be back. My friend and I are going to Galle and we purchased ticket for the express train to Galle. There was some technical difficulty as the car won't open. It took them 30 minutes to get it together to realize that there was no power coming in that car. Colombo Fort Station is the main rail gateway to central Colombo, it is the main station of the most intercity trains in the country. Fort Station is situated in the heart of the city, located next to the Colombo Fort and Pettah Market. This is very crowded place, therefore, no one should visit the station to see this station only to see, if not travelling by train. In my view, there is nothing special or interesting things in the station to observe. A bustling station with plenty tyo keep you amused for 20 minutes and some interesting framed photo collages of bygone days omn Platform 1.  I had the good fortune to meet the station announcer who took me to observe her at woek and meet her colleagues in the back office This is a very traditional but very busy railway station which is in need of an upgrade and  a huge clean up.  There was only one booth selling snacks and drinks. Following are the train fares to Kandy from Colombo Fort railway station: Inter-City Exp [1st Class AC – Reserved] – LKR 500 Inter-City Exp [2nd Class – Reserved] – LKR 280 Inter-City Exp [2nd Class – Unreserved] – LKR 280 Inter-City Exp [3rd Class – Unreserved] – LKR 180 Rajdhani Exp [AC] – LKR 1100 Expo Rail [AC] – LKR 1450 By far the best and cheapest way to get from Colombo to Kandy. If you splash out on a first class ticket it's comfortable too and you get fantastic views from the observation carriage. There are A/C buses but the roads can be very busy and the journey time can take anywhere from 4-6 hours depending on time of travel and traffic levels. You can also take a private car of course but you're faced with the same traffic/time issues and the cost is likely to be around 8,000 Rs. I highly recommend the train. As a tourist if you choose to travel to your desired destination by train, you ll probably have to come to the Colombo Fort Railway station. But often its not easy for a foreign national given the lack of digital or printed signboards or service personnel. Obviously you can try your luck asking for help from locals on which train is where, or whether the train is the right one. But always preferable to re-confirm with 2-3 ppl before you board. Bring your own food and drinks. Even if you dont happen to be traveling and say you are a photographer, the Fort Railway is an excellent place to get some snaps, in fact one of the best in the city. The building itself is historical, and the everyday commuters, the busy train schedules,  provide excellent subjects. Main railway hub of the country and terminus for all intercity trains. A similar architectural design to Manchester Victoria station in England. Well preserve old colonial look has grabbed attention of many photographers. However, food and sanitary facilities here are not the best. If you're strict hygiene concerned, better avoiding. But, trip to Sri Lanka is not completed if didn't catch a train from here to central highlands,specially Kandy, Nuwaraeliya and Ella. These are the most scenic routes one should never missed. Or you can opt for southern coastal route as well. Entire Sri lanka is well connected by rail  and one of the cheapest modes of travel. During peak hours it is pretty crowded. Wash rooms are not repairing. Unclean and very dirty.  So many passengers coming to fort railway station every day. It is very bad situation British built Central Railway Station with the Train seat Booking centre located for tickets to all parts of Sri Lanka . The typical British type construction prevails reminding one of the days gone by . The Railway Museum in the vicinity is interesting . Room for improvement and cleanliness despite the thousands who patronize the station daily . It was not very clean the infrastructure was shabby, the announcements are not clear. no clear signages to understand about the train movements. if you are a tourist you need to try your luck. Firstly, the population that uses trains has probably not increased since the Brits first built this thing. It is so much fun to see the station in almost its original beauty and with so few people around (it seems no one uses the trains), it allows you to explore the place at your own pace taking in every little detail. Great place if you like going back in time every now and then :) Caught the train from Colombo to Kandy.   Great part of our adventure of touring Sri Lanka - albeit dirty, noisy and definitely no class system at all.... but a great way to travel as driving takes forever.  We pre-booked the 1st class observation carriage on-line at home - you get reserved seats which is a MUST if you are joining these hectic, hot and overcrowded trains, and you pick the tickets up at the station.  Comfy enough seats - good views along the way.  An experience not to miss.  And oh so cheap.   1st class less than a Fiver.... The station is in the Pettah area which is a wonderful crazy, busy market. Spent a couple of hours wandering around and being assailed by the noise and general chaos - wonderful if you want to break away from traditional tourist activities Its interesting to know about the public lifestyle of Sri Lankans. Most of the people come for work daily use the railway from very far from Colombo. Fort Railway Station is a major rail hub and the main rail gateway to central Colombo (here most intercity trains running over the country end) For the information, Fort Station is a couple kilometres away from Maradana Station, the other major rail station in Colombo. USEFUL & PRO TIP Not many people knows that in Colombo there are also metered tuk-tuks, which are the fairest way to move around the city. Therefore, make yourself sure to get on one of these if you want to avoid to be ripped off. The only way to travel to out stations through trains. Beware of pickpocketers as they are almost everywhere. In Sri Lanka people mostly use trains because of low cost and fast transportation. But it has limited locations to travel by train. But if you will travel by train it will be great experience. 1 of the centres of Colombo. As a tourist train journeys is 1 of the best ways to travel around Sri Lanka. Trains from here go everywhere in Sri Lanka connected by train. I found biking a train here pretty easy and people here speak good English. If you arrive here ton of tuk-tuks and buses to bring you anywhere in Colombo. All long distance trains which include trains down South , up North to Jaffna and to the Central Hills start here. Train travel is the cheapest.  Very good value for money even if you book 1st class with AC. 2nd class (without AC) is equally comfortable if you are travelling to the cool climate of the hills. It's best to book online before travelling as trains tend to get crowded. ...3rd class travellers often have to stand. It's a great place to people watch as busy commuters come into the city to work and families with kids go on trips in the school holidays. ... all long far trains are starting from colombo,specially upcountry, north east and east,well schedule I travelled by train to Kandy from Colombo. We booked in advance through Expo rail. Glad I did because not everyone got tickets, but saying that we were travelling 1st class and most locals travel 2nd or 3rd. Finding the expo rail ticket counter was a little difficult but we we asked at a counter they were super friendly and helpful. Expo Rail is counter 17. It is behind a door unlike all the other counters. There were people everywhere but it was easy to find our platform and felt safe. Train travel in Sri Lanka is an experience and think everyone should do it. It is as busy as any other station but the streets are covered with stalls and there are no decent restaurants near the station.. However, the staff of the station is very tourist friendly and helpful.. Had been there to catch the rajdhani express for Kandy. It is not a tourist attraction. If you are travelling from the Colombo to any city via train then probably the station you could catch the train is Colombo fort.there are 9 platform available and each have been numbered . Once you enter to the station on the 4 rd platform you could found the digital railway time table and it includes the train destaination ,departure time and the platform number which train arrived. When it comes to sanitary facilities ghee are number of toilets avaialable and the toilets in the first platform are clean compared to others.there are 2 rest rooms for ladies and gents separately. Also 2 canteens available in the 3 rd platform. We used the Colombo Fort Railway Station to travel to Kandy. We had already reserved seats online but as you need to exchange the online booking confirmation for tickets to travel we had to wait for the sales desk to open. We arrived at 6am (our train was scheduled to leave at 7am). The sales office opened at 6am but no one came to the desk until 0640hrs! There was a mad dash and lots of pushing and shoving but we did manage to get our tickets and the staff on the platform and on the train were very helpful. This is the main railway station of sri lanka and connects you with ella and galle. Come early to get tickets, well organised From the Colombo Fort Railway Station we took the train to Kandy. It took us like 10 minutes to find the right Gate... As soon as the train arrived, everyone ran to get a place- luckily we booked some private seats! At the trains door was a man, telling us where our seats are (thought this was a staff member...) but as soon as everyone was sitting, he went around, signing that he is deaf, working in a deaf school and wants/needs money... no problem- but the way he did was just unreasenable! We gave him 1000 Rupees but then he looked as this wasnt enough for him! It is quite an experience to take the train in Sri Lanka. This train station is much bigger than the one in Nuwara Eliya, you can see the lotus tower from the platforms, quite busy as well, there are trains going to almost anywhere. The coast line is pretty, also a little sad to see those roughly built houses... we stopped at a station that’s about 1 h away from Colombo, the ride going there was nice, train was not crowded at all, a lot of empty seats, but the ride back to Colombo was packed, so if you want to do that be prepared. The station looks really old, some trains are rusty from inside out, but they are still running, and look beautiful in a photo. I believe time has filled this place with stories, go and feel it yourself. Main station in sri lanka. cleanliness is really poor. Have to make this place more pleasant coz we are a tourist destination The Fort Station has a rustic and olden age feel, but the services and standard of the station and Sri Lankan trains need to Improve slot. Don't even think of using the washroom at this place. This is the central of all trains and the trains in Sri Lanka is really cheap but they are without aircond. It can get really crowded. I ended up sitting on the floor of the train but it isnt too dirty. As for this station, it is near Pettah Market area. Everything is nearby too, the Dutch Hospital Mall, Ministry of Crab in Dutch Hospital and Crescat Mall. You can very well get a cheap tuktuk to get you anywhere nearby or just take a train. We also went to Kandy from here. Second class (sat on the floor) was 40LKR. To get to Kompanna Vidya where our hotel is was 10LKR. Even if you dislike the hot crowded trains, try experiencing it at least once. It is safe. You can walk around Colombo Fort area. There are a lot of stalls nearby selling fruits, food, juice, cloth, handmade crafts etc. Visited colombo in the month of Jan. Colombo fort station is a busy station. Went for a small ride in the coastal line. The stations in the coastal lines are old but with wi fi :) Looks like malgudi days station. My friends from India could relate. The train line is actually on the coast, you can see the sea on one side of the train, and road on the other side. Loved the sunset view from train. There are shops near fort station where yoy can buy leather staff and magnets and other souveniers for really good deals. ENSURE THAT IF YOU ARE TRAVELLING BY AN AUTO, ALWAYS GO BY METER. Built by the British, so fairly functional and durable, but in need of upkeep. Could also do with (clearer) English signs and announcements and more food/drink stalls at all times of the day and night. Very clean though, compared to a lot of other stations in South Asia. Surrounding region has street markets that are worth a visit. We just went to see what goes on with the trains in Sri Lanka.  It was interesting.  There are 3 or 4 classes of trains, and they all pretty much are old, dirty and run down.  The lower class ones are over crowded with people hanging out of the doors.  There is no air conditioning on these.  We saw children run up to both sides of the train while it was moving to jump on-- very dangerous.  Lots of people run into the station after work, This is the main train station to get on regional or local trains. Very few people talk English. The ticket counters are marked but once you get the ticket it is basically just finding some local person who can help figure out your train. No announcement in English and no boards in English. The station itself is very dark and most trains have no lights till they are ready to leave. We had to go there a couple of times and every time it was the same. Give enough buffer time the first time you get there as it can be a bit overwhelming. And be ready to carry your bags as they do not have ramps to drag the bags. We planned to take the train to Galle the next day, so we went to the train station the day before to buy tickets. The counter guy said twe can only buy tickets on the day itself. he advised us to come 30min-1hr before departing time. We came the following day at 8.30am for the train at 10am. Ticket price to Galle has now been revised to LKR240/pax instead of 180. We were hungry but didn't see any decent food, I bought some biscuits from the uncle cart. If can, avoid going to the toilet here, it's bloody disgusting. It's so aweful I can't even describe it. YEK x10000000000! When the train arrives, everyone starts rushing in like a very hungry mongrel who just saw a piece of meat. If you are slow you are left to stand, we had to stand :/ We were standing at the hallway, it was HOT and cramp; vendors kept walking up and down selling their food/bread/drinks. Not once, twice but soooo many times, it's already so cramp that you barely have space to stand and they kept passing by so many times and you have to give space when there are none. At one point I had to stick my face to the wall to make way for them. We had 2 big luggages with us, we had to also keep moving them around. Finally when a few passengers left, we stack up the luggages lying down on the floor on top of each other and sat on it. And finally when the 2 guys who were sitting on the steps on the stairs left, I quickly took a seat. It was interesting (not as cooling as I hoped). I could never have done this back in Malaysia. Finally we arrived in Galle, we took a Tuk Tuk to our hotel in the fort. I swear tuk tuks' exist to suck you dry, they charged LKR300 for 5mins ride. Every time is there some chaos, every time they are here full trains and lost soul of tourists, bad place for quiet time, refreshment because hot, nerveous and full of wandering people. Informations for foreginers are oriented on best Class of train many times II.class, but it means propeller and higher price. If You need anything ask anybody and maybe You get help. It is some policemans and some watch mans, but they controll the entries and some system only. Forgot colonial times... This railway station is at the heart of the Sri Lankan rail network and is in desperate need of a spruce up. The station is very crowded. The ticket queues were long even mid afternoon. If you like trains as I do then a look is probably what you will want to do. Don’t bother if you do not like trains or do not plan to take a rail journey. Beware of the tuk tuk drivers around the station. No meter and can’t be trusted. ware of men saying they don’t want your money and showing you the way and then suddenly your in a Tuk Tuk and they want you to pay. It’s a SCAM. Don’t stand here with a map open. Not everyone in Colombo is a crook! The fort is over the river from the Station. Turn left as you leave. located right in the middle of city centre with bus terminal just beside it that makes this area crowded and messy The station was opened in around 1908 or 1910 by the British who established the rail network around Sri Lanka. It basically hasn't changed since that time. It is a good example of the architecture of the time. Good to visit if you are interested in trains. The signs tend to be in Singhalese and Tamil with English a poor third so be careful when buying tickets. The view from the bridge across the main road outside of the local markets is good. As far as stations go, for tourists, this station could really be improved. Upon entry you get told verbally where to catch your train, but there are no signs on the platforms telling you which train departs where. I started to worry when someone asked me if we were catching a train to a different place, I was worried we were not on the right platform. It was early in the morning when we visited, so did not get a chance to take photos, but it is pretty old and I'm sure if you go in the day it might be a good place for some decent photos. In the station, a public space and next to a small police station, there is a place, called Railway Tourist Information Service, where they don't give information and they just sell tours. Unfortunately, we believed the owner, called Sampath, and it was all a scam. They kept all our money, and they closed the place the day we have arranged a meeting in order to get our money back. He didn´t answer the phone or the emails, and the police next to this place did nothing. We wanted to make a legal denounce so we went to the police station, and they just starting saying it was our fault because we believe in that guy. PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE! I was at the rail station to catch up the train to Ella. It was a very busy rail station and the information centre for tourist was very helpful. The rail station was in average condition, cleanness, and waiting room. Toilets weren't regularly cleaned. But the staff and the other people were really nice, always smile and friendly. This station belongs to the colonial period i guess. If you want to touch the local life and feelings you should go there bit early, sit back aside and look around. Heaving mass of people. Great old building. Take a Tuk Tukto the railway museum round the corner....that is interesting and if you are British you could feel good and proud. This particular location is very busy throughout day and night. The station does appear very crowded but no beggars, litters or pick picketers.  All look happy, smiling and singing some songs or humming....The King Coconut is full of morning commuters, travellers and general public. Variety of food snacks, imported goods, toys, perfumes, bags leather shoes belts are available at bargaining prices without war of words or compulsions The main Railway station of the country. Not amazingly well organized, but it really is well organized on kind of a level. You can grab a quick bite, breakfast of snacks at the railway(saves you time). And the tickets are much cheaper compared to other transportation methods. If you've never been to a South Asian country, then this station epitomised everything that is chaotic and fun about them. There are actually signs for destinations, for times and prices. For Kandy, go to counter 17. Facilities and information are South Asian average. There's plenty of eateries of questionable hygiene just outside the station as well as tuck took drivers ready to rip off tourists. Trains are slow and always late, and runs a close battle with buses for for second place as an means of efficient point to point travel in Sri Lanka. If you wanna travel with trains in Sri Lanka and if you're in Colombo, this is where it all starts. Located on the opposite side of the central bus station, it pretty much stands out of the crowd and anyone would know this place. I actually used this station as a landmark to find my way for many time in Colombo. I traveled to Galle and came back from Kandy using this station. There are food court and standard bathrooms available here. Once we knew we wanted to ride the old train from Colombo-Kandy, we searched online for how to purchase tickets.  It's highly recommended to purchase them a month prior to your travel day, as the 1st and 2nd class seat tickets usually sell out quickly.  With the help of our Colombo hotel staff, our tickets were purchased for the exact train #, date and time I wanted.  It's important to research all that in advance so you have seats on the train you want, because there are not only many date/time options but also many different types of train options and also many seating options.  If you don't research this in advance and (ideally) purchase your tickets in advance, you may have a lot of stress trying to do this at the station - many locals have limited English-speaking abilities and they may not understand what you want.  So you may be on a train to somewhere other than where you want to go! Once at the station, with tickets in hand, we didn't know where to board the train for closest access to our seats.  With the help of a local many who was mute, we got on the correct train car (he later asked for a donation to his mute organization).  The trains arrive/depart pretty much on schedule, which is good, as long as you make it on board! The Colombo Fort Railway station is in Olcott Mawatha Road and a major rail hub in Colombo. It is the main rail station to central Colombo and the terminus of most intercity trains; and served by Sri Lanka Railways. The present station was opened in 1917,constructed similar to Manchester Victoria station Britain and built on land reclaimed from the beira Lake. I am not sure I would have gone to visit as a standalone attraction but as our train from Bentota terminated here so we had a look see - the station has a lot of history with some interesting architecture, if you are planning a train journey and traveling light come a bit early and have a look around - get a good spot for a coffee and enjoy the views. The authorities can improve by heaps. Not maintained clean. Staff are complacent. Not friendly at service. The station is very old and not maintained well, poor management,especially the toilets are disgusting, can not go inside as it’s smell so bad can’t beeath when inside, next platform also the air polluted by the bad smell in toilets,please do  something to go beyond this terrible situation,, Thank you I wouldnt recommend it, unless you havent seen any old trains. Its not ornamental nor does it have any unusal architectural features worth the visit. But i would recommend taking a train ride! We booked 2nd Class reserved seats from Colombo Fort Station to Kandi by making a phone call to the Fort Railway Station. We were quoted the correct price, given a receipt number and informed that we could pick the tickets up on arrival at the railway station. We travelled by taxi from our accommodation in Negombo, heavily laden with backpacks and additional day packs, and arrived leaving an hour before the scheduled 8.30 departure time on Good Friday March 30, 2018. After locating the appropriate ticket counter (Counter 17), we were told that there were no tickets booked for us, the receipt number was incorrect and there were no available seats on that train or any train to Kandy on that or subsequent days. As there was a line of other customers behind us, we left the counter and went to the Railway Tourist Information Office next door. The office was not yet open but a helpful person told us that we could put our bags down inside and wait for someone to help us. We accepted the offer, respite from a crowded footpath and a seat in an air conditioned office. After making his morning offerings, a man named Sampath told us that he would inquire about the availability of tickets for us. He came back some time later with the information that there were no vacancies on the 8.30 train as it was a very busy holiday, but he would see if he could get us tickets on a later train. He made one or more phone calls and told us that it would be possible to get tickets for reserved seats on the 10.30 train. After much coming and going we he returned and revealed that the seats were available only as part of a package holiday involving accommodation and drivers/guides. As we had already booked accommodation in Kandy, he ""helpfully"" put together an itinerary based on our travel plans. We were a little surprised at the quoted costs but, as new arrivals in the country and feeling trapped in Colombo on one of the busiest travel days of the year, were in a good position to be exploited. We agreed to a much shortened and cheaper version of the 15 day package that was offered. The full package cost the equivalent of (Australian) $1 700 for 15 days. This exceeded our budget and did not match our desire to plan our travel as we discovered more about the country and what we wanted to do in it. The final deal was for 2 one way tickets to Kandy, 4 nights of accommodation in Sigiriya, and a driver/guide to drive us from Kandy to Sigiriya, to our destinations for the next 4 days and back to Kandy on the last day. While we waited for the process to play out and our tickets to be obtained we observed the same scam being used on a succession of European and Asian travellers by the other officials in the Information Office. The accommodation in Sigiriya was good but the driver, while seemingly friendly, offered very limited advice or details and at every opportunity tried to persuade us to go to costly tourist attractions and buy safari and village tours, which we declined. We have since discovered that the accommodation was owned by the ""tourist information officer"" and he has been using this as his main source of bookings for a long time. This scam is well known to many within the tourism sector in Sri Lanka and is not limited to Colombo Fort Station. The cost of both the accommodation and driver were inflated, so that the 76 000 rupee ($A 654) we paid was well in excess of what we would have paid by independently booking. Stick to information from the official government tourist offices which are located at the airport and in a number of cities throughout Sri Lanka. They do not receive commissions or kick backs, offer good advice to travellers, are very well informed and put together itineraries that match your interests and allow you to see everything possible in the budget and timelines available to you. They also book you excellent  drivers that (while not seemingly cheap) have great knowledge that they enthusiastically impart. We found the accommodation bookings they arranged for us to always exceed our expectations. the train from fort col to kandy at 10:00 am was the worst journey ever. at every halt jerk, (booked first class), no water Colombo Fort Railway Station is amazing. Busy, a frenzy of people going somewhere. Station masters in Colonial uniform which for anyone of a certain age can recognise from their childhood experiences when travelling by train was considered a journey. First impression could be described as chaotic but it works. The ticket counters are efficient and straight forward. The trains run on time obviously punctuality is highly regarded and the station master with his whistle is there to control things. The trains are something else and should be considered as part of the travel experience. Don't expect the Japanese Bullet train, AMTRAK or European services but great fun and something that you will be talking about in your postcards home. Even if you are not travelling anywhere Colombo Fort Railway Station is worth a visit just to absorb the atmosphere of locals travelling. The Sri Lankan railway has a website and claims that you can make on-line bookings but it doesn't work.  The station is filthy, crowded and the service is terrible. The trains too are filthy.  You have to go through these stations even to board the Expolanka Luxury trains. It's just not worth it. A few meters north of the Station the intercity Bus stand with air-conditioned buses await to take you to all cities in the country. The fare is only a fraction of the luxury train fare. For example the Luxury train is Rs. 1,500 to kandy where as the Air-conditioned bus costs only Rs 300. 3rd class train travel is the cheapest but don't even think of the 2nd class train compartments. Most aren't air conditioned and even the fans don't work. And the 2nd class fare is an absolute rip off for a mismanaged national railway system. Wonder what the half a dozen or so Ministers of Transport are upto The toilets are not to be recommended . Please try to do your business elsewhere before coming here . As a railway station its  much the same as most  stations .It would have some charm it an effort was made to preserve /highlight its colonial structures and put up some  interesting information  on its heritage. This was one of my more fun experiences of travelling by train. The Intercity colombo Jaffna bound train is very comfortable and the restaurant carriage is a nice place to hang out enjoying the passing view. Up to Vavuniya travel is a tad discomforting due to the train swaying but one can still overlook this and enjoy the passing view, The Train leaves on time at 5.45 am, so it is really a wonderful scenery one encounters of the mist just lazily rising up from the vast paddy fields. The restaurant does not serve much in variety so its better to bring ones food and drinks, which we did. After Vavuniya it is smooth going as its on new tracks. so go on  and enjoy the ride. I have used Colombo Fort Rail station twice and it has been fine.  I live in London so it might be that I am not intimidated by crowds rushing but using the ticket service and finding the correct platform and train seat was very simple.  Train travel is a very convenient and cheap way to travel through Sri Lanka.  We travelled in the very early morning commuter trains (we had small hand luggage bags) and it was a very pleasant experience even in second class.  We would happily do it again, infact we are planning to use trains for our next visit. We took a car from Colombo to Kandy for 800 Sri Lankan rupees and then on the return journey we took a train for back via Colombo to Hikkaduwe   which is far south of Colombo and paid 180 SL rupees for train tickets both of us. We were determined to ride the Sri Lankan railway from Colombo to Matara - we were able to book 2nd Class tickets about an hour before the train was due to leave but we still ended up standing for 21/2 hours of the 31/2 hours jouney. The station is old and in need of a facelift but has the typical character of colonial railway buildings - rivets everywhere in the roof structure. It is not possible to get on to the platforms unless you are travelling by train and so 'sightseeing' is not available - but to be honest  - not much to see!! This is the main and biggest railway station in Sri Lanka from where you can get trains to every part of the country. Unfortunately, it is always too crowded and not at all organized or regulated. For starters, you will have to enter in a room to get tickets for Ella/Nuwara Eliya and that small room is full of chaos. It's full of people pushing each other with no one to tell you what queue to join. People can be often seen cutting queues here and there is no official to keep track of it. When you go inside the station you will see it's too crowded. There is a small snack shop which charges more than the MRP. At least at the railway station I would have expected some kind of regulation (which is missing in the rest of Sri Lanka anyway). A 1.5 L water bottle was being sold for 80 LKR when the MRP mentioned was 70 LKR. I raised this with the man at the counter to which he gave some crazy explanation. Since you cannot go out of the station once you have entered (they take your ticket back on your way out), you don't have a choice but to buy water or other essentials from here if you forgot to buy them outside. There is a bridge to access different platforms on the station. However, the locals rarely follow the bridge. Most people go from above the train tracks even though it has been clearly mentioned not to do so. There is a very small waiting room which is almost always crowded. It's better to sit on the benches than in the waiting room. Try to book tickets in advance and come to the station only 15 minutes prior to the departure of your train. The main railway station of the country, Fort Railway station is located close to the Pettah bus station (300metres) and connects well to every nook and corner of the country. The Fort station has a good Cloak (luggage) room service to store your luggage inside a huge box with a lock and key. Using the luggage room costs LKR 57 per day. It is quite cheap in case you wish to visit the city and not carry unnecessary luggage. The station is clean in general and well maintained. The trains need to improve as they all look quite old. You can sneak in and out without a ticket from the back side entrance. In case you book an Expo online ticket, make sure to go to the ticket reservation room and exchange that for an actual ticket printout. You need a train or platform ticket to enter the station. You will need to be early for the unreserved trains. It gets quite crowded and you will fight to get a seat. The third class coaches have an ""E"" on it and second class coaches have a ""2"" painted on them. Toilets are really bad and might make you vomit. Use the Foreign passengers toilet if it is available, it is available at the Kandy train station. Overall, a very crowded place. I was sceptic about my intention to travel by train from Colombo to Kandy and how to purchase my ticket - at the end I am glad I managed I took a tuk tuk to the Colombo Fort Railway station and was taken to the sales office at the end of the building where the clerk spoke good English and I got my ticket for the next day for not quite SLR 300 (1,5€) in a 2nd class reserved seat the station itself is a left over from Colonial times and has an old world charm, a big board just as you enter through the main entrance shows you where you will find your train ...I was lucky not to have to change platform, might be difficult with suitcase if you can't find your way just ask...plenty of polite railway personel around I arrived 30 minutes before departure and it was easy, shortly before departure time the place was crowded and the journey itself was great...2 1/2 hrs ....scenic Sri Lankan views If you are into people watching, Fort Railway Station is the place! Always busy, always teeming with travellers and an assortment of vendors, bearers, taxi drivers and con men, all hoping to make a dime from you and me. But if you happen to be one of the travellers yourself, the place can be a trying experience. Written information is erratic, and chances are that you wait in line for what seems ages only to find that you have been in the wrong queue. The only reason to visit us if you are arriving or leaving by train. It is old and very congested. Outside you are approached by many TukTuk drivers offering to drive you. Travelling by train in Sri Lanka is an experience in itself. If you can survive getting around the chaos of the railway station. You will usually find some one to help, usually a local not the staff. We ere travelling from Colombo towards Galle. The tourist Services office staff are very helpful and friendly for all train info. Train travel is slightly crazy but really cheap, good way of seeing the country. Try a short eat from the station restaurant on platform 1 - tasty! The toilets are the station are horrible - make sure you have a tissue in your pocket! A great station to enter or leave Colombo. Information regarding trains in three languages on an electronic billboard. Several kiosks there low cost tickets can be bought Hectic & busy you can’t help but get caught up in the buzz of this station. The staff are friendly & helpful & will direct you to where you need to go. You exit the station into more madness but turn left & there is a market area that is worth a look. Be careful pickpockets operating through the station.  We got robbed. There is a possibility that officials are helping with it. Crowds do not help with the situation. This is a public place and always busy station. Please note this is the starting station for any destination. This is an excellent place where you can see the traditional train and modern train services. This is the central station and always crowded. Good to visit and see the way how Sri Lanka maintain/adopt the British style without major changes. Colombo Fort Station is in the centre of the city and was opened in 1917, it is chaotic and always busy with a constant flow of intercity and commuter trains arriving and departing. I arrived into the station from Kandy by Intercity and then easily purchased a ticket from the ticket booth for a commuter train journey to Katunayake south station. I liked the buzz of the station and enjoyed passing through it, Interesting relic of old times with far too many passengers.  Helpful staff.  Booking tickets can be difficult. What a fiasco. Make sure to have small bills (money) . They seldom have change for bigger denominations. Always ask a train attendant where the train is coming from.... Or departing from to eliminate confusion. Keep your ticket! Will need it when exiting station. If you are planning on taking a tuk Tuk when you arrive...  Do NOT take one from the front of the station.  They do not have fare meters and their prices are sky high. Just walk 50 feet or so to the main road and hail a taxi from there.  99% of the tuk Tuk 's in Colombo has fare meters.  The other 1% is at the railway station. Lol. The toilets are extremely dirty. So try and hold it in. Starting with the ticket counter, they do not smile or talk plesantly with the traveler.Terible platform floor with uneven tiles. Place is litered with garbage. Maybe a few garbage bins will help. We were here twice, while we took a train to Galle ( we missed it) and another when we got down on our way back from Jaffna. The platforms are clean enough but there is always a definite crowd, which is obvious since it's the capital city and used by locals and tourists alike. Ticket counters are easy to spot and people are helpful enough with information. We were planning to travel to hikkaduwa from the colombo fort railway station. The first problem was finding the right ticket counter out of the many. There is an information service counter where you can get help. They are friendly and accommodating. Standing for 2 hours in a crowded train didn't seem to make sense, so we got down. The ticket counter guy was nice enough to refund our train ticket fare. We took a bus instead which was much more comfortable and we got seats too. For a long distance i would suggest bus. This is a historical station which does not appear to have been renovated since being built. My experience of it may be coloured by the fact I was using it over the New Year weekend and maybe counters that were closed would normally be open. I got more information from a dapper man who saw me looking lost and came up to volunteer information about the trains (although I really suspect he was looking for a tip or for me to decide to take his taxi instead) I wanted to take a trip to Mount Lavinia on the Galle line for the experience and, although I managed on the day that I travelled to buy a 2nd class ticket on the 8.35 train, no matter what counter I went to could anyone tell me the times of returning trains. It was only when I arrived in Mount Lavinia that I could establish there was a return train in 5 minutes or I needed to wait four hours. The actual train ride consisted of standing absolutely squashed and unseeing in the vestibule (but fun talking to fellow passengers, some of whom had suitcases and didn't comprehend they would be standing for 2 hours to Galle) . I might as well have bought a third class ticket - not that either was very expensive which explains why there is no spare money to do up the station. I ended up catching the third class only (15 rupees instead of 20) return train at 9.05 which had plenty of unoccupied seats and pleasant fellow passengers and I was back at Fort before 9.30 keep your bags with you , smile and carry on . tickets can be purchased for all over sri lanka from here . ticket windows are numbered . lots of tuk tuk drivers and people around just keep your wits about you ....... good cheap food in stalls near by We took the train from Colombo to Kandy with all of our luggage. Go to booth 17 and book for the first class to make it easy - a whole £5 each for an approx 3 hour journey. The seats reclined and moved apart from the one next to them to give more space. Very helpful chaps serving mugs of tea and pastries. With free wi-fi and a film! our train didn't have the observation car sadly. There are separate toilets on the platform for ""foreigners"", but the loo on the train was fine. I didn't see anyone on the roof of any trains, but plenty hanging out of open doors! If you can remember diesel trains being shunted up the line to change direction, this station will bring back memories. Pettah market is opposite, and there's a clothing market next door. Fantastic trip through Pettah Market to find this if you want a true local experience and enjoy mixing with the average guy in the street this is a must ...We were allowed to go in and photograph the elderly trains and old pictures from the Ceylon days when the railway was first starting up ... a great way to see the real life ... afterwards we walked the streets of a local shanty town .... nobody bothered of harassed us we did not feel anything but welcomed by the locals best day of all in Colombo Very busy place in center of colombo ..morning & evening office time are very busy ..price very cheap Colombo Fort Staion is right out of the history books .. There are a lot of ticket counters and finding the one you need can be quite hard( there is a tourist info office outside though)  there are steep steps to manage between platforms and it can be quite manic at times.. Started train services in Sri Lanka by the British in 1864 to transport coffee from Kandy to Colombo to be shipped to European countries. At present Fort station has become one of the main transport hubs for public and freight transports. Trains to all directions start from Fort station and bookings can be done before hand from the station or online. Who ever is interested in British architecture and to see a bit of local culture could visit Fort station as it is situated in the hart of Colombo. If you are planning to see the countries scenic beauty you should start the journey from Fort Railway station. Some of the services available are waiting rooms, changing rooms (utility rooms), cafeterias, special arrangements for disabled persons, etc........ I went early in the morning to go to the finish line. She was alone, anxious in the early morning when it was still dark. A man approached us and told us that he wanted to buy a ticket to the finish line. When I felt like I should stay away from him, he opened the zipper on my body bag. My wallet, which was jabbered, I couldn't slurp, but it was a hiccup because I also had my passport in it. We were giving out free milk tea on the station platform, but when I asked if it was free, they said how much. When I didn't get it, a woman nearby told me to drink it because it was free and it was delicious. Urban stations require caution. A photo was also taken of Japanese people, perhaps because they are rare. It's been a lot, but it's been a good experience. This is the main railway station in Sri Lanka connecting all the major cities by rail in the Island. The place is mostly crowded during the peak time. quite an old place of nice architecture. If you are to travel by train this is the best place to catch your train which is the most cheapest form of transport. From here you can go across the sri lanka cheaply but please avoid the washrooms and the floor is cleaner than all most every other thing here. Bring your own food and other stuff and take care of your belongings and late trains. In desperate need for an upgrade. If you need to get a ticket of long out station journeys you need to look for the door at the far end (pettah end) of the front of the station. Very busy place and largest railway station in Sri Lanka with more than 10 platforms. Services are middle range. We bought a ticket to travel from Colombo to Kandy. We got into the wrong train SLOW is not Enough word to describe the tour but was so funny. The train took 5 hours even if no one of the other passengers next to us knew how long more was the trip or the arrival time in Kandy City. Took the train from Mount Lavinia to here which was an experience in itself, people were hanging out of the open doors, the seats had holes in them.....literally. On getting off the train at Colombo Fort I was struck by the dirt and what felt like general lack of maintenance. We want to book tickets to Kandy but the tuktuk dropped us in front on the tourist information center (not official one btw) and a man guided us to the center. They offer expensive tours that can actually be done by half of the offered price in better hotels not even guest houses. They can be convincing as they relay on many tourist travel unprepared. So be aware of these kind of actions since you will face them in almost every city in Sri Lanka. You will end up here if you take a train in or out of Colombo. Transportation is plentiful outside the station, by either Taxi or TukTuk. It is worth a peak inside, if you are not traveling, there are public restrooms as well. It is close to Pettah Market. You have to go through a jungle of people and get pushed around alot. Not convinient as they do not have a proper online booking system which would make it MUCH easier to book tickets. Should be prepared and buy tickets early. The people there help you out and the people behind the counter have been very helpful. Very dirty station, could use a repaint and the restrooms need ALOT I mean ALOT more cleaning and painting and facilities for a station where 1000 of people travel everyday! Come on.... When we arrived at Sri Lanka we didn't really have a plan until we went to Colombo Fort Railway Station. At this time we decided on one thing and that was to go to Kandy by train. On arriving at the station we was pointed to the Tourist Information Centre for help obtaining our ticket. We met Prasanna who was a very good help because the train we wanted to catch was full but got us sorted on the next train in comfortable seats with air con. At this point he started talking about booking a tour through him ""we thought here we go"" After a lengthy chat and giving us some figures ""which sounded a very good deal"" we decided to book and I'm glad we did. We would have never been able to see as much of Sri Lanka so easily without this tour. It was arranged for our driver to pick us up from our hotel in Kandy and that he did. This is when we met Lahiru Dissanayaka our driver and tour companion for 5 days. Lahiru was an absolute godsend and became a very good friend over them 5 days. We saw everything possible in the time we had and Lahiru's knowledge of the places we visited was exceptional. We saw everything we could from our Kandy City tour on our first day. Kandy to Nuwara Eliya on our second day. Nuwara Eliya to Matale, Dambulla and Sigiriya on our third. A jeep Safari at Polonnaruwa ""we saw so many elephants, it was a beautiful sight"" and all the ancient ruins on our fourth. On our fifth day Lahiru took us from Sigiriya to the drop off point of our choice which was a long trek to Trincomalee seeing and stopping at some beautiful sights on our way. It was sad to see Lahiru go and I would highly recommend Rail Tours to see all the beautiful sights of Sri Lanka at a very good price. Just take your time when your in the office and point out what you want to see and when and you won't be disappointed. A big thank you to Rail Tours and a bigger thank you to Lahiru Dissanayaka. This station was staffed by friendly helpful people but was very chaotic and confusing, The toilets were the worst I that I saw during my 5 weeks in Sri Lanka, they do have tourist toilets but they were locked and they could not find the key holder! A couple of booths selling snacks and drinks but nothing else, so grab drinks and snacks or fruit from the shops outside the station. We were about to get our tickets to Galle and the tourist information office just wanted to sell their tours. They do offer. Great customer service but sometimes it’s better to do your own consultation before believing on what they say. Still this place should be more improved. especially wash rooms. some time back they were collecting money from the users of wash rooms and there was no any significant improvement. It is just like a Railway Station like Mumbai's CST Raillway.  But certainly not that great archiitrctural value.  The surroundings are just like any of the moderately big Railway Stations in India, surrounded with shops, eateries etc. We got an Uber from Negombo to Colombo fort station in the rush hour which took  1 hour and 20 minutes. We arrived at 9am and there was no queue for second class ticket at no. 3 counter. The ticket inspector told us which platform to go to. When the train arrived we knew 2nd class was at the front but the train didn’t come right to end of platform, so we had to walk further up to get in. On previous trip advisor advice we took the first seats we found and had a good journey. A few people who arrived later had to stand so the train was full but not overcrowded Colombo Fort is not a world class Station by any stretch of the imagination, but it's nowhere near the worst either. I had pre booked tickets (prior to leaving Australia) and went to Colombo Fort the day before travelling to collect the tickets. The Station is quite easy to navigate, and they even have an office for Tourist Info. They seemed recently renewed the luggage storage. There are no wooden lockers anymore but are morgue-like steel lockers with keys. They said they close at 7:30 pm. Also, be aware of the scam. A deaf guy kindly helps you at the station and demand tips of more than 1000Rs when you have a seat on a train. テロの影響でサービスを停止していたらしい、ロッカーは復活していました。遺体安置所みたいな鉄製のロッカーで、鍵は備え付けです。聾唖者のガイドに要注意。車両に乗り込んできて寄付金を募ってきます（しかも相場が1000Rs）。まあ大した金額では無いし、駅の作りや乗り方も初見ではわかりにくいので、聞き倒すのもありかもしれません。 We were only here for about 20 minutes before our train to Kandy. Found it easy enough to buy a ticket at one of the counters for second class (someone had recommended ticket counter 17 but we just went to the first one at it was fine). Inside I used the toilet before heading on the train as I wasn't sure there would be one on it. There was a 'ladies waiting room' area and it had toilets inside. Pretty horrible toilets but it was a toilet - I've been to worse! The train station was pretty busy but the staff helped direct us to the right train. Our train departed about 10 minutes late which was fine. The journey from Colombo to Kandy is beautiful and took about 3.5 hours. We were on a blue train (I'm sure they have a name but I don't know it!) in second class and it was pretty comfy and not as busy as I thought. The train board outside said all trains were FULL, so we thought it was going to be manic! But there were loads of empty seats on our carriage. Oh, and the blue trains do have a toilet if anyone is worried about a long journey or going with children. Such a busy station, good to people watch!  Would recommend using the bathrooms if you don't desperately need to go.  If you need a tuk tuk beware of the drivers as you exit.  They will refuse to use meters and will overcharge.  Make sure you barter and do not accept their first price.  We asked away from many.  We were given 600-1000 rupees in price to our hotel, ended up paying 300. What can I say about Colombo’s Fort Railway station other then, if you have only been to a train station in a developed country then you are in for a shock!  The way to enjoy it is to just go with the flow.  The station itself is easy to find and all tuk-tuk drivers know where it is. The station has many ticket counters, all numbered, and above which is a list of places they stop and the cost.  If in doubt go to counters 6 or 7 which are the inquiry counters where you can get help.  We travelled on the Sri Lankan trains to Hikkaduwa, Galle, Kandy and Negombo and had no problems at all finding the train times and getting the correct trains.  500 or 1000 LKR notes are best for the ticket counters as the train prices are very cheap in Sri Lanka.  Once you have your ticket go through the entrance and there is a large screen which will tell you the platform number, it changes between Sri Lanka and English every 30 seconds or so. When on the correct platform you can ask a member of staff which end of the platform the carriages for 2nd or 3rd class will arrive.  Once the train starts to appears pick you bags up and get ready for the rush to the door.  There will not be any manners shown, so it will be every man, woman and child for yourself. (No different to ‘rush’ hour at any station in the world).  Keep your ticket as you will need to hand it in when you get off the train. The trains are heavily used in Sri Lanka so if you are slow getting on you may not have a seat.  If so, and you don’t mind standing, you can stand by the open carriage doors which is a great way to see the country side pass by. We didn’t use the website instead just went to the station to book the tickets. PS. Try to get an ‘express’ train rather than a ‘slow’ train as they are slow. Going thru the train station was an easy and pleasant experience. Arrived well in advance finding the platform was a non issue and mixing in the morning life a real delight. Catching the train was also easy and helped by locals if needed be. The place is a paradise for photographers catching local life in morning light. The Station is clean and connects to all parts of Sri Lanka where trains travel. Reservations can be made on Main lines at the reservations Counter ( Counter No 17). Better to decide prior to your journey and reserve your seats in advance at least 25 to 30 days ahead as Train Journeys are very popular and gets fully booked in no time. If you are travelling to Kandy, take the second class carriage. You will get a seat, you can open the windows and an overall very enjoyable experience for seeing the sights and taking photos. I had read reviews before going to the train station and they seemed very mixed of good and bad experiences. We got to the train station with about 40 mins to spare for our train at 10.30 from Colombo to Galle. It was easy to get a ticket and cost us each 180 for second class tickets. The guy at the platform told us which platform to go to as our train hadn’t even appeared on the board. Once on the train it was very busy and we ended up standing for the first hour but luckily people got off at different stations and we got a seat eventually. The train ride is about 2 and a bit hours, it’s not that comfortable and the toilet is basically a hole that goes straight on the tracks which we found to be an experience in its self 😂. Once at Galle, it is good to look when the trains are back the next day. It’s not a trip you can do in a day as the last train back seems to be around 3/4pm. Many people try to help you saying they work at the station but usually they do help but then have another agenda e.g. then try get you to take a taxi with them. On our way back to Colombo we ended up getting the bus back as we would have had to wait 2 hours for the train and we both we’re not looking forward to the journey again. Some men tried to get us to get in a taxi for 5000 which seemed cheap but in comparison to the train ticket it is not. In the end we just went to the bus station to ask and found a bus straight away the price was 340 each to get to Colombo which we took as we were confirmed seats, air con and was definitely a more comfort drive. We asked if we could get dropped off earlier then Colombo as we would have driven past our accommodation and it was fine to do that. It may take an hour longer to get to each destination but definitely more comfortable and I would recommend looking at getting the bus both ways. This is the Oldest Railway station in Sri Lanka. Initiated in 1864, sandwiched between two roads namely Henry Steel Olcott Mawatha and  MacCallum Road. A small peninsula in the Beira Lake. Very old Victorian architecture is visible but with very poor or no maintenance. Recent developments to the Railway platforms are encouraging. Communication system is very hash, blurred and unclear. Smelly toilets and unfriendly staff. Ticket counter clerks are caged in like monkeys and throw the tickets and change to the travelers. Not customer friendly or Oriented. Very poorly maintained. Rail tracks are full of used tickets,paper.empty PVC bottles etc, Cleaning had not being done for years.Very old photographs are sited in wrong places, difficult to enjoy them as crowds gather there to exit. Improper or no layout plans is playing a big role here. This Railways Station is the main Fort Railway In Colombo to take different part of the city to travel a small Tourist information office available, need more computerize system to be update specially for tourist. its not well maintain. need more care an attention. Very old style rail station. Does the job but if the waiting time is more then it is real pain. It is clean though and you get drinking water bottles and some snacks. There was a oldish restaurant but we did not check it out. This is the main Railway station in the capital Colombo.You can catch a train to any part of the Island.Srilanka has many good train routes.Like any major railway station this station is also surrounded by many food outlets. An easy train experience compared to some other places in the region. Just be careful when trains arrive of course, as people can get very pushy coming off and on. Just wait back when the train arrives, it's not worth it to push and shove for a seat. There is always room to stand, and nobody will push or shove you if you are ok with sitting on the floor, or next to the door (best views). since 18 th century. british people build colonial style station. for any destination to start trainne journes start from this place. 24 hrs open. affter enter this place not very clean and maintaining.specialy monday to friday morning 7am to 9am &  evening 4 pm to 7pm sooooo busy....... The station is hectic but no where near as India. Ground staff are most helpful helping us with our luggage into the cabin and locating our seat. Ticket office needs improvement to reduce waiting times, would be great to buy tickets online; maybe there is a way but we couldn’t give a way We came here to catch a train to kandy. Got our prepaid tickets validated and left our packs in the left luggage for 300 rupees (byo lock- we borrowed one from the man) while we walked around town. Was fine and easy to catch train. Toilets skankin.  (Awful) Travelling to the North and Upcountry is more comfortable when you travel in an Air conditioned first class compartment. These carriages have adjustable seats which can also be rotated to face the direction of travel, or to face each other when travelling as a group, with adequate leg space. The 5.45am train to jaffna is a fully air conditioned one. All three trains heading to Badulla via Kandy on the upcountry line, have one air-conditioned compartnent. Special weekend trains to Kandy and back are also fully air conditioned. Recently I traveled to Badulla with my family as we wanted to  see the hill country Through Observation car windows. The journey was nearly 12 hours. Will you believe if I say there is no place for  a meal in this train. Early days there was a canteen called Buffet. Now it is not there. The train stops at Nawalapitya and in that station there is a canteen. I bought a Mango Nectar bottle and tasted horrible. No need to talk about their food.The fans in the observation car some were not working. unfortunately we were under one of them. The toilet was terrible. I had to was the toilet for my family members. I felt shame as there were some foreigners in the compartment. Can not understand why nobody wants to improve the conditions. It is better if the ticket issuers inform the commuters when they are booking the seats that the facilities they get when they travel. Then they could bring a meal packet. Water and drinks from home. I purchased tickets both ways and The Guard who was in the Colombo Badulla was really nice and helpful. He was acting like a tour guide. Hub for all long distance trains.  Was very busy, asked at tourist information about the train we wanted and were told it was full and to get a later train.  We asked the ticket seller, got tickets, got on, got seats and had a very nice trip to Rambukana.  Don't believe tourist information. Counter 17 for reservations. Even if they tell you a train is fully booked, go there at 5 am when the office opens and, unless you are a he group - you will surely get a seat on the train to Ella. Tuk tsk drivers outside the station are among the most dishonest in Sri Lanka so be careful and perhaps get the metered ones. Really busy environment. Staff generally unhelpful. Trains dirty and noisy - what more can I say? There are foreigners toilets - which you can get a key for - the locals facilities are shocking...Take care which train you get on - staff will put you on the wrong train...I think its a game they play! Quaint, clean, no rush and transport easily available at the gates. So convenient for travellers coming in. Trains coming in at the correct time and leaving at the correct time. Good for commuters. the only place to get in to the train in colombo. At fort if you want to use the toilet this is one of the place you will get a releafe. Pay a ticket for the platform and then you can use the toilet. The station area is clean, inside and in front, that is very good comparing to stations I have been to f.ex. in India. I also felt safe during my time waiting for the train to Jaffna. Still I was glad that I didn`t need to use the bathroom or had to eat in a restaurant. Reading reviews here, it is easy to see that some people have experienced various scams. The place is chaotic and it is not clear which queue you should be standing in. My wife and I stood at different windows, in order to get our tickets. She found out that she had been sent  to the wrong one and so signalled me to stay put. We finally got our tickets and enjoyed an exciting train ride to Polonnaruwa. Taking the train is a great way to experience the country, but can be uncomfortable and stressful. This stage of our journey was fine. Last month (October) we took a train from here at 8.30a.m. to Kandy.  Platform was so easy to locate & there was a gentleman who showed us where to wait & then when the train arrived, he showed us where to get on & find out seats.  Very easy experience compared to stations in India. Please read the reviews! Tourists Information Centre is a scam! My friend and I booked first class tickets and only to realize the day of our trip that we got third class tickets but PAID for first class! Once we arrived in Hatton, our driver kept rushing us to go home yet we paid for him for 4 days. He didn't work on the first two days (just a drive to the hotel on day one and to and from Adam's Peak on day two). Day three he kept using his phone and then he ran out of the vehicle with his phone and hid behind a rock wall so we wouldn't see him on the phone...we don't speak the language so no need to hide. Both of us felt VERY unsafe with him so we decided not to go with him to Kandy...instead we booked a real first class train ticket. USP Lanka Tours and Travels was the receipt we got from the Colombo Fort Railway Station: Tourists Information Centre (left side of the building). Please book with hotels as they are cheaper and honest! That is what we have learned from out trip....This company is nothing but a scam! TCR is Third Class Reservation and AFC is A/C First Class Reservation. Look at your ticket immediately! You need to book in advance for first or second class to guarantee a seat otherwise queue on the day two hours prior for third class with no chance of a seat This is an iconic landmark in the city of Colombo. It is situated in the heart of the business district of Colombo. Most of the trains from other places of Sri Lanka halt here. The station as such is of old colonial style and it has not been remodeled. There are not many platforms and the ticket counters are also few. The entrance is impressive colonial style. Next to the station are a lot of shopping, but don't expect genuine stuff and also the locals don't seem very interested in selling their goods. because they don't expect you to bargain, even though the stuff is fake. The station is very dirty and not at all maintained well. The less said of the trains and the compartments. The infrastructure has seen better days but the service was generally good. Tannoy messages were not always as clear as they could have been Prasanna organised a tour around Sri Lanka with the best driver ever.  Professional, knowledgeable  about political and cultural situation.  We are delighted we found them.  First experience with a driver for us and it made our stay so very enjoyable.  We saw much more of Sri Lanka than we expected to see in the time we spent there.  Highly recommend this service. PS we left a charger behind in one hotel and rail tours organised the return for us! A typical Indian railway station. For Europens must  visit it to understand the local life style. Very crowded. Just to let you know that if you go south even if you ticket says the train departs from Maradhana, you don't have to go this place. Colombo fort is the second stop so if you take the train at Maradhana Station you'll end up back at Fort in 5/10 mins. Normally is platform 6, blue and white train, be aware that if you buy 3rd class you'll be crammed inside or even hanging outside the door. For first class tickets is another wagon. Be ready. Nothin special compared to other asian train stations but worth seeing it if you haven't seen another one. The timetables are not electronic but wooden!! Restrooms are seperate for men and women and foreigners. In general it is asian and  colonialistic and exotic without beeing chaotic like some other railway station in this region. You need a ticket to enter the station and see the platforms this is the railway station after mount lavinia if you are planning to explore the island nation by train. I visited this station since I was travelling to Jaffna by train and boarded my train from this station. as compared to Indian stations these are still backdated. there is no proper announcement system, there are no LCD/ LED indicators indicating which train is arriving when and which platform, the rake positions etc. But it will add up in due course of time I hope. the station exteriors are not that clean as is the rest of the city. The Colombo Fort Railway Station is the main point of departure for trains to all points of the country such as  Kandy, Nuwara Eliya and Jaffna. Lovely old building which needs TLC. We visited the wooden Tourist Enquiries area where we were given vague information in response to our specific questions. The man became a lot more animated and effective when a couple of 20 something young ladies turned up and it became clear he had put together a private tour for them. There is a government/private JV in relation to this office and we had much better service and replies to our questions at the General Enquiries counter (11) run by the Railway itself . There is a dedicated area (17) to book first class sleeper and observation cars which is split into separate counters for different routes. First class is cheap and the only way to travel by train..! The 3 wheelers immediately outside the station are largely rip off merchants so best to get one dropping people or walk to the main road and make sure you get one with a meter. This place is the hub of travel from Colombo. At certain times of day it is ok, but not during the rush hours when you will be jostled and squeezed. No lifts of course, so cross the tracks to change platforms. Very old-fashioned. Not well signed. A good place to escape from. Very neat and clean Railway system.The trains are very good and the station is basic but with very friendly and helpful locals Located in a busy place. Unfortunately the day i was supposed to go to Galla by train, there was a protest near the railway station leading to terrible traffic. Worst experience in my travel log. Missed the train journey too :( Train station with lots of movement. initially seems to be very confusing, but the staff give good information, if we are lost with so many counters to buy tickets. The station is also located near the bus station and has commerce around. This is Sri Lanka's largest railway station, situated as it is, in the heart of the island's commercial district in Colombo. It was built during the colonial era of the mid 19th century, and reminds one of the Victoria Station in London. But the resemblance is fleeting. The station is dirty and drab, and desperately needs a facelift. A continuous maintenance crew is necessary to ensure the cleanliness and functioning of its facilities as it serves a constant stream of office workers and holiday makers throughout the year. No self respecting individual would dare use its waiting rooms or washrooms, the ticket collectors and other officials are indifferent or rude, and rarely does a train arrive or depart on time. Such a pity. So much potential. It is sad when an old building goes to rack and ruin. This is a historic place and daily use hundreds thousand of commuters. There are lots of facilities have to to be improved including rest rooms, waiting area, and toilets. Organising a ticket from outside Sri Lanka ie booking online would have been great but not possible from Australia so fortunately Reddot kindly helped us book ahead  but even then we'd hoped for a sleeper but got the seats . We've caught trains , tuk tuks and buses in various Asian countries but what struck me was the station was like entering a mine and I was ready to send my canary in first ! .. poor poor lighting so I was happy to notice a women's waiting room as I'd be a little cautious  if a lone female traveller  due to the darkness although of course as we found throughout Sri Lanka people are very friendly . locating the right train was a little challenging and although very old trains they were clean with clean toilets . The train stops here. And there for mail pick up/ drop off  and at one pint stopped 20 minutes where the local vendors wait for train travellers to sell there food. The hot drink vendor calls along the train "" teacoffeeteacoffeeteacoffee"" . Bottled water also available from vendor . If you're only going to Polonnarawu you'll need to book a night at a close hotel as the train arrives around 1:30 am so don't anticipate too much sleep on the night train but it's an easy way to get to visit the Cultural Triangle and beyond ... Just make sure you can find your train in the dark . This being the most common 'first Sri Lankan railway experience' for most travellers, the staff are quite helpful in where to send you for tickets/reservations. The locals are also willing to help you out if you are looking lost! The signage is easy to come across and with Pettah Markets just across the road you can get some cheap food and shopping before you head off. Dead easy to get your tickets and travel. Found our way to Galle en route to Unawatuna. £1 each and a great experience. Don’t get a taxi take the train!, If you don’t have train tickets I’d recommend you purchase tickets as soon as you arrive in Sri Lanka. You can purchase tickets for train travel in the future. The ticket lines can be a bit chaotic but hold your place in line. Ignore ALL advice that trains are fully booked in advance. Go to the counter which states ""All Tickets"" and buy a ticket on the day for the journey you want. They are unlikely to be full, but could be busy (Colombo to Habarana isn't). Second class is fine. Check in seat61.com for more on timings. The Tourist Office next door was misleading (and pretty dishonest). AVOID IT! My husband and I thought we would try something different and take a train from Colombo to Kandy for an overnight stay. We read all the do's and don'ts of riding on the train and thought we were well prepared. WRONG!!! No amount of preparation could ever prepare a person for the sheer madness and chaos of this place! We arrived a good hour before boarding time and tried to get 1st class tickets but they were sold out. No big deal so we got 2nd class. Stood waiting for the train and the moment those doors opened it was nothing but pushing & shoving with people trying to get on to grab a seat. I lost my husband in all the chaos but found him and thankfully he secured 2 seats for us...or so I thought! A guy who I guess was in charge of crowd control & placement stood in front of my seat not letting me sit down next to my husband and kept pointing to the next car. Then a young 20ish yr old girl boards and he puts her in my seat! My husband & I argued that no she wasn't sitting there but he completely ignored us. He then called to security and the security told the girl to stay!!!! Not too sure, but we suspect she might have bribed them to give her a seat. My husband was so upset as was the gentleman behind us who witnessed the entire thing,both began telling the girl off but no way would she move. My husband told me to come and sit by the window and he sat in the middle between the girl and I on 2 seats. It was a very long and uncomfortable & crowded ride. Too many people crammed into a very small space. I don't know how an elderly person or someone with a physical disability could travel this way and if they do then bless them!! The Fort Railway station is the central train station in Colombo with direct services to the main provincial towns such as Kandy, Jaffna and Nuwara Eliya. The station is near the Pettah which is a busy and bustling market place, well worth exploring. The station itself has seen better days and could do with some TLC. I frequently visit here to pick friends and to travel. Although outside of the station is a bit awkward inside is quite clean and you will only be disturbed by the announcements from time to time. I even used to read books and do stuff on my laptop seated on the 9th & 10th platforms when trains were late. You need to buy a platform ticket for Rs.10/- to enter the railway station to pick someone or even to say goodbye. There's a bookshop inside the station where you will find things with info on Sri Lanka. The setback of the premises is huge and nice. They have maintained it in a superb way keeping flower pots and stuff. The station itself is very very basic. However this post is in relation for tourists using the 'tourist information' which is not just for information but booking travel. We used this for our travels around Sri Lanka, as had a lot of distance to cover in not that much time (2 weeks). Now we may have been slightly done of the price (70 pounds per person for 5). But our trip included and a/c van and driver for Colombo to hikkaduwa then to aruganbay, ella and then to kandy. We also had an OBSERVATION carriage booked for the beautiful train ride from Ella to Nanuoya as well. All dealt through Prasanna Ferdinando (tour assistant) we were happy for the majority of the package. However, he tried to screw us for a little extra. Firstly, lying about the exchange rate (he called the bank to to prove he was right and shown to be completely and utterly wrong). This was to gain that little extra from us which he gave up on as he said we had given the him a 'headache' (all very embarrassing and rude). Secondly, instead of buying the tickets for the observation carriage for the later part of the trip in Ella (1000 rupees each ticket), he got us the 3rd class tickets (400 rupees each or less). Finding this out a couple of days before, a stern call to Prasanna meant out driver bought the tickets and gave them to us when he returned to pick out bags us at Ella while we got the train. That said our driver was a legend and a good laugh. This made up for poor experience with Prasanna. Very poor experience if you want to experience jumps opt for this .... I booked observation class and too hot .... Must say they should learn to modify their train facility .. Not recommend for pregnant ladies not safe very poor I will say worst service. We took the train towards Anuradhapura from here. You can book 2nd class only there will be no airco The main station I regularly commute. Station is pretty okay. There are some vendors,cafeteria and men's and women's. But the smells from the washrooms can not be bearable everyday. The Colombo fort railway station functions in a very old not so big colonial structure.  The premises was crowded all the time.  Outside is the roadside bus terminus from where buses can be had to different part of Colombo city. An important junction for both trains and buses in Colombo. Usual mad station. Well organised for getting the train and plenty of tuk tuks outside. The best thing for me was the Olcott statute outside which is obviously still revered. You need to take a train to NANU OYA which is the station closest to the Hill Station of Nuwara Eliya.  The ride is the most scenic you will probably experience in this part of the world, with mountains, waterfalls, and lots and lots of greenery.  It really is a wonderful train ride, on a not so comfortable train, but if you can get tickets on the Tourist Scenic Car with it's relatively large windows, you will really, really enjoy it.  By the way, trains in Sri Lanka cost next to nothing!!! On the first day of our trip, we went to the Colombo Fort Railway's tourist information office. The manager Prassana helped us with scheduling our itinerary and providing a private driver for the whole trip (7 days). Lahiru was our driver's name and we couldn't imagine having another driver than him. He took his time to stop at every interesting places and explain a lot of things concerning the Sri Lankan culture. He provided all the help we needed during our vacation across Sri Lanka. I highly recommend Prassana's tour and ask for Lahiru if possible! Except the colonial architecture , the place is very badly maintained. I guess this is a problem with Sri Lankan transportation system in general. They could have done a lot with this place as a tourist destination if it was properly maintained. Had a cold beer here most nights while in Tangalle. Nice and cold and cheap. First night I had the fresh fish. which was Barracuda, and mine was great. My partner had the Deviled Squid which she wasn't keen on. We had them give us a special Sri Lankan chicken curry the next night, which to be honest, wasn't that good. Lovely people and certainly worth a beer and a feed. Went to Colombo for a price giving function it was late when we arrived there so I planned to change my dress In waiting room The room is nice but the washroom is very bad so I didn’t used that and some place there is untidy The station itself is clean but be careful of the touts who are not all that innocent! The area is surrounded by dodgy looking shops and the worst Tuk Tuk drivers in the world! (Sri Lankan Tuk Tuk drivers are a bad name for Sri Lankan's all over the world!) Train journeys to Kandy / Galle etc are cheaper than taxis and the first class journeys are 'ok'! But they are very very bumpy! The trains however leave on time and are safe. Make sure to visit Booth number 7 before buying any tickets! The rail station gives off the aura of the old colonial period with old facilities and old trains. Cool place to have a look about! Despite the overwhelming first impression, it's easy to get to grips with this place. Yes it's busy, noisy and hot, nothing to make you feel unsafe though. Helpful railway tourist office gave us clear and helpful information and advice on the trains to Galle. Finding which platform was quite straight forward, always a helpful person to point you in the right direction, they always make me suspicious thinking they want something in return, they don't and are just being helpful (and making me feel guilty afterwards for thinking everyone is trying to rip us off). The interior of the station is quite grey and drab. Very noisy with trains coming and going as you would expect. The journey to Galle was great though. We got the first class tourist train. Was t much first class about it though other than aircon (that didn't work) and am assigned seat. No food or drinks on the train so be aware and come prepared. The journey was great though and the fact the aircon wasn't working was actually good as meant we could open the windows and get a much better view of the lovely costal scenery. Really recommend the Journey and a trip by train if you are in Colombo and want to get out of town. Local markets and stations show the real nature of local culture. Without exorbitant entrance fee ;-)) Just sitting there, watching the hustle and wustle and the small vendors while waiting for your tuk tuk driver to pick you up. That took a while, but then, you have different entrances both sides, somewhat confusing. And an experience a Westerner only cautiously attempts: here you HAVE to walk over the tracks to get to the main hall. This station adjoins the pittoresque Pettah Market. Colombo’s main train station is very easy to navigate and it is the gateway to a number of cities in the country. I took the train from here to Galle and the whole process was easy, painless and quick. There is a left luggage facility which is very cheap and convenient and some places to eat. Next to the station there is a big market if in need of t-shirts, clothes, adaptors, etc. The trains are a bit old but comfortable and well maintained. The ticket staff is so friendly and helpful! this is the main place in srilanka. you can get all transport here. and if you want to know the railway schedule you can srch in google. for a example ( colombo to kandy train schedule) then you can get the all train time with the price. more info any help contect me +94779992177. this place have free wifi but its doesn't work good. We travelled by train a lot in Sri Lanka. So we used this station several times. It looks like chaos, but once you get near the platforms, you can ask about platform numbers, times etc. Beware taxi and tuktuk/taxi touts when you leave the station. Walk at least 100m away before flagging down. It took me around 45 mins to get to the station from CMB airport. I booked the ticket in advance, The staff and conductors of the station were friendly and helpful, the train moved exactly at the time stated in the ticket but it arrived at the destination around 1 hour late than that was it supposed to. I took the Colombo Fort-Habarana train. The train is a great way to enjoy the green beautiful sceneries of Sri Lanka, tickets are cheap but booking through 3rd part website makes it like x3 times more expensive. Train is not really suitable If you have an oversized luggage, It will be hard moving through corridors. And Don’t expect luxury trains. The Observation salon (non A/C) was very classy and the view was amazing for people sitting right at the end of the train. Second class seats were comfortable and had a less stuffed atmosphere, and although it's less cleaner than the Obs salon, it's definitely worth its cheaper price. (price gap over Rs.500) Vendors come to the observations salon as well with fruits/water. Seats are reclinable, but some are broken down a bit. CONS- Although the best view is at the rear end, towards noon it gets very sunny and the window glass is fixed shut in that row. The seats at the other end of the compartment are cooler, but the odour from the washrooms are strong, especially when the compartment door is kept open. There was a 2 hour train delay in our train; keep in mind when making plans. The Colombo Fort Railway is easily accessible by buses from various parts of the city. Once you're here, you can easily purchase tickets to wherever your next destination is... We imagine that the process of purchasing train tickets has not changed here for a century. It is kind of charming really but you must have patience and remember that it is best to plan ahead by a few days. Otherwise you may find that ""you can't always get what you want"" as the Stones put it but we did eventually find what we needed. First class tickets sell out rather quickly. especially for morning departures to popular places like Kandi. It looks old but attractive and having a old days charm from outside. As loke other railways stations it was crowded but we enjoyed even in the rain. When we visited Sri Lanka, this train station was a bit of a hub for us.  We had to make several stops, and one departure through this train station, and each time we commuted it was a learning experience.  The first thing we learned was don't trust anybody when it came to where your train was leaving, sometimes not even your ticket.  The only people that seemed to know which platform our train was leaving was a group of def people that would help you find your train, and help with your bags, then demand a large tip. Cleanliness was also a second thought in this station, it was so bad that I didn't dare use the bathrooms from the smell alone. There also isn't much as far as places to get snacks or a meal if you're transferring.  Best to go outside and enjoy some of the street kiosks if you can instead. Security was also pretty non-existent, unless you're a traveler. It seems that if you have a bag, a ticket, and look confused security will stop and make sure you're not breaking into the station.  However if you're a random person selling something, a scam artist, illegal cab driver, or any other person you're welcome to come in no questions asked. The reason this station doesn't get a completely poor review is that it's a pretty nice building.  Under the layers of dust it's pretty interesting.  I took a few pictures there that really are spectacular.  Notionally you'll need a train ticket to take these pictures, but if you don't have a ticket, security might just let you through anyways. After a month of traveling by train in Myanmar, where train workers were super helpful, we encountered the ticket people at Colombo's train station, some of the rudest and unhelpful workers we encountered on our three month journey through Asia. It's confusing which counter you go to ... and once we bought our tickets to Matara, and caught the train a day or two after, we were chagrined to discover the train was already full when it arrived to the Central Station, and we had to stand a long time. Not the entire way, but until a good many people got off. It seemed like a typical experience. No one seemed surprised, and other reviewers mention it, too, in their reviews. The train station is in about the same area as the bus station, which makes for major traffic congestion, depending on when you go. The good news is this was the most annoying train station (I think) we encountered in Sri Lanka, so if you successfully maneuver this obstacle, it's downhill all the way. Old station but importantly serve it's purpose, daily commute for many & surprisingly punctual too albeit very crowded during rush hours... hanging outside the train! There is lots of talk on this thread about scamming tuk tuk drivers. If you are at all concerned about this you can use Uber, for a tuk tuk or a car. Myself and my partner have been using Uber a lot in Colombo and Galle and though the local tuk tuk drivers don’t like it you can get a much better idea of prices for journeys. Sure you are probably paying more than local price but in reality this might amount to $1. It’s even possible to use Uber Intercity, though tolls are extra on top of the quoted Uber price. Most of the drivers we’ve had a young and courteous and a trying very hard to please. Train travel whilst in Sri Lanka is a must.  Much more pleasant than catching the buses but having continuity in ticket prices and bookings does not exist.  First class gives you air conditioning and generally a seat (not too crowded) but best to only have carry-on luggage.  Third class is as many people as possible in.  There are loads of deaf people who come to the station to help tourists find their way around.  They then expect donations for their services. This is where most trains pass through and most long distance start from , there are a few enquirers counters , in day time there is a small office where travellers can get help Book in advance for cross country trains in the reservation room , local train counters etc are all in English a large LCD screen shows times platforms destinations now Keep your bags with you at all times it’s busy busy place , avoid rush hours where many thousands commuters come in and out of the city Watch out for tuk tuk drivers outside , if you need transport onwards insist on a meter cab / 3 wheeler Enjoy it’s an experience The minute one walks into the Fort Railway Station you are transported 50 years or so back. It was built in 1908 and did not appear to have had any upgrading work done. I was told it had 10 platforms and steps and a bridge connecting to these. One modern aspect is the display screen but one could not trust whether the information was accurate. It was very noisy, sometimes painful to the ear as each train entered and left the platform. One could hardly hear the other speaking. Maybe I am old and sensitive to this noise. There were security/ticket checkers sitting at entry and exit points. However it was easy to push through the crowds and enter the station without any checking. Inside the station, there were some seats but not enough for the number of passengers waiting. Our train was to Jaffna leaving at 5.45 am. I wanted to check something about my ticket. There were no information or ticket counters inside. However there was a room where several men were seated behind their desks. There were no computers, everything done manually. If you expect western standards you may think the men were not interested and unhelpful. However, this is the way it seems things are in Srilanks, there are no queues and people tend to push with the 'me first' attitude. I did get my answers to my questions but also advice that one of the trains I had booked my return journey was a slow train taking 10 hours. I was grateful for this information and was able to change my ticket. Unlike airports there are porters to help with your luggage I did not see any porters here. I actually loved this antique railway station. I had a trip from Colombo to Kandy. It was pre booked. Train arrived on time and had a wonderful & safe journey. Gate ticket checker was polite and willing to give directions . But inside the station was not properly maintained, managed. Toilets were disappointing. Food stalls were really busy and they didn’t care about their customers. I bought 02 no’s of vegetable roti from one of stalls which was close to platform 02. I was so disappointed to say one vegetable roti was spoiled.Both had different fillings as well.I brought that matter to stall owner, it seemed he didn’t care. All they need money and they have an enough flow of customers.May be that might be the reason.Please stop selling spoiled foods. Kind enough to give value for money. At least not to argue. Used plastic bottles, plastic bags were scattered everywhere. It seems nobody cares. An ambience of the station must upgrade, facilities should also update as station is not only visited by locals but also  by foreigners as well. Food stalls should be audited for food safety plus security. For your reference. Thank you for everyone who helped. This station serves the entire Sri Lanka very well. But if yo are a Traveler who are going to use this, be ready. This is not a very clean and tidy place. This station is very crowded. Specially 6.30 a.m. to 6.30 p.m. How ever there are facilities to book long distance trains. So allays book your train. Most of the times trains goes as scheduled. Important advice - get here with plentyof time to spare!  There are people everywhere, trains coming and going, bewildered tourists wandering around, locals cramming ontop carriages and no signs or announcements which platifrm your train departs from.  You need to find someone official looking in a uniform and ask which platform your train leaves from and then probably get a second opinion!  As I said, a great travel experience. There are several trains bound to countryside. So you can find your way through train which is very cheap compared to other form of transpotation.There is  counter to reserve ticket in advanced too. This is the main train station in srilanka. but it is horrible place to see. very unclean and no facilities for foreigners also for locals. staff are very lazy and they don't inform very well. very disappointed place to have a tickets to go badulla. We were expecting the worst based on the mixed reviews on TA but to our surprise it was ok. The station was clean, very busy and hot with very few amenities. Signs are not cleared but there are enquiries counters which will aptly guide you. For our case, we were directed to counter no 17 (berth/intercity/reservation/Expo Rail) which essentially is a small air conditioning room. Inside this room, just queue at the respective ticket counter. We showed our pre booked Expo Rail reservation no on mobile (no print out required) and our boarding ticket issued. In fact you can pickup the pre booked Expo Rail boarding ticket before your scheduled departure from 6am-4pm daily (note: counter 17 close lunch time 12.30pm-1pm). Aside on Expo Rail was excellent. Clean, comfortable A/C ride, with free wifi, clean toilet, snacks, bottled water and movie. Heading towards Kandy on Coach 3, best seat 2, 4, 10 on the right with big window. Others have 2 smaller windows. Seat 5 has no window. 3 star for the station, 5 star for Expo Rail. This is an old-style railway station with nine platforms. There are separate toilets (accessible by key) for foreigners.  The male 'general' public toilets weren't spotless, but they were far from the worst I've seen in Asia. The station can be very busy as hordes of commuters use it. Long distance trips such as to Badulla or (shorter) Kandy are extremely scenic.  Fares are cheap, and some trains have openable windows that are preferable to air conditioned carriages. There are some shops, and provided one takes the usual precautions with smartphones and wallets/purses/bags, the station area is safe. Staff are helpful though the level of English proficiency varies. One of the main down turns is the very discourteous staff from Ticket collectors to the booking office. They have forgotten that it is the ""PASSENGER"" whose fare pays them their salary. To them the passenger is a botheration. They glorify in the 8.30 to 4.30 job they do, like the man just mechanically issuing tickets, the person who announces train arrivals or departures merely stating a train is cancelled not bothering to inform what time the next train would be. It is a rudderless leaderless place  with a station master who prefers to remain invisible. All the trains starts to costal line, up country , North trains starts from colombo fort. There is booking facility also. They announce all trains in English too. So it is convienient to travellers. There is canteen and washroom facilities too, if you are a foreign there is one special washroom facility in platform no 1.  In evening and morning this station is very busy. Colombo Fort Railway Station is the main Railway head in Colombo. The station building is a colonial era building, which appears to have stuck in the 1980s. For this reason, it has an old world charm to it. It is a relatively small station, however, since Sri Lanka does not have a vast or elaborate rail network, the stations serves the purpose quite well. It is a busy station and appeared crowded. Station itself is maintained neat and clean. The railway staff at the station is quite helpful towards the tourist. For the foreign traveller arriving first time at Fort Railway station, looking for luxury travel may have to rethink again! Fort is hot and chaotic and once you enter the railway station, one cannot escape the experience outside to the similar experience inside.  There is a sense of urgency about everything and yet without the rush. Trains depart to a different timetable to the listed departure time adding a memorable experience to your travels, but not if you are in a hurry to get to work! The good news is that in the midst of all the hustle & bustle, the system works. The best part of the train journey is chugging along the scenic coastal route. I urge any traveller who is brave enough to take a train ride from Fort to various island destinations to experience the train ride as well as enjoy the sites along the coastal route. If you are brave enough, you can also taste various local food carried up and down the carriages by local food traders.  Taking a train journey from Colombo Fort, should be a mandatory experience by all travellers! To travel by train is a turistic attraction in Sri Lanka. Than why not to start here. You can buy cheap and expensive tickets here - there are turist agencies for special trains here. The building of the railway station is nothing extra, but this is the main train station to everywhere - than a goog starting point to travel. The trains are always late and there are no information boards to know which train is which. But there are some local people to help you (they understand the only srilankan announcements) to know which is your train - naturally for money, then give them a tip. The hub in Colombo for trains and the place can be very crowded with people travelling to many destinations in the country. Advanced reservations are required for special seating's. The local train is a smart way to travel within Colombo, especially when one is not pressed for time. The Colombo Fort station is located next to the Pettah market and is walking distance from the Port area as well. busy & main station in sri lanka. full of people but that is ok. luggage room is quite small but staff is kind enough. cheap price for luggage store. good Drop off in front of the station, 10 platforms, and several matrix signs with departure information. Multiple small vendors, benches to sit on the platforms, and free of charge toilets spotted at platform 1 (I didn't check them out, do no idea of the state). If you want to see Sri Lanka then you must take three train rides one to Kandy the ancient capital the other to Newra Eliya and the other trip to Galle all along the coast be prepared for a trip of over 21/2 hours ,the trip to Kandy will take just as long as they stop at every station and its an event in itself with all the hawkers offering you all sorts of short eats , you can get first class seats or do the backpacker thing and go with the natives the train is always full so you can end up standing all the way the scenery is breathtaking and the trip to Nera Eliya 69000 feet up is a  must its just one of those things you need to add to the 100 list befor you depart this beautiful earth the only living planet in our solar system. do not worry you will return to dust from which you came and  be resting till the resurrection . I have been to the for railway station many times. The service we get from teh staff at thr railway station is good but needs to improve. I would be much happier if they could smile and be a little bit more friendlier to us. Heritage at its best. We took a train to Kandy and amazing is mere a word. Old world charm by well managed. If you have already planned your stay you should be fine, it is an average rail station. However if you are a tourist who looks remotely lost you will be escorted to a local travel agency where they will meticulously help you plan your trip and then inflate the price a ridiculous amount. Please don't make the same mistake we made. We went to the station to inform ourselve of the schedule and price for the train to Hikkaduwa.  Sadly we couldn't take it from a station stop near our hotel, we had to leave from the main station. It's a very big station but pretty well organize, it's easy to get information and buy tickets to go where your want. The train seems all to be on time too. That day we took the local train back to our hotel, it was only a short ride but it's was fun, the track along the ocean makes it a nice scenery and it's pretty cheap, it's worth trying it Easy to find and people are very helpful. But inside bit dirty. Although few displays are not showing the information number of display boards are there to find train time tables went to the place very bussy area  lot of people waiting to travel directions are not clear to buy tickets at the station they change to counters  very often Don’t even bother. We got dropped off by the tuk tuk at the back of the station and directed around the front to the ticket counters. In our daze and confusion we were beckoned into the tourist information centre and relaxed thinking we were about to receive some help and direction. However, what we got was some guy making what I have come to believe is a bogus phone call to check on train tickets for us to Anuradapura. He then proceeded to offer us a package deal including driver and accommodation for £70 a day!!! He showed receipts from other travellers before us and everything. We were hesitant so were encouraged to check trip advisor because he has nothing but excellent reviews. Jokes on him, scam scam scam. We declined and we are so glad we did. We got seated tickets on our desired train and, despite him telling us the Kandy-Ella train was fully booked, we got standing tickets on the day. Avoid the tourist information guy, the train station itself is fine. Exactly what you would expect from a busy Sri Lankan city. went to see th e busiest place in colombo the indian and SBI are there. and people are pouring in all roads. the traffic is well controlled and so it is easy for hr pedestrais to cross the road. We walked to the station, asked where to buy a train ticket and got pointed in the right direction. Five minutes later I had our 2nd class tix to Kandy for a few bucks. Easy as pie and the train arrived and departed on time. It is a long bumpy ride but you will have some great scenery to enjoy as well as people to meet on the train. Its the main Railway station of Colombo from where you can get Sub Urban and Long Distance Trains... Located in the heart of Colombo...Old Colonial Building...",3.3,400,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/19/87/c4/12/the-most-beautiful-train.jpg?w=700&h=400&s=1,0.0,35.400516795865634,15.245478036175712,3.875968992248062,13.178294573643411,32.299741602067186
Damro Labookellie Tea Centre and Tea Garden,"Damro Labookellie Tea Centre and Tea Garden. Found this was more enjoyable than I thought. The factory tour was really interesting to see the processes. Our guide was so lovely and very informative. We’re from England so love tea and this was the best we ever tasted! We know now all the stuff at home is blended but the single origin premium quality they produce is so good. Definitely recommend this place and the tea they sell there is reasonably priced so we bought some to bring home Good place to visit testing tea.any one want a really experience about tea,visit that place and buying for best tea in the Sri Lanka. Interesting place and you are in Sri Lanka so you have to go to a tea plantation. A working plantation and 24 hour factory with a visitors centre set up for tourists. The whole thing is well done but of course the gift shop is more expensive than in the town. You can also do a 4 wheel drive tour which we did not do but according to people staying at our accommodation it was well worth it. Very stunning tea factory just outside the main city area. The factory tour was great, and having a tea and cake looking out to the tea fields was really lovely. Went on Last Saturday (13/08/2019) to have a cup of tea from Damro Labookellie Tea Centre. Was waited more than 1 hour after placing the order. But didn't receive it. Also the staff was very impolite and not speak properly with customers. This need to be corrected if you need to run this in future in good quality. Stoped off at this tea plantation en route from Kandy to Nuwara Eliya. Very busy with lots of tours. I got a lovely lady who gave me the factory tour . I really enjoyed it and learning about the whole process from planting to harvesting and processing. This was followed by a complimentary cup of tea and a slice of delicious tea cake ( small fee). You then had the option of purchasing some teas from the show rooms. Best Tea Factory by far, the fee tour and tea tasting was amazing. Set in a perfect location! Definitely order the cake with your tea at the end!!! Amazing!! A good tour of the factory telling you all about the process, it was interesting... Smelt amazing. Tour guide was knowledgeable and friendly. Lovely cup of tea after. Good shop with full range of teas as you'd expect. We have a guided tour about the work steps of tea - from picking to cupping in German it was very interesting to see what is done here Finally we got three cups of tea for tasting for free The very good cake was to pay The adjacent shop invited you to shop but you could not have. I want to thank this person for his great sympathy and kindness in showing us the LABOOKELLIE factory. I don't remember her name. The price of the tour to the factory is too expensive is 30 euros per person, it is interesting the explanation they give you, they give a free Te rate which you must accompany with something of the letter q they present you, the road to know the tea plantations is very deteriorated, you go all the time taking leaps, I hope that the wages they pay their workers of the plantations are decorous because it is a very hard work that women do in the sun , I did not see anywhere q could rest, drink water or eat something or q I saw no signs that they had anywhere to rest or go to the bathroom at any time. I get a very bad impression of the conditions of the workers on the plantation. The ""leadership"" has max. It took 10 minutes. It's free, but you don't really see anything. Especially no employees.  It's reasonable to assume it's an abandoned factory. Afterwards there is a cup of tea to sample but then you are urged to buy (overpriced). For a lot of money (60€) you can pick tea yourself and get photographed. The experience is not really worthwhile. Maybe there are better alternatives? We enjoyed our factory tour and tea tasting very much. Our guide was delightful, and the surrounding scenery was gorgeous. There is a large shop where you can purchase tea in various containers but no pressure to buy. Tour is free although we tipped our guide generously. Disappointing Experience – Not Welcoming to Asian Women As an Asian woman, I felt deeply uncomfortable and disrespected during my visit to this tea factory. From the moment we arrived, the staff consistently directed their attention only to my boyfriend, who is Western, and completely ignored me. At reception, the woman arranging the tea tour asked only about my boyfriend’s nationality and spoke solely to him, despite both of us standing there. During the factory tour, another staff member again asked only about his background—and not mine—while asking other couples (including a Nepali couple) where they were from. Later, in the tea room, the waiter brought the menu and asked only my boyfriend if he wanted to order anything. When he declined, the menu was taken away without even acknowledging me. It felt as though I was invisible. This kind of behavior from a well-known tea brand is incredibly disappointing. No one should feel disregarded or devalued based on their ethnicity or the nationality of their partner. I sincerely hope the management reflects on this and improves their staff training to ensure a more respectful and inclusive experience for all visitors. This is a tourist trap for sure, the very quick tour of the tea making plant was informative and the guide was helpful;. I think the tour should have shown you some actual tea picking  and a walk in the tea bush fields which very close by. The after tour free tea was nice but hurried. Lots of variety on sale, expensive but like most we bought a packet as a souvenir . Lastly yhre Health and Safety in the factory wasn't good, no belt guard and a big wheel at knee level spinning vey fast, accidents waiting to happen. This was a free tour, you could pay a tip at the end if you wanted to but there was no pressure.  We were asked to sit and wait 5 minutes for an english guide who was very good and she explained the process to us very clearly and we saw quite a lot.  I was impressed with the tour and felt it was quite comprehensive. 150 year old factory and the wood the use in drying process.  You get a tea tasting at the end and can buy teas if you want to, but again there was no pressure to.  Got to purchase a slice of cake to go with your tea which was really nice.  We had already watched the tea ladies picking the tea, so this was ample for us and enjoyed very much.  We could also take photos which other tours dont allow. I love tea and this place was everything I hoped. Our guide that took round the factory was friendly and very knowledgeable. We were not rushed and could take lots of photos and ask as many questions as we wanted. Wish we had picked tea leaves ourselves but the weather wasn't great . The tea room and cakes were gorgeous. I didn't feel pressured into buying anything. Didn't take too long either and the cafe and decked area offer fab views. Being tea lover, thought of buying some best tea from a very big tea estate and as promoted by them, I bought both Golden tips and Silver Tips tea. There is no aroma in it and though looks good but taste is not there. So without flavour and aroma, I don't see anything special in their best of the best teas. For people visiting first time in tea estate, will be good experience but suggest not to buy expensive teas from here Really enjoyed the tour and tea at Damro. Our guide was very helpful in explaining the many steps involved in making tea. After the tour, we were treated with some quality tea and delicious cake. The estate itself is very scenic and has some walking trails. The tour of the production process was very interesting (albeit it only takes about 10-15 minutes) and our guide was very knowledgeable and spoke good English. You don't pay for the tour or a cup of tea afterwards (a piece of cake you do pay for) but the tea to purchase in the gift shop was very expensive compared to what you could pay for similar in a Sri Lankan supermarket My favourite part was the tour and how they really explained it Tips for future Travellers get the tea cake and the chocolate cake it is amazing the tea is absolutely awesome 🤩 Lovely place to visit, especially if you are a tea afficinato! Many varieties of tea on display and for your putchase.  Frankly I found the tea prices quite high and overpriced....not sure why Silver and Golden tips were about $40 USD for a small box!!! Staff on site to answer questions and help you select our purchase. There is also an indoor and outdoor tea garden.  You are served 1 cup of black tea each person for free and can additionally ourchase a slice of chocolate cake to go along with your tea.  It was an ideal and pleasant experience. Very interesting tea factory tour, we got to pick tea in the plantation. Check for leeches after! We had a piece of fabulous light tea butter cake and got to taste their super fresh BOP tea. After I was able to buy a lot of tea from their efficient tea shop. The place was absolutely crowded so the staff rushed people to try and get through the number of people that were there. They joined two tour groups together and then rushed through the tour. The tour guide had excellent English and she ended it by seating us at a table and asking if we wanted a cup of tea and piece of cake (the cake would cost extra) and pointing out the shop. When we went to the shop and asked to taste the tea, we were pointed to the tea tasting area. Apparently this should all have been explained during the tour. However, she was too busy trying to rush through the tour to bother. With so any tea plantations in the area, choose a smaller one which will give more personalised service. I would say that was the most coolest tea I have ever had even without sugar.Exactly this may be the reason why they say sri lankan tea is the best !!! Nice surrounding & friendly crew too ! We came here on recommendation. There are always free tours on offer, which are entertaining and free, but don't take long. The process of making white and black tea is explained. At the end there is a free sample (breakfast tea). If you want cake: 450LKR (very tasty!!) Extra sample of other types: 250LKR each. In the shop you are not pressured to buy anything. And we really liked it. We visited on a Saturday morning and the drive from Nuwara Eliya to Damro is not far but the views was absolutely breathtaking as it was a clear morning and seeing the people working in the plantations was an amazing sight. At the tea factory we were taken on a tour by a very knowledgeable guide and we truly enjoyed it and learned a lot. We then had a very nice cup of tea to finish off the tour. They do offer tours (safari) into the tea plantations but we did not do that. Would recommend a visit. We did find the shop a bit expensive. No customer service. Please give some training about how to handle customers. If local customer service area is full it’s better you transfer them to foreign area without asking us to leave. It’s such a shame you guys are treating foreigner more than locals. The service should be equal. Staff only give 100% to foreigners not locals. Very disappointed about damro. Located near Nuwara eliya, damro is a national tea brand that makes a lot of variations of tea. This one is located amongst the tea estates and offers a great view of the valley. The staff takes you for a guided tour of the tea estate which hardly runs for 10 minutes and then offer you a complimentary cup of tea. The focus here is on selling lose tea and tea bags which are highly priced. Overall a good place if you have never visited tea estate of plantation. They also have a  cafe where you can have some good stuff though priced heavily. Fantastic. Excellent place with a view of the plantations. Indelible memories. It is possible to visit the factory and taste the tea... Never knew there were soo many varieties of tea. Was nice to see inside a working tea factory. The complimentary tea at the end was nice too. Shop is a little pricey though. The lounge/show room is located at the Labookellie tea estate factory premises about 20 km from Nuwerelia hill resort town. The emphasis on the name of the tea brand seems to have changed  from being Damroo to Labookellie. The original brand name was Mackwood Labookellie Tea Estate which is about a century old tea brand. The place is crowded with foreigners and the parking lot was too hot with  no tree for shade. The overstretched staff were busy with their hands full. It took considerable time to draw the attention of the staff. The smile from the sales staff is missing. Free pastry and tea were provided for the visitors. The packaging of the tea has improved with airtight containers. The price of the packaged teas have also been considerably jacked up. The company seems to be going in the reverse direction by increasing the  tea prices many fold  while the janatha is clamoring for reduction in prices. Instead of buying good quality but over priced tea packets from the show room, visitors could also explore the other tea show rooms in the vicinity like Rothschilds, Oakray Tea Bush, Ramboda for alternatives. The company could also explore reverting to the original name Mackwood Tea brand if IPR licenses are still held by the present owners. Expensive. Nice place.  We were take tour of the tea manufacturing life cycle.  Followed by tea.  Amazing place.  We purchased ginger tea which was really good compared to what I had earlier. We stopped here on our way from Kandy to Nanu Oya. The views of the tea fields are amazing. We had a short free tour around the factory which was really interesting and informative. Then they offer a complimentary cup of tea which was delicious. Bought a couple of items in their shop, more photos then on our way! Perfect place to stop for half an hour on a journey through the mountains Tour was not long but very informative. Beautiful views from the car park. Bought a lot of tea but beware the White tea is very expensive. I asked the price of several boxes and they were no more than 790 rupees. When I got to the till I discovered the Gold white tea was 8500 rupees. Bought it anyway but just so people know there is a big difference in the price of some of the tea. Now back home and it all tastes amazing- drinking the ginger tea just now and it is beautiful. Well worth the money. We had a very informative tour - unfortunately it was on a Monday morning, so there was not much going on in the Factory as the pickers did not work on the Sunday. The guides are all provided by the factory, so are very knowledgable The tea lounge serves an excellent cup of tea (as you would expect) and the cake is scrummy and very reasonably priced. Well worth a visit This is a tea plantation with great views onto the hills at Nuwara Eliya. On arrival, you'll be offered a pot of tea for free, and you can buy a slice of rather nice cake to accompany it. After that, you'll be shown around the factory floors where you can see the process of grading, drying and conditioning the tea leaves. It's a short tour, perhaps 20 minutes, but very interesting. After the tour, you can browse in the shop if you wish to buy any of the products. Very good. We had a lovely guide called Shiroma, she was lovely and had great English. We enjoyed the tea and cake afterwards Explore the iconic Damro Labookellie Tea Factory with Cultural Ceylon Tours. Nestled in the lush hills of Nuwara Eliya, this historic factory offers a unique insight into Sri Lanka's world-renowned tea production. Witness the intricate process from leaf to cup and enjoy a refreshing cup of Ceylon tea amidst breathtaking views. We visited Damro as it was recommended by our driver and it was a great tour, incredibly informative! We were driven into the plantation, where there are some wonderful viewpoints and picture opportunities and then got to pick tea ourselves, with our guide also explaining which leaves were used for what tea. Afterwards a lovely employee showed us around the factory, whilst quite a brief tour it was informative and interesting and she was very nice! We were served some tea to try for free and I also had the tea cake (400 lkr = 1.10$) which was very nice! We had a tour first. Then we some tea. It was free. Piece of cake was less than a euro. Good cake, really nice Tea. Would definitely recommend the free tour if you’re in the area. The cup of tea afterwards is a lovely treat and we also enjoyed some cake from the cafe! Lovely shop too. It was fascinating seeing the tea making process from plucking to pot. I must admit sadness learning pluckers are $AUD5 daily and white tea sells for $AUD125 for 50 grams. It was great to see the inside of a tea factory and learn about the process of tea making. Unfortunately we arrived on. asunder so much of the factory was not in action. I would have liked to have learnt some more about the history of tea in Sri Lanka though. A nice experience having tea and cake at the end of the tour. Super exciting tour. Short and simple, gave really nice insight into tea production.Good tea and cake. Very friendly people. This is a lovely set up. Earlier this was the Mackwoods Tea Factory, but now it seems that the owners have changed and the entire place has seen an upgrade. Once you arrive, you have the option of going in for a free tour of the factory (15 minutes approx) where you will learn how tea is made. The guide patiently briefs you about the most important details of the tea making business and in the end show the different varieties of tea as well. You can taste the tea as well. Once the tour is over, you are welcomed into the tea lounge, where you can drink unlimited cups of tea as you want. Whilst the tea and sugar are provided, there is a minimal charge if you want milk. They also sell chocolate and tea cakes, both simply done and lovely. The views are SPECTACULAR, no other word can describe it. They have a nice viewing platform that doubles up for outdoor seating (if the weather permits and its not raining) and the experience is very nice and pleasant. Overall, very enjoyable and relaxing, and a special mention to the friendly, respectful staff that are hired there. We had a nice little tour around the factory. The girl who showed us round was brilliant. Great to see how tea is produced. You can go on a jeep tour and tea plucking experience for a hefty sum of money. We would have had to wait 2 and a half hours before the next tour and the price was so high we didn’t do it. Once you have been in the factory, they bring you back in to the main area where they show you the colour difference in the teas. You then get shown the tea buying area where they chase you around trying to sell you tea products. They do give you a free cup of tea and we had some cake which was really nice. Travel with Dimma to Damro Tea in Labukele while driving NuwaraEliya  and  feel the Srilankan uniq Vibrance and feel like Wow.Visit Srillanka.This is best time When they heard that we were Italian they entrusted us to a guide who spoke Italian and learned it simply by listening to tourists. Very good at explaining the whole process that revolves around tea. At the end of the tour they offered us a tasting of really good Black tea. You can purchase sweets to accompany. At the end there is also a shop where you can buy different types of tea. If you're on the road I recommend a stop in this Factory. The experience takes a maximum of 40 minutes, excluding all the time you want to stay and taste tea in the dedicated room. We visited Damro Teas as part of our tour with Dinesh from the wonderful D S Tours (see seperate  review).  We had a guided tour of the factory from Siroma which was very informative.  Afterwards we opted for a vehicle tour of the tea plantation (extra cost).  We are so glad we did, we had numerous photo opportunities with the driver taking many photos of us😀.  We also got you meet some of the lady tea pickers who were lovely.  Thank you to all staff involved in our factory tour and plantation tour. We enjoyed this tour of the tea plantation and tour of the processing area. Tour guides are well informed and can answer any questions you may have. From seeing the ladies picking the tea, the drying and sorting process to the actual cup arriving at your table is an experience  worth taking. The ""tea cake"" was delicious too. Lovely views over the plantation. Their is a shop where the various teas can be purchased at reasonable prices. Today we went to Damro with an organized tour and the experience was quite bad. Explanations of simple and quick guides and worst store prices. Totally abusive. A trap for full-blown tourists. I recommend not buying anything there. In the normal shops of the village, you can find teas of other brands for a third of the price and with a quality equal to the Dumro. We were not even given a guided tour of the plantation. A real disaster visiting. Having visited this establishment on a Sunday... ( CLOSED...), which the guide we used didn't know.. ABSOLUTE waste of time.. A company guide literally rushed a group of us through the factory.. It was empty of employees, and so we saw nothing of how the process works... It took no more than 10mins to go through to the area where we Began the tour.. Then we were shown the the area where all different teas were available for sale.. So for me it's purely a 'sales push..' Total waste of time in my opinion There is a large decking viewing area at this establishment.. Where you can look at the rows of tea bushes.. Under this decking you will find the very very poor locals, who have no income or jobs.. Begging for you to throw a few notes over the handrail of the decking.. The tea pluckers earn around 2,000 rupees per day.( aprox £5.) They have to pluck 20kgs per day for that pay.. So sad .. Would never return.. You only find out information once you actually leave and the guide explains more... We have visited this while we were heading from colombo to nuwara eliya.. view is simply  awesome and amazing... worth a visit We had a very interesting tour of the tea factory. In a short amount of time we learned a lot about the tea-making process for white, black and green tea. Afterwards we were treated to a delicious cup of both black and white tea. We even took a box home with us. Lovely excursion but bought 100gms of tea for £35. The price was in Sri Lanka Tupperware so was confused but think the cost of the tea was excessive Went on a plantation tour, where it started raining, and our driver said to turn back after 10 mins and get a refund, which was then denied upon discussing with the people inside. They claimed that we had had the full experience despite the receipt showing we only paid for it half an hour before, and not having chance to even pick our own tea leaves, they repeatedly claimed we had got the full experience and no refund could be given, contradicting what the driver had told us. This appears to be a purpose built tourist attraction, but never the less is worth a visit. Pickers work on the tea terraces around the location and the tea making process is well demonstrated within a ""mini"" factory environment. Tea is served free of charge after the tour, a cake is available at a very small charge. There is a gift shop selling tea, but you are perfectly free to exit the facility without visiting the shop, which is on the opposite side of the building from the exit. Our tour guide spoke excellent English and was very knowledgeable when asked questions. We definitely learned something about the different kinds and grades of tea. It is what it is, It is what it is, but if you want to know how tea is made, then this a free attraction worth visiting. We enjoyed our visit to this tea plantation. We had personalised service of a guide who showed us around and explained the process well. He also answered the hundreds of questions in a friendly manner and had a nice sense of humour. We drank complimentary tea and had cake (purchased) and was attended by friendly waiters and shop staff. The view was lovely. Worth a visit Beautiful place with a Nice view. You Get the feeling they have done the tour a lot of times and they rushed it a little. After the tour you Get some tea and a cake Which were Nice. Have nothing bad to say about the place, just Didnt find it very interesting. ..here. Easy access off the main highway. Its a walk-in operation. You are meet at the door by one of the hostesses.  She walks you through the process and through a tight security viewing areas. Very good English. At the end there is a short presentation on the varieties of tea. Ending with a free cup of tea ..cake costs. ... and a gift shop...(why not?) The price is right and it is worth it for the education. We were at Damro's on the decision of our driver who advised against the other producers of the place as he also had to stock up on you. Unfortunately I am very disappointed with the purchase. The reasons are as follows: the finest teas they were exorbitantly priced so I bought Planter's Whisper 2,800, BOP Labookellie 1,500 and the Green Tea Labookellie 1,450. Except for Planter's, the other teas are powder. If I wanted to buy this kind of tea I could go to a Cargills and save a lot of money. The tea we tasted during the visit was certainly of superior quality. Conclusion: do not get advice from the driver if he insists on going only to places and not to others (there are many manufacturers), read the buyers' reviews the day before and you will not be disappointed. Kind regards. A nice educative visit to the tea factory. The highlight of the trip is the free tea at the cafe upstairs and you can order their pizzas and tea infused cakes which are quite tasty. Arriving at the end of the day, my tour felt rushed. No samples of the high end tea were available. I opted not to buy tea. Found better deals elsewhere. We very much appreciated the very informative factory tour, led by our knowledgeable guide, Bosco. Developed a much better understanding of tea production and varieties. The tea room and shop are also excellent. Prices are reasonable for the high end products. Picturesque setting for one of Sri Lanka’s largest tea estates, with glorious views of the hills and valleys it occupies. We were on our round trip here at the Dambro tea factory. There was a small free tour at the beginning where you were shown and explained all the production steps. Afterwards we each got a free cup of tea of your choice and additionally three other variants. However, these were only available per table, which did not bother us personally. Km adjacent shop you could, if you wanted, buy the different teas. There was no compulsion to buy here. Best Tea factory in nuwaraeliya. We  can reach on the way from gampola to nuwaraeliya road when pass the ramboda. You can take factory tour and Tea garden tour in there. Having tea with cake best at the evening. Efficient visit and tasting. If you buy however beware because no prices are shown and the checkout cashiers unhelpful. No exchange once they have posted the sale. I had a tour of the tea centre which was interesting, then had tea and cake.  The tea was really good.  Good range of teas to purchase. The place on the way to Nuwara elliya is a perfect stop over for a nice complimentary tea with a visit to factory as well. The place provides good photo shoot location amidst the tea garden surroundings. A must visit. The green tea plantation is stunning. 🤍 You can have some beautiful pictures picking the green leaves. The staff is very careful with the clients and we did not pay for anything because we were with our sri lankan tour guide. The tour is pretty good, although they sit you down to do a “complimentary” tea tasting at the end with all sorts of hidden charges. I also wouldn’t bother with the tea from the tea shop, it’s super expensive. All in all I would say it was an interesting stop, but above all it is a tourist trap. I have found out since visiting that EVERY SINGLE ONE of the tea factories exploit Tamil Indian people for working the tea leaves, paying them barely enough to live. I wish I hadn’t gone. I can’t recommend this place. It’s a tourist money machine. Big bus groups running through the place. Loud, crowded and no nice vibe. I waited for one hour to get a tour through the factory. After asking me to wait nobody came back to me so I left. I would recommend you to go to smaller privat places where they show you how they produce the tea by hand without machines. Watch a YouTube video how the industrial production goes. I think that’s enough. The tour through the factory is for free. There is also a tour through the tea plantations for 15.000 Rs (1h). You get a brief insight into tea production. All of this is kept fairly simple. Then you can try a tea and will then be brought directly to the shop. We can recommend the buffet and the beautiful view. Otherwise we were disappointed. View nice, walking tour but just buy nothing in the store!!!!!! The place is overpriced. You can't give anything back. The tour of the factory and walk through of tea making and distribution process was fascinating, but it was anticlimactic to see that their smallest box of white tea starts at £65!! Better off looking elsewhere for your purchases, but would recommend for the tour and photo taking opportunity of the vast plantations! A visit to Sri Lanka is not complete without visiting a tea planation/factory. And so we visited the Labookelle tea factory (also known as Damro). It was very busy with the car park full of coaches. We went inside and our driver booked us ( no charge) a tour of the factory. After a few minutes, we were taken round by a friendly lady who explained the different stages. This is a real factory so if you are lucky depending on what time you are there, you will see the tea leaves arriving and  going round the stages till it is grounded. After the tour you get treated to some tea (free again). There is a fully stocked shop where you can buy the teas. You will not be able to buy this tea anywhere else as they are not allowed to sell outside the factory! Worth the trip. Nice  views  on hillside  they have  a  free  entrance  and  the  host  welcome you  with a  big  smile. Worth visiting but if  you have  already taken a  tea  factory  tour  I wont recommend  that. A nice experience at one of the biggest tea plantations and factories in Sri Lanka. We saw all the tea process and how it`s made and we tasted a very good tea and eat a delicious chicolate cake. Our driver chose this particular tea factory to visit, this was the only one we had time to visit so have nothing to compare it with in regards to having a better experience elsewhere.  We went on a Sunday which is the only day of the week where the factory is not running so you don’t get to see any of the processes or ladies out in the plantations picking tea.  The tour through the factory was very informative but somewhat rushed and difficult to hear as this is a very popular tour spot, so other groups are hot on your heels as you make your way around the factory.  The tour is free and you are given a complimentary cup of tea on completion, your guide will also try and upsell you in to purchasing an overpriced piece of cake to go with your cuppa.  You are not pressured into purchasing tea however if you wish to buy tea the shop was extremely busy and understaffed so hard to get any info on any tea that you want to purchase as well as pricing.  We did find out why our driver took us to visit this particular factory as we noticed as soon as we purchased he disappeared and came back with his free packet of tea. The outlook of all the tea plants for as far as the eye could see was stunning and we did gain useful info regarding the process from the tour, would have preferred to visit when the factory was working. This is a free and basic tour of a tea factory with a free cup of tea afterwards. It's great Damro does this. I learnt a lot about the tea process. It will take 30 minutes. This experience was truly out of this world! We had the pleasure being toured around by Hansi, who was an excellent guide and explained the whole process of tea making. She was patient and very friendly, which made our entire experience better. The aroma of tea and being able to see the process of harvesting to drying leaves to making what we see in stores was amazing. 100% recommend buying the VIP package and make sure to try the tea cake with their in-house black tea 👌 dont forget to collect their products, which you can only find in this place! The tour was good (free of charge) & the tour guide had great English. She explained the process of how they made tea in the factory. They also provide a complimentary black tea at the end. There is a tea shop but you do not feel pressured to buy anything. Scenery around the factory is beautiful. I opted for the Milk Tea, which was excellent, but a bit on the pricey side at Rs 300 per cup.  The same goes for the tea cake - delicious, but Rs 300 is a bit steep. I originally planned to go to Pedro but canceled those plans based on reviews and tried Damro instead. The best decision I'd made. Damro not only offer a free tour of their factory, but their knowledgeable staff cover the tea processing process extremely well. For 20,000LKR, you can hire a jeep and go on a one hour safari. This also includes a tea tasting at the end. Good value we thought if going with six people like we did. The guide was amazing, really cared about his job, and went the extra mile to take photos for us, answer questions, etc. The highlight for us was learning and trying to pick tea ourselves in the fields. We all have a big appreciation for the work goes into each cup we drink. I highly recommend that if you want to know Sri Lankan tea, go to Damro! This is one of several factories owned by Damro Labookellie and the largest. However, it's still not a huge operation and the walk-through therefore does not take a lot of time - about 30 minutes gets it done. You peer at the operations through glas walls. Nevertheless, i learned quite a bit about tea. The Twining's Orange Pekoe I drink is a milder form of English breakfast black tea etc. This tea factory sends its product to the merchants in Colombo for distribution and export. The capital is also where flavours, such as peppermint are added. The factory does not do any of the flavouring that is the basis for all the options we see in our supermarkets. Of course, the tour inevitably stops in the shop, which is the only place in which you can buy Damro Labookellie tea under its own label. Of course, we bought samples - BOP and BOPF. It's all orange pekoe, but of different strengths. I won't do all the work for you, so check out what these letters mean. It will put you ahead of the game before you visit this attraction. Very interesting short tour, which started with our group being given bags for gathering tea leaves and learning about the wages for the women whose occupation is gathering them. After a tea tasting of several varieties, in a pure state (versus with additives, which is how the teas are normally sold, once purchased in bulk at the auctions), there was the shop, where many of my additional questions were answered. I enjoyed the Golden Tips Tea the best and bought 2 boxes at 50 g each for about $30 each. That seemed expensive, but checking prices once back in the US, I see that it is not readily available and the price is around $75. The quality of what I brought back was very good, and I purchased green and black teas as well. In the past, there was a nice and well-made tour of the factory, now too touristy, often only videos are shown so that you end up fixed in the salesroom. The tea, on the other hand, is one of the best Demonstration of tea processing very interesting. Tea and chocolate cake to follow was a nice way to end our visit. We already visited Bleufields tea-factory, but this was quite complementary. Damro is bigger, produces much more tea which enabled us to see all processes in action. We also booked the tea-safari, which was better than we expected; you go deep and high into the fields, which offers great views. You also get to ‘pluck’ some tea. Madhi explained in detail the entire process for producing tea in Italian. The scent you breathe is truly inebriating. After the visit, an excellent cup of tea is offered and, obviously, you can buy the tech which is offered in different solutions and prices. In my opinion it's a good buy! Summary, quick and even inaccurate presentation of how tea is produced. The purpose is only one: to take you there to sell you tea. Everything else doesn't matter. The worst experience as a chauffuer guide for the past 10 years. I had a very disappointing experience at Damro Tea Factory. I was served a cake that was clearly expired, which completely ruined the visit and raised serious concerns about food safety. When I brought this to the attention of the staff, the supervisor, Thushara, handled the situation very poorly. There was no proper apology, accountability, or effort to resolve the issue. This level of negligence and unprofessional customer service is unacceptable for a well-known establishment like Damro. I strongly urge management to take immediate action to improve food quality control and customer service standards. ATTENTION MANAGEMENT: Unprofessional customer service by THUSHARA (Supervisor) you’re about to lose many chauffuer guides and tourists. This is a working tea factory, which offers free tours of how they manufacture the variety of teas - and it's worth the 20-30 minutes it takes. The Damro factory is buzzing with tour groups and families delivered by tuk-tuks and taxis. The tour through the factory is interesting, and you can learn a lot about the process. You get a cup of tea at the end (you don't choose which type), and you'll be offered a slice of chocolate cake to go with it. The tea is free, the cake isn't. They won't divulge that until later. It seems pretty likely that tuk tuk and taxi drivers get commissions from the tea shop inside, since the drivers strongly encourage you to buy some tea before you leave. And they hang out in the store to make sure you get that purchase through. Hi! We went to the Damro factory and after a tour where they explained to us how they make the tea, we had a tea tasting. Both things were good so we decided to buy some boxes of tea to bring home. In particular, I bought one box of Damro Labookellie Cinammon tea and another of Chai tea. Recently, we opened the tea and we were badly surprised by the bad quality of the tea. They don't have taste neither aroma. We felt scammed. Well organised tour. We were picked up from our hotel and driven to the factory for the tour. The tour was really interesting and enjoyable. Highly recommended This was on our schedules list of places to visit in SL. Very interesting to see how the tea is picked and prepared in the factory. Great experience to see the manufacture of tea. The tasting at the end was great as there were many different teas to taste. We got to pick tea leaves with the proper picking bags. With three teens in tow, they were not very  keen on stopping at a tea factory. But after the tour (which was very interesting) we went down the back of the carpark, and a guide put the tea picking baskets with straps on our heads, and sent us into the plantation to pick leaves. It was so funny! They were so lovely & took photos and videos. We gave them a tip at the end. The tea pickers earn such poor wages. Happy to tip them & it ended up being one of the highlights. Guide kept on saying this is the best among all other factories, not sure how reliable this is but the girl explaining the process was good, they make black and white tea here. Wanted to do a trekking but it was raining hard and their jeep ride was quite expensive to be honest (20000 LKR for 1 hr). Tea sold here is quite expensive when you compare with the supermarkets i guess it's alright if you wanted the pure organic non-blended ones. Accessible place with ample parking space. Good service with quality tea products. You will be ushered by the guides there. Very traditional tea factory with amazing view over the tea gardens. Tea we bought is excellent quality, prices are not low but worth the quality. Only remark is that the tasting area was not refreshed so we couldn't really taste for choosing the tea we preferred, we bought by type instead. I came with family on 25th December 2019 I think this is my 20th visit this place and I never come this place bcz we ware waiting for more than 30min to have tea but staff did not save and they said they don’t know when I ask cashier who took our order she said she pass the order to tea maker and she can’t do anything then tea maker says now they can’t make because it’s time to close, we came here passing so many restaurant but service really bad,specially the cashier girt treat very very badly , she must learn how to talk politely to the clients . With Macwood management this place is very nice , but with damro it’s really pathetic. This was our first visit to a tea growing region, plantation and factory. This region of Sri Lanka is spectacular and beautiful and the tea plantations are a lovely site, including the Damro one. Not a famous brand, but the majority of their tea product is sold into the wholesale market, with the rest sold as own brand on site. The tour of the 100+ year old factory showed the simple process of producing black tea; green tea is produced elsewhere by a slightly different process.  At the end of the tour you are taken to the tasting room, where you can taste the full range of teas from white to black for free. The tasting room is conveniently located next to the shop!!! Here you can know a bit about tea, how they make them. They have also some activities like tea garden safari. You will get a free tea and a very small tea factory tour when you visit the place. here you can find good quality tea but is bit pricey as it is a tourist center. Damro Tea Plantation BAD Experience! Too touristy and staff are not interested and not personal. Biggest regret as Sri Lanka are filled with many nice places and people. Damro staff are more interested in selling than service. In Dec 2019 before the onset of Covid19, I was personally guided around the tea plantation by a fair local girl that gave me the impression very blankly that she did NOT want to be there at all. I asked for permission to take picture of the tea process and accidentally had a picture of her looking nonchalant and sulky inside my picture! A picture paints a thousand word! have since submitted my feedback to my travel agent who checks in on my mum and I everyday. This same girl’s face only lighted up very slightly when my mum and I started purchasing many teas. Another incident that disappoints me was the complimentary black tea which we declined as it was already mid afternoon and we were afraid that the caffeine will affect our sleep when we arrive at Nuwara Eliya. Thus we requested for chamomile or peppermint tea that they said coat Sri Lankan Rupees 700  (USD3.80) which was not expensive but the tea arrived COLD! This is an abomination to a lovely country that prides itself as a top tea country! It was a rainy day in the hills and that was the last thing my poor old mum needed. Very disappointed with the entire experience! I would avoid all the “touristy” restaurants with big tour buses as we were on a private tour as the guide will have a tendency to bring the tourists there for reasons we all know why... so do your homework and have your travel agent give you a detailed itinery as to where to eat etc..we had a wonderful travel agent and I shall visit Sri Lanka again just NEVER to return to DAMRO! The amazing tea experience  and most delicious tea cake i ever tasted. mindful surrounding and friendly staff. everyone should taste the real tea taste of Sri Lanka in Damro Labukellie. This is in an area of beautiful tea country and the landscape is stunning, making for some wonderful photographs.  The factory itself was interesting but not exactly a hive of activity.  I got the distinct impression that no tea processing actually went on there anymore and the equipment and couple of workers were just there for show for the tourists.  I may be wrong in that but considering the tonnes that get produced the processing going on didn't seem to equate.  Shop was expensive with not that great a range.  There were better outlets even just at the airport. The rating is for the scenery and location rather then the factory tour. The views were amazing. The factory tour was free and informative. However, the jeep safari tour of the tea plantation is very expensive and not worth the money. It is basically a jeep ride over narrow, bumpy road a few photos of you picking some tea leaves. We were in the jeep for 50mins of the hour tour and 10mins picking tea leaves and having photos. A total waste of money and time! I visit the factory on factory on 14th January. Fast but nice introduction with a english good speaking woman who showed us the place in 5 minutes. Is not possible to visit the plantations unless you pay 80$ to visit with a jeep. The problem was the prices and quality of products. bought this “cotta guard stone” and wait to arrive at home to unwrap it. There’s not a really smart way to open it, there’s a small hole with the tea inside a plastic bag inside. you can’t take it off. so the black tea is inside this sculpture made of terracotta, when opening it it was already cracked (not my fault, it was packed in 3cm of plastic wrap). when I opened the package, a piece of the box came out. such a pity, terrible quality. I would recommend people go somewhere else to buy the products, as it will be way cheaper and probably with a better quality Stopped in for our last tea factory visit and was pleasantly surprised. The tour is brief but they allow you to take photos which most of the other plantations do not. The fields are lovely and the setting is pretty. The cursory offering of a fine cup of tea ends the tour and the shop is there for you to purchase, without too much pressure. Try to arrive earlier in the morning to avoid any tourist masses that come by bus or van. More than 100 varities teas.( inluding flavoured teas.) Buffet is tasty and fairly priced.. All other restaurant fodder items are fairly priced.. Friendly staff.. Scenery from the surround may not locate from any other place... One of the best tourist attractions in Sri Lanka. I visited the Damro tea centre in Nuwara Eliya.  As soon as I entered I wasn't allowed to have a cup of tea as I need some sort of membership that costs Rs 1,500. I was a bit disappointed as I wanted to try and buy some silver tip tea and the only way to do is to pay the fee.  It was a bit embarassing as I took a seat and then get up and walk out. They need to put a ticket counter so that people entering the tea room could buy the ticket first.  Very disappointed as in the past I never paid any money to have a cup of tea. You probably need to pay for the cup of silver tea on top of this fee.  Will never go there.  Visited another tea estate named Pedro Estate and they even served a nice cup of black tea for free of charge. A short tour around the factory and tea will be served free of charge in the lobby. Cake can be purchased with your tea. Tea leaves cost more than double of what you could find in nuwara eliya. I guess the tuk tuk and taxi drivers get a good cut from your purchase. Learnt so much about how different types of tea are manufactured. Guide was brilliant and extremely knowledgable, answering all of the questions we had about the process at the plantation. Tour lasted about 30 minutes, showing the different processes that the tea passed through, followed by a nice cup of black tea in the café. We bought a few different types of tea that are produced by Damro - definitely worth trying! Highly recommend if you have an hour on the route from Kandy to Ella. A truly magnificent visit to impressive tea fields. It was a rewarding experience to discover the tea culture and taste different varieties. This place, located in Sri Lanka, is known worldwide for its production of quality tea. The tasting and tour is free, possibility to buy tasting teas. Being in the trade for decades and more ,they seem to know the business .Large expanse of the place makes it ready to harbor even larger numbers at the same time ,yet providing enough room for privacy with a lovely cup of tea and cake. It was a very unfortunate experience: The tour of the tea fields at Damro Tea costs a whopping more than $60 per vehicle; With this price and the prestige of this company I thought this type of thing would not happen. However, at the beginning of the tour, when I got out of the car to take a photo, the driver (who continually encouraged me to get out of the car) took the opportunity to take my wallet out of my bag. When I quickly returned I saw him throw the wallet to the ground when he caught it. ""in flagrante"": he only had time to throw it to the ground but not to take money. When I returned from the tour I spoke to the manager, I told him what had happened to me and he told me that he was going to take stockings. He seemed like a reasonable man, so I suppose he kicked out this undesirable person, but, in case that wasn't the case, my recommendation is to always have your belongings under control in case you tour the tea fields or, better yet, go to another field. of the many tea shops in Nuwara Eliya where they take care not to have criminals on staff and take care of their visitors.. We liked the scenery of tea gardens, but the thing which ruined our visit was the tour of the tea factory, the lady was explaining things in a way as she was doing on a gunpoint, we feel she was tired or bored of repeating the same information to people again and again. We had a bad experience at their tea shop too, my wife was very excited and picked every type of tea available at the shop as we are living in the Middle East and are quite fond of tea, but the attendants at shop were not willing to answer our few questions as they were more interested in tourists with white skins even they weren't buying a fraction of stuff which my wife and I was holding , we tried last time at the payment counter to ask again but the lady at payment counter was also busy with our european ,American friends, finally due to of this continuous neglection in anger my wife dumped all of her stuff at the counter and left without buying anything. Factory tour ok, swerved safari as only three of us to fund £40 six seater deal, customer service ok as had place almost to ourselves so taken on tour after a minute when tourists arrived to make up a group, taken straight to table for taster, only didnt buy more as no tasters for product range, shop at gift shop prices but not outrageous. Visited in September 2024. Informative tour of a beautiful factory. Left with several packs of tea, back to Australia. Beautiful loose leaf tea, so much better than the generic brand available in the shops in Aus. Now looking to buy the Damro tea online- I am a convert to the delicious Damro OP tea. There was nothing interesting - it was around 15 mins of tour which ended at the tea shop.  Variety of tea available for sale. On our way to Nuwara Eliya we stopped at the Damro Tea Factory. As u enter, u r approached with a warm smile. One staff member takes u around d factory explaining every process of tea manufacturing. Damro Tea is one of the most popular brands. All through our road journey we could only see their tea estates. After the factory tour is done. U can chill at their cafe area. Tea is on d house. But don’t forget to try their Tea cake and Chocolate Cake. Both were too delicious. And quite reasonable. We saw lotbof foreigners buying bags full of tea. Overall a good visit Loads of tourists at this place where you are taken to a short tour of the facilities and then provided the opportunity to taste some teas before shopping. The teas are priced a bit higher than other parts of Sri Lanka but having learnt they export 80% and provide tea leaves to big names such as Dilmah and Lipton and don’t sell retail might be beneficial to buy We went to the non VIP tea lounge / restaurant on 5th Oct 2025  afternoon hoping for a pleasant experience. But the customer service we experienced was beyond terrible from the staff and one person in particular had extremely rude attitude & completely ruined our evening. Would not ever visit this place & would not recommend to anyone else as well. This place had a good selection of teas for tasting. I had a good experience with the different teas. The unfortunate part of my stop over at this place was the service by staff manning the tea tasting. Service was non existent.  I would even venture to state that there is a preference for Caucasians. I tried several times to attract the attention of the staff as it would have been nice to get some explanation on the teas. Well I agree with Simroch...Too busy to care and that too with the Caucasian visitors. Well if non for the opportunity to sample the teas and the wonderful Chocolate and tea cakes I would have rated this place as Poor. Stopped her for overview of tea making process which began here 1928 by James Taylor didn’t realize everything picked by hand by imported Indian people The tea tasted amazing much better than what we get in the states and the air around plantations smell of tea Very interesting tea factory tour, not too long and very informative. Now we know everything we need to know about black tea, green tea, white tea and golden tea, the plants and the processes involved in producing something we take for granted every day. We had a nice piece of cake and complimentary tea at the end, for a total of around £2, which is incredible for a place like this. We bought some tea in the shop. Yes, prices may seem high to some, but it’s not all about the price, it’s about the experience, the uniqueness of the occasion and the friendly treatment, all of which we got. Highly recommended. Entrance is free, they give free tours of the factory which also includes tea at end. The tour was very informative and interesting, you'll learn about the tea making process of white tea, oolong tea, green tea, and black tea. The view from the factory overlooks the tea plantations. The area around Damro is spectacular, with tea grown on the side of mountains the scenery is really good. Couple of lookout points for nice photos. You can also follow the path down by the river and get a close up look of the tea. Inside the factory it’s a tourist trap, it’s very busy and you feel that they are just trying to get you to buy overpriced tea. Stopped here on our tour. I have to say this was an exceptional tour with a very knowledgeable guide. Very informative. We have visited tea plantations in India, Kerala, China and Nepal and I have to say this was by far the best experience The staff in the shop were very helpful. Purchased some beautiful teas at a very good price. Would highly recommend stopping off here. We really enjoyed our experience here! The tour guide spoke perfect English and was really informative on the tea making process. The tour was really interesting especially if you love tea like us. The tea and cake at the end was amazing and there is plenty of choice on which tea you can buy. Enjoyed the tour and tea tasting. Very informative guide and learnt a lot. We found it well balanced and fairly quick - so not OTT Great informative tour to learn about the tea processes. Lovely views of the plantation and the tea picking ladies and a great taste of the tea after with an option of cake. We had high hopes for this tour which was organised through Trailfinders/Walkers Tours. However, we were left feeling disappointed: Pros Informative & interesting tour of the factory Free cup of tea after the tour Good view of the tea plantation Cons Our tour had far too many people - around 20 people (other tours only had 2-3 people) Difficult to see and hear what was going on (one elderly woman left the tour within 5 minutes) Very expensive & overpriced tea in the shop No option to see the plantation other than an overpriced jeep safari Room for improvement Charge an entry fee Allow visitors to see the tea plantation by walking and not just paying an extortionate price for a Jeep This beautiful estate is as much a tourist factory as it is a tea factory. We initially went into the locals side, which was really interesting and has informative signs and samples out for smelling. However we were quickly ushered to the “VIP area” despite saying we didn’t want a VIP experience. The VIP area was essentially a clinical shop with extremely high prices. I think they were running tours as well, but we were too small a group for anyone to bother with when there were bus groups coming through. We just did the free 30 minute factory tour which was excellent. Couldn’t justify time or cost (c. 32$ each) to go tea picking. Very simple process that has been going at this site for more than 140 years using much of the original machinery! All followed by a (again free) tea tasting. On the road to Nuwara Eliya from this facility you can see some of the 600+ ladies employed as tea pickers across the 1200 acre estate. Makes you appreciate hard work - these folk have to pick 18kg of tips each / day! Ok... the factory visit was short as there's not so much to visit, 1 Drying room and 1 tea plant distribution room.... from there to the shop and tea degustation. the tea is ok (variety, smell, flavours) and also the landscape have nice pictures. Have to visit because the location is a must but do not expect to see nothing out of the usual One of the larger tea plantations in the area, well geared to for tourists. There’s a free tour of the factory or a tour with some tea tasting and a trip up into the plantations which costs around £25 pp (2024) Paid for the plantation tour, and as soon as we left it started raining heavily. 10 minutes in our driver suggested going back and asking for a refund, which we agreed was a good idea. On arriving back the staff and manager were very rude and unwilling to give even a partial refund, saying we had not been forced to do the tour, and that they don’t offer refunds. Very unpleasant experience overall, would not recommend. It’s a shame because the driver seemed genuine and friendly so could’ve made a mistake. This is considered one of the oldest tea Estates in sri lanka. The teas were very good and we enjoyed the tea tasting ,the delicious cake and the charming ,professional service given to us by Shobithan our server. He made us feel very welcome and went out of his way to see to all our needs. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit and the start were very knowledgeable, and professional. Loved learning all about the making of tea from start to finish. The tea and tea cake were delightful. Thank you Tea factory tour was quick and good. The cafe had excellent pizzas and free tea tasting. The safari was an unnecessary tourist trap of LKR 20K and yielded only 2-3 photo opps. Total waste of money! Even the kids were bored. Driver was reckless too. Most of such photos one can get for free anyway as there are many tea gardens all around where one can simply climb up and get similar pics. Excellent tea tour, very informative. Great to sample tea after the tour. Asked for High tea which started at 3pm until 5pm - waited for half hour to start only to then be be told there would be a 45 min wait. Left a little disappointed. Our private driver suggested we go here rather than our planned stop at Bluefields Tea Centre. It was a public holiday for Diwali so the factory and tea picking was not operating. It is free of charge to be taken on a guided tour of the factory. A very slick operation with well spoken guides and a very smart tea room with lovely atmosphere, great views and comfortable table and chairs.  We were able to try Gold Tips and Silver Tips teas which are both very expensive. The hope is you will buy something in their shop and lots of people do including locals. On exiting we were asked if we wanted to buy anything and politely declined and nothing was said. Our driver received a bag of tea for bringing us which I understand happens in all the tea centres. The staff, beautiful view, tea sampling and tour were excellent. Its just beside the kandy nuwaraeliya road. One of a best place to taste and buy god sri lanken tea. Price for a tea for sri lanken is 80 with milk. i always buy tea from here to home. Very big tea shop also for foriegners. The tea factory is well worth a visit .The processes are not particularly complicated but interesting to see,The guide speaks excellent English and there is a tea break at the end. TOP TIP: Do check the infrequent festival dates (eg Jan) as the factory is closed or open but not running on those dates Nice factory, they let you go everywhere  inside and offer a complimentary tea. You can order things from the menu and we tried only their tea cake but it was so good. We even went to the terraces where the tea is and there was a guy informally distributing baskets for tea plucking and taking pics. Of course we left a tip Interesting short tour. Obviously a tourist focussed place with high priced tea. We bought some basic tea and not the way overpriced teas. A real pity that these places treat visitors like fools and price gouging tourists does seem like a sport in Sri Lanka. We bought some great tea in Pettah market where all the locals shop for a fraction of the price. It was pleasant stop in the plantation. They give a complementary tea and explain about the tea processing. You can get some additional pastries along with the tea. We can also purchase tea from their place, though a bit costlier compared to other teas that we get in other retain stores. It was worth the visit. Amazing tea Experience at damro..They provides free factory visit to the tourists and their hospitality is the best part ❤ No coordination between the staff. Last order is at 5:30, we came at 5:15 but they didn't take our order. It was busy but they should know how to handle busy situations. The foreign section was empty, but they said it was only for foreigners. Poor management skill Please appoint proper managers to manager the property. very disappointed. We will never come back. FREE TEA FACTORY TOUR AND TEA TASTING (charges of 25,000 LKR only if you take the jeep up to the tea plantation). A good place to go for the Tea factory tour, the tour and the tasting is FREE but if you want to go to the Tea plantation with the help of a jeep where they will click your pictures plucking tea with a basket around a picturesque background, it would cost your 25,000 LKR as on 08.01.2025. They will try to ""SCAM"" you to take the jeep first and make it seem like that's the only way to go for the tea tour, just say no that you don't want the jeep if you don't want to spend 25,000 LKR and say that you are here for the FREE TEA FACTORY TOUR. hope this helps... Nuwara Eliya is one of the seven major production areas of Ceylonty. Here Damro (formerly Macwood) is the second oldest tea plantation in Sri Lanka and owns more than 5,000 hectares of tea plantations. You can experience tea picking in the tea plantation, visit the tea factory, and taste tea. The shop also sells various kinds of tea leaves produced in this factory. You will fine many place sell tea in Sri Lanka but in this place you will fine the best tea in all over the country beside a beautiful view to see all the tea garden beautiful tea plantation and offered free pure Ceylon Tea. option to buy in different flavors. Thank you Nice place. They have excellent tea. They teach you all the types of tea they have, depending on the quality and cut.  They have a shop selling their tea which is of excellent quality. Amazing tea garden nice view and good quality natural tea good testy good staff everything perfect.. All the groups stop here, or at other large HILL COUNTRY tea factories. Let's just hope there is local capital, and not just British capital invested here. The production process that leads to obtaining green tea, black tea, or white tea (silver or gold variant) was explained in Italian. We were offered a cup of tea, in two variations, and then, for those who wanted it, we proceeded to purchase it. FABULOUS surrounding landscape!! We visited this tea centre as part of a G Adventures tour.  The first part of the visit consists of a tour of their factory to show us how the tea is produced.  This was very interesting with a lot of the equipment in the factory being last century equipment.  Before we went into the center, we saw the older ladies that pick the tea leaves.  Apparently, Sri Lanka has lost tea market share in the world as younger people do not wish to pick tea leaves as it doesn't pay well. After the tour, we had a cup of Orange Pekoe tea which I greatly enjoyed (even more than the tour).  I also bought a piece of chocolate cake which I also enjoyed. We decided to stop here as we read some good reviews, however the teas that we tried were just not good, whereby this is supposed to be a premium brand. Don’t try to ask questions about tea because shop assistants don’t have a clue, other than this tea is strong, this tea is healthy, this tea is good if you need to give a present. Ok. This is a very big business, they have huge plantations and a brand new building however it is very sad to learn about the conditions of underpaid workers. We have visited with the family to the tea lounge and the service staff had rude attitude. They were preventing us using the washrooms even though we have bought tea. And ask to finish our tea soon and leave. I have travelled more than 20 countries and this is kind of worst customer service experienced in sri lanka from a tourist destination. One guy was so arrogant. If you are a foreigner with white skin you should be ok, otherwise I suggest to avoid this place Stopped for a tour and to b sold local tea, but it was a pleasant stop. There was a short interesting tour of the factory and then a tea tasting. Unfortunately we were only offered English Breakfast Tea when there was an opportunity to sample some of the more exotic teas on sale. This was our first time to see a tea factory. Max 45 min you can finish the free guided tour and then have free cup of tea. I recommend you buy hot tea cake for 1 usd. Very nice. They have excellent tea shop, a restaurant and clean toilets. Staff are efficient. The best place to take tea plantation pictures.  A MUST STOP The plantation offers a free pot of tea and you can buy some cakes and enjoy the wonderful views. A quick tour through the factory was interesting and we purchased some tea (at about 750Rps which is not that different to the UK, but it is single source).  There was an  option of a drive through the plantation (which we did not do). Some fantastic scenery on the drive to the plantation too.  Well worth a visit. We took a tour around the tea factory, good guide and lots of information given, great cup of tea and a must in Nuwara Eliya Really beautiful setting and modern building. The staff are super friendly and well organised. We had a great tour guide who was very knowledgable and happy to answer all our questions. After the tour we got to sit down and relax and drink delicious complimentary tea and yummy cake (at a very good price). We would highly recommend this place!! (We also went to Pedro, and Damro is 100 times better) We were driving from Peradeniya to Nuwara Eliya and our driver guide suggested we stop at the Damo Tea Centre for a break and a cup of tea. In the prevailing damp weather, it was a good idea and the cup of tea was very welcome. It was also our first glimpse of the return of some tourism to the country. Visited with friends and placed our Tea, We waited more 1 Hour but we did not get our order also the people who came after us got their orders and we didn’t. The staffs are very impolite and while we ask our order they replied us so harshly and rude Not recommend to people they give their service only for tourists and not for local people Dissapointed! The ""guides"" are not interested at all to show you round, when they do its a monologue script and get you through and back to the very expensive shop as quickly as possible. Not worth the time nor effort. Damro Tea plantation has a big tea estate that caters to local and export needs.  We had a brief 20 minutes tour of the factory.  Picking of the tea leaves is once a week. The picked leaves are placed in huge belts to dry where huge air blowers blow air to aid in the drying process.  This takes about 14 hours of drying. It takes 5 kg fresh leaves to make 1 kg of black tea. Once the leaves are dried they are sent down to the machine where it's rolled and cut as per the requirements.  Then they are placed on the table for fermentation where the process of oxidation changes the colour of the tea leaves. No fermentation for green and white tear.  Then the leaves are sent to the Dryer machine to stop fermentation to turn to black colour.  After this they are sent to the Grading machine for different quality of grading - strong, medium, light.  The tour ends with complimentary light black tea. For the huge acres of tea estate and the fact that it's a factory the rates should've been cheaper than the markets. Was very surprised to see such expensive rates. Enjoyed visiting this tea factory and had a very informative tour of the tea processing sytem and sampled some excellent teas. We left Nuwara Eliya after having breakfast at our hotel. After 30 minutes of driving towards Kandy, we arrived at Damro Labookellie Tea Centre and Tea garden. The tea factory here is actually running and the management offers complimentary 15 minute guided tour around the factory. We learned about various stages of processing of tea as well as about different varieties of tea. Finally we were treated with a variety of fine Ceylon tea. We ended up buying a good amount of tea from the gift shop to take for folks back home. Good day Today we face clear case of discrimination at Damro tea plantation and factory outlet at nuwara eliya. The staff was keen to address ONLY European, Korean, japnese n not paying attention to Asian/Indian people Hope Damro group will note this. Stopped off here on our way to Nuwara Eliy, even though I do not drink tea, the tour was informative of all the processess needed to make tea. Had a cup of tea and slice of cake delicious Great views of the tea plantations. They have tea lounge where they have displayed various varities of the tea grown by the estate. They also take the visitors for a round of the tea factory with a guide who gives a detailed explanation of the whole process.Very educational. Must stop in SriLanka to taste your famous tea. It is the most important manufacturer in the country and guarantee for your purchases. The visit is brief and without anything extraordinary, more than the large production capacity. Then you taste tea, although first tea they put the normal, and if you want something special you have to order it. It has varieties for all tastes and pockets, and its store sells multiple formats, ideal for you or for gifting. Our guide took us to the tea factory & we thoroughly enjoyed the fairly short tour, tea & cake. We had already stopped by the roadside to meet, tip & have photos taken with some friendly tea pickers. The tea selection was very varied & interesting to try. The cake was excellent too. Nice room to sit in & the shop displays are very nice. Some reviews are negative, what do people expect at a tea factory? These people are poor, they work hard for low pay. Go there & support them & their families. The Nuwara Eliya tea factory that we visited is called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre (former Mackwoods) and is the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Their tea bushes are replanted every 100 years on over 5,000 hectares of lush tea plantations. In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro. All the different kinds of teas have different processes of making and you will be able to learn all about these processes if you do a tea factory tour. The factory tour at Damro is free of charge and ends with delicious tea and cake tasting at the Damro Tea Lounge. While the tour and tea are free, the cake tasting has a small charge and the main profit from the tour comes from tourists buying the tea at the gift shop. You do not need to book the tour in advance and the best way to get here is by organizing the 35min transport with your hotel in Nuwara Eliya. Really enjoyed the tea factory tour. This was very interesting and informative. It was free with free teas to sample at the end too. Mesmerised by the process - great to see all this in action. The tea safari tour was also excellent. It is expensive (almost £50 per jeep) but fantastic and unique experience. Bought plenty of tea from the shop too. Very good experience. Very helpful and professional staff. On the drive up to Nuwara Eliyah from Kandy, this is a favourite stop for tour operators. Beware, it is a sophisticated scam. You are taken to a well appointed lounge with a mesmerizing array of tea varieties on display and you are served tea in a teapot and cup - elegant and tasty. Great views and photo ops. Plus a rush trhough the tea factory. Naturally you would like to buy some tea- overpriced. I bought quite a selection advertised as Broken Orange Pekoe. When I reached home and opened the paxck, it was full of fine dust tea. This is a third of the cost of leaf tea. In most places this would be considered a dishonest trade practice. Tip: park your car, use the toilet, have tea offered and take some snaps. But DONT buy the tea here. It's a completely overflowing, short promotional event. A quick look at the drying and sorting and you are through. As a tea fan you like the subsequent tasting. This is a very nice stop in Sri Lanka, which produces the highest quality tea in the world. Firt you can admire the tea plantation, its beautiful and amazing for good pictures. Then tehre is a tour thrgouh the factoory, where they explain every step of the tea production. Very interesting, I did not know that the green tea and the blacj tea come from the same plant. And finally,, you can try a a tea and cake. The tea cake is delicious! please follow us at @mapamunditravel , and if you find it helpful,please give me a vote! Thanks in advance =) The tour itself was informative Tea in the shop was above average prices but diday good presents Jeep tour of plantation was very expensive so we swerved it Our guide took us which had I know. It was extremely tourist orientated I would has asked he took us elsewhere We really enjoyed the tour of the factory and tasting the tea.  The smell inside the factory is lovely!  Also enjoyed the beautiful views and purchased several boxes of tea.  We didn't stop at any other factories but we thoroughly enjoyed Damro. I love tea, so the opportunity to see how the leaves are picked, dried and packaged was genuinely wonderful. Great views, an informative and friendly tour followed by the opportunity to drink and buy the product was perfect for this tea addict. Highly recommended. Recently me and my friends visited this place. Place was quite rush, but the staff welcomed us with a smiling face and the service was really superb. The tea, they served us was one of the best tea in srilanka. I will highly recommend this place to anyone. Well done and keep up the good work Damro Tea Lounge Team. 😇 The factory tour was informative and the sample tea was good, but the even if it's a tasty tea is still very pricey. Mostly because drivers take the tourists there and they get gifts depending on how much the torurists spend. The drive to the place is bumpy and the tour isn’t a must do on my list, but the tea itself is amazing! We bought a bunch of boxes to bring back and use as gifts. The desserts are also excellent Had a tour in the factory, by a sardine lady, then we were allowed to taste tea. You could also buy tea there and have done that. We had read that this was a good address to visit as a tea factory. We had our tuk tuk driver take us there, Upon arrival, a hostess will meet you and ask if you would like to go on an excursion. for 15,000 rupees (€43, 3 of us) we received a 20-minute tour with explanation in the factory and then an hour-long safari through the plantation where we could pick ourselves and the ladies at work could see. The lady who gave the explanation had a terribly annoying voice so I quickly dropped out. She explained the process itself very well and you could see how they worked behind glass. Then we went for a cup of tea in the tearoom before being picked up for the tour. The boy who served us asked if we wanted black tea and if we wanted a piece of cake. I asked if I could drink green tea and I was the only one who wanted a piece of cake. He didn't say anything about it costing money and there was no menu on the table so I thought it was part of our tour. Until the bill arrived that included my green tea and cake. I said I wasn't going to pay it because nothing was said. Our tuk tuk driver came to pick us up to say he was joining us for the ride. Very nice, I thought. Then he doesn't have to wait so long. Got up and went outside. We set off in a comfortable jeep-like car with an open roof. We drove up between the tea fields. We were given a tea leaf in our hands and were allowed to help pick what one of the ladies was doing. we were given a basket on our backs to put the tea leaves in and left our backpacks in the car. I don't know if our tuk tuk driver conspired with the tour driver but they went into our backpacks. They opened our front pockets for me and my son. Afterwards I missed my beautiful pocket knife and my son had €50 taken from his wallet. My daughter and I both had a bag with our money in it, so they couldn't reach it. We only found this out at the hotel. The ladies who work for this company have to pick 20 kg per day and then receive €3.50. We saw them dragging the heavy bags while tourists (us) drive past them in a car. Let them use those cars to transport the tea. This looks like slave labor. It was a worthless trip that didn't last an hour and for which we paid too much money. We might as well have driven up in our tuk tuk. When I returned I asked for my money back. I was unable to speak to a manager and did not get my money back. After all, we had already had the excursion. I left pissed. While we were on our way, our tuk tuk driver received a phone call. They called because the bill for the tea and cake had not yet been paid. I said again that I am not going to pay for it. So, watch your stuff when you go picking and you now know not to have another tea and cake if you don't feel like paying extra. There were so many visitors. At first, we tasted it at Oak Ray, then moved here and toured the factory. The tour is very functional to accommodate a large number of tourists. But the BOP that was then served for free was terrible, and I was even less inclined to buy it. Oak Ray offers a wider variety of tastings and is recommended for its relaxed atmosphere. Great tour of the factory.  We didn’t visit other plantations so can’t compare but the tour was very informative.  There is a 4 wheel drive tour of the estate that looked fun but we couldn’t get on as it was busy.  Not sure if you can prebook this, if you can I’d recommend it.  Take the time to walk down the the river (10min) and through some of the tea groves as are you really get to see what it’s like to be a picker it was simply a brilliant experience going through the process of making tea. very sporty guide. enjoyed tea with their home made pastries. lovely tea shop where i had to indulge into it. friendly warm services which you definitely get every part of sri lanka. the people of sri lanka are such...warm and friendly. a very memorable trip indeed. A good place to enjoy a flavorful cup of tea. You can also visit the tea factory (but currently not allowed due to COVID-19). A great place to purchase high quality tea. Oh and their cakes were good! Nice place to have a cup of tea (complimentary) and cake. You can buy good quality tea. Fantastic view. For centuries known as Mackwood Labookellie Tea Estate, the name of the tea estate has been changed to Damro Tea Estate recently on transfer of the estate to the Damro business group. The showroom is located in situ at Labookellie Tea Estate right on the main road from Kandy to Newerelia. The huge bill boards near the entrance are helpful to easily  locate the show room. The showroom has been extensively renovated with ample parking space and comfortable seating area. The top quality of the original Mackwood Labookellie Tea Estate is still maintained. The visitors are given free tea tasting of the single estate tea from the estate. The quality of tea is very good and the prices are quite reasonable. Visitors from India can consider taking many packets of Indian sweets like Son Papdi which is in huge demand by the sales executives at the showroom. The sales executives are polite, smiling and neatly dressed in traditional Sri Lankan attire. Highly recommended for the conoseuers of authentic single estate Sri Lankan tea. It’s a money factory. We arrive and it’s full of people waiting to be integrated in a group to go to see the tea fabrication process. We where with a small group with a very professional lady that explain and the steps to make the tea, it’s like 25 minutes and it’s done. After the send u to try the tea, only one kind is a available and we don’t even try because no table was available. If u are going expecting to have the experience of see how the ladies collect the tea you can do it but it’s 70€ per person for one your. Quite disappointing This tea farm is certainly a tourist attraction with European prices when it comes to buying tea. Yet it is absolutely worth the experience: the scenery is breath-taking, the small tour is super interesting, you can pluck some tea yourself of the tea plants or simply just take beautiful pictures and enjoy the vibes. Being so high in altitude certainly adds to the beautiful landscapes. You can try different teas and also buy for home. Yes,it is overpriced when it comes to the premium options, but the rest was pretty ok. Total duration of the visit with some tea drinking is 60-80 minutes A great place to visit.  I was part of a tour. The lovely lady that showed us around had perfect English so was easy to understand   It is amazing to learn about the drying process etc kept to very precise timing   Also fun to have a go at picking the tea leaves   Highly recommend as something a little different I don't know, what happend to the place, but it was ABSOLUTE waste of time.. A company guide rushed a group of us through the factory (like 5' tour) Then we were shown the area where all different teas were available for sale. I asked the guide nicely, if we can get some more information and even see the plantation and other staff, she told us they are busy, but she can give us the tour again, we saw they are not busy, so we told her, we can see they are not busy, so she told us it is not safe to go to the field, it was raining and it's not safe (it was not raining for a week). So we got the feeling they don't care about anything else then sales, so we left very dissapointed. It's not worth of visit at all! There is a large decking viewing area at this establishment.. Where you can look at the rows of tea bushes, under it you will find the poor locals, begging for you to throw a few notes over the handrail of the decking. You only find out information once you actually leave and the guide explains more. The tour felt quite rushed, and with the group size it was difficult to hear the guide clearly, which took away from the experience. While the factory visit was interesting, it was shorter than expected. At the end, only one type of tea was offered for tasting, it would have been much better to sample a variety of teas, especially given Sri Lanka’s rich tea heritage. The scenery is beautiful, but the overall experience could be improved with a slower, more engaging tour and a broader tea tasting. Great place if you want to see how tea is made. You get a free tour and free tea sample. Very nice staff and tasty tea. The views make for some good photos too. We stopped here while going to Nuwaraeliya. Nice place to have a cup of tea  and cake. You can buy good quality tea. Fantastic view. I have visited this place several times with my family, but this time we decided to take a tea plantation tour. This was the day that I learned a lot about tea and tea pickers' lives. That was so interesting and made me to explore more about Sri Lanka tea. When we visited (weekends are generally more crowded), the general tea shop was too cramped and we decided to visit their (adjoining) new wing/tea shop with more space and comfortable seating. Found out that they charge a fee of LKR 1,500 for a package that includes a piece of cake, a cup of tea, two packets of tea leaves and a private tour of the tea factory. Thought it was reasonable and our server (Prabhu) was excellent, a young man relatively new to the place but very attentive and had a high level of enthusiasm about the work. Recommend for people who are interested in learning about tea processing and varieties of tea, also buy good quality teas. We had a very extensive & informative tour of the tea factory & our guide explained it exceptionally well! Damro was the first tea factory we visited in Sri Lanka. It was recommended by several tuktuk drivers and our homestay host. The tour was complimentary and lasted about 20 minutes, as we walked through the factory. We visited on New Year so there were no leaves being blow-dried. Our guide looked tired and recited off a script. She did nonetheless entertain our pesky questions well. After the tour we got to taste a cup each of FF1 tea in the lounge, but sadly we weren’t particularly impressed. Strangely, there wasn’t the option to try other types of tea - we would have wanted to try the loose leaf types like OP and BOP which we later discovered were more to our liking. We were, funnily enough, allowed to buy cakes, which admittedly were cheap and decent. Ultimately, as we had liked our host’s tea, which was from damro, we proceeded to make the mistake of buying too much tea on our first stop. It was only after visiting the Mackwoods museum in Nuwara Eliya’s city centre that we found out more about the history of Damro - it was a furniture company that had just (as of 2016) ventured into the plantation business, acquiring great swathes of land, including the Labookellie tea lounge, and a significant stake in the Mackwoods brand (the second oldest tea company after the parent company of Lipton). Make what you will of our experience - we still can’t figure out if we are happy with our purchases 4 days later. But the experience as a whole was somewhat uncanny. The price of tea in the gift shop we found to be average - higher than the Zesta / Lipton types in supermarkets but lower than most single-estate tea companies we visited elsewhere in Sri Lanka. Our advice would be to stay off the teabags (which we tasted and found to be quite ordinary) and stick to the loose leaf teas. Was a nice tour, wasn’t that long - was more like a selling pitch but the views were amazing, the inside of the factory was okay, the shop was nice. Complimentary tea was good too. Glad we visited as was in the area not sure I’d go out my way completely! As we wanted to visit a tea plantation, our driver suggested we stop off here en route from Nuwara Eliya to Kandy. On arrival, we were met by one of the guides who took us for a tour of the tea factory and explained to us the process of how tea is produced and ends up in our cups. As my husband and I are key tea drinkers, we found it very informative to listen and see the process happen. At the end of the tour, we enjoyed a cup of Damro tea and bought our favourites from the shop; a nice take home for us and the family. It was a pleasant as well interesting tour of the tea estate. The guidie explained in detail the process of tea leaves and tea making. The view of the tea estate was great. Also, the tea cake was delicious and went well with the complimentary tea. This is a great place to visit and learn about tea. As far as tea factories go I think Damro is the better option. Found it to have more scenic surrounds and the staff were more authentic and professional. Enjoyed a cup of tea and the famous tea cake after the tour. Tour was less than 20-minutes as a solo traveller. After a drive up the steep mountain road, there is plenty of parking at the factory tour. Welcome with sanitation station and then around the factory & building with our personal tour guide. At the end of tour a big seating area inside or outside, where tea is provided and cake of course! Well worth a visit 50,000LKR was taken out of my wallet during safari tea tour organised by Damro tea factory. My husband and I left the jeep for 5 min to pick tea leaves and take pictures and we were told to leave my handbag in the jeep. Big mistake! The Damro jeep driver helped himself and denied it when we spoke to the management who ignored us. Very bad service, DO NOT VISIT THIS FACTORY Lovely stop off to Nuwara Eliya with excellent tea service and the opportunity to buy tea gifts. Well worth visiting If you want to visit a tea factory, this one has it all. Clean restrooms, informative tour, tea room and ability to buy great teas. There is no charge for the short 15 minute very professional description of the tea harvesting and factory processes while walking through the factory. For safety reasons, unlike some where you walk past moving machinery, this was conducted on walkways behind glazed views. And then into the tea rooms for a complimentary cup, very pleasant. Perhaps the whole structure and operation is a little too modern and clinically presented for some, and while there are hills of tea bushes around the factory and a modern tea room they are not the most photogenic. This was an underwhelming and time wasting experience. Don’t spend your travel time budget on this one. My Sri Lankan partner and I (aka the foreigner) visited for a tea tour. After a 15 min wait for the guide we went on a tour that took 15 mins at most. We listened to some scripted information about tea and found ourselves seated next to the shop with a promise of a cup of tea and an invitation to buy. No discussion, no questions invited, no explanation of why the ‘tour’ did not hit advertised targets. A guy quickly poured tea and was gone. No explanation; I don’t know what we drank. Boxes of tea were about $50. We left and spoke to a local guide. He said that he’d overheard staff say it was busy so they should cut our group quickly and get onto the next one. He reported complaints from multiple customers of his. He also said that foreigners get free entry because they’re likely to buy stuff at the shop. Locals get charged entry because they’re considered less likely to spend at the shop. We didn’t pay.  I’d say they need an overhaul of their customer treatment practices. Nearby is Pedro which has a good reputation, although I did not visit. Heritage tea factory I did visit. We plucked tea leaves in the grounds, walked through a processing plant, had lots of Q and A, then had tea tasting of four kinds of tea. Winner. I was taken to this tea factory as part of a tour. The lady explained about the different types of tea being manufactured and processed in the factory. Historically, Indian labour was brought by the British to work in the tea plantations. Now there are the same families third fourth generation labour still working there. They have been exploited quite badly. The tea processed is auctioned by the government and then bought by big manufacturers who blend the tea to make it cheaper. The factory was empty when I went but they do serve a nice cup of tea and there is a shop on the premises. Beautiful tea garden and great tour The cafe is lovely where you can enjoy a selection of the teas and they have great chocolate cake The views from the factory are amazing, you can witness tea picking right in front of you The factory tour we had was brilliant The lady who took us around was so knowledgeable and really explained the whole Process I am so much more grateful for my tea now! Very interesting and a very knowledgeable guide. We loved hearing and seeing the process followed by nice cup of tea in the guest room. Even the shop is very well priced and it even makes the royal family’s personal tea.",3.9,264,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/32/41/e1/c9/tea-time.jpg?w=700&h=400&s=1,0.0,35.294117647058826,7.6923076923076925,1.3574660633484164,11.76470588235294,43.89140271493213
Dehiwala Zoo Sri Lanka,"Dehiwala Zoo Sri Lanka. Thought we would give the zoo a try. About £10 per person for tourists which was ok. Quite an easy route to follow around . A reasonable array of animals but can’t say I felt comfortable seeing some of them in small areas for their size, eg Tigers, bears . Keepers made a point of letting tourists feed animals , nice touch. Lots of signs saying don’t throw rubbish! Waste of time given the amount rubbish we saw all over and in enclosures. Overall we found it pretty grubby and far too cramped for a good few animals of the larger variety. A very run down zoo. Our Trip to the Zoo was great, the Uber was able to drop us off directly infront of the main entrance of the zoo, I will caution it is a busy tight street with no sidewalks so if you are bringing your children,  be mindful of the vehicles. There are 3 different prices, Local, Tourist, and another that was less than Tourist but more than Visitor. If you have a Diplomatic ID you will get the local price which is 200LKR vs. The 4000LKR tourist price. The entrance line was hectic, and you had to stand your ground when people tried to cut, but it was very quick to get through (we went around 3 hrs before closing) As we walked around the animals were actually out and present which is a nice change from past experiences at other zoos. A Zoo employee offered us a guided tour, moving us around crowds providing us front views of the animals, and carried snacks and plants that he handed us to feed the animals. There was no agreed upon price for this tour, at the end it was simply put ""if you were happy with your experience please tip what youd like"" During the walk around another employer added himself onto our tour and also asked for tip, I tipped him less because I knew what the deal was but wanted to be appreciative of the assistance.  Although I am sure we were targeted for this guided tour because we were American, it honestly made my kids day and felt like VIP treatment, so I did not mind at all. We were able to get up close and Personal with both the Elephants and thw Giraffes and feed and touch them both. So I actually recommend the tour. It was hot so I suggest bringing water and a fan. But there are refreshment vendors on the path. Well I can not recommend this place, because of very high entrance rates for foreigners ! Again and again it shows how Sri Lanka despises tourists in their country. Rates for tourist are nearly 20 x higher than for local people , please never go there ! Prejudice and economic racisme is rampant in that country ! Had a wonderful time at Dehiwala Zoo! The variety of animals was impressive, and the grounds were clean and well-maintained. It’s a peaceful place to walk around and a great spot for families and kids. The animal enclosures are spacious, and the staff were friendly and helpful. The aquarium and reptile sections were especially interesting. Highly recommended for a fun and educational outing near Colombo! The Dehiwela Zoo is a fantastic day out for all ages!  I was impressed by the spacious enclosures and the obvious care taken with the animals.  The variety of species is remarkable, from majestic elephants to playful primates.  The bird show was a highlight, showcasing vibrant colours and impressive skills.  The zoo's layout is easy to navigate, and there are plenty of food stalls and rest areas.  A truly enjoyable and educational experience, I highly recommend a visit to the Dehiwela Zoo! Well experienced place to watch animals in a zoo and got lot of knowledge about animal world. Recommended for children to come and visit. Good few hours with family. Fed elephants there and went to eat delicious vag food at the end. Good experience overall.. This zoo should be closed. Terrible conditions for the animals. Small cages, distressed animals and some had no shadows for the sun. Please, dont contribute to keep this place open. They charge a lot more for foreigners than locals, but it does not justify the horrible life of the animals. The zoo is home to a wide variety of animals, from majestic elephants to playful monkeys and colorful birds. The enclosures are well-maintained, and the animals appear healthy and well-cared for. One of the highlights was the elephant show, where we got to see these gentle giants up close, showcasing their intelligence and strength. The zoo also has a beautiful butterfly garden that was a peaceful retreat amid the excitement of the day. The staff were friendly and knowledgeable, always ready to answer questions and provide interesting facts about the animals. It’s clear they care deeply about conservation and educating the public. While the zoo can get busy, especially on weekends, there are plenty of shaded areas to relax and enjoy a picnic. The kids particularly loved the reptile house and the chance to feed some of the animals. Overall, Dehiwala Zoo offers a fun and educational experience for families and animal lovers alike. It's a great way to spend a day, especially if you're looking to learn more about wildlife in Sri Lanka. Highly recommend a visit if you're in the Colombo area! #ExploreSriLanka #ScenicLankaPersonalTourDrivers We went dahiwala zoo it was nice place varites of animals .i love elephant dance they have train so well but some of spaces are small to them but we watch and enjoy good place for kids to visit I am very happy with the day that was spent. It is very valuable to have information boards displayed everywhere. I went here for the first time.. Some of the animals seemed to be sick. Very sad to see them. The bird park is very beautiful. There are many things to learn about animals. You can also learn about trees. All animals look sad and depressed . The upkeep of the snakes and the bear is extremely saddening . The tigers look disoriented. The space allotted for these majestic creatures is really small. In my opinion all zoos should be shut no matter where they are . The poor animals do not deserve a life of this sort . My advise to tourists pls do not go to any zoo.. The humid Sri Lankan air clung to me as I entered the Dehiwela Zoo. As a traveler with a penchant for wildlife, this was a must-visit on my Sri Lankan itinerary. Stepping through the gates, the cacophony of animal calls replaced the city's honking symphony. My first stop was the elephant enclosure. These gentle giants, Sri Lanka's national treasure, were munching on hay. A sense of awe washed over me as I observed their wrinkled grey skin and intelligent eyes.  A young elephant playfully sprayed itself with water from its trunk, a gesture that made me chuckle. Next, the playful chatter of monkeys drew me in. The Sri Lanka Langurs, with their distinctive black faces, swung from branch to branch, seemingly unfazed by the watching crowd.  A troop of macaques squabbled over a fallen banana, their antics providing a moment of amusement. The roar of a lion echoed through the zoo, sending shivers down my spine.  Approaching the lion enclosure with a mix of anticipation and trepidation, I saw the majestic creature lounging in the shade. Its golden mane shimmered in the sunlight, and its powerful presence commanded respect. The Dehiwela Zoo isn't just about the big cats. I wandered past enclosures housing a variety of fascinating creatures, each with its own unique story.  The graceful peacocks strutted their vibrant feathers, the zebras grazed peacefully, and the giraffes stretched their long necks, offering a glimpse into their leafy breakfast. One of the highlights was the feeding time at the hippopotamus enclosure. These enormous creatures lumbered out of the water, eagerly awaiting their meal.  It was a sight that both impressed and slightly terrified me with their sheer size and powerful jaws. There are plenty of animals to see but sadly not in very good surroundings,just not enough space for the birds to fly and the large animals to move naturally…very sad.The cost of a ticket for a foreign adult was 17 us dollars.There are a couple of food vendors and a main indoor dining room…we spent around 2 hours there but could have done it quicker. This was one of the most horrendous animal experiences I’ve ever encountered. We went with family, who had in turn gone as children to this zoo - so it was a trip down memory lane for them. I was hoping there would be some element of care for the animals - after all, they advertise that you can see elephants, lions, bears, giraffes and more. I was incredibly shocked by what we saw. On arrival we learnt about the “World Children’s Day” event where staff proudly told us school kids are allowed to pet the lion cubs. I was shocked that anyone is allowed to handle the cubs - and can only image what is done to control the cubs in these circumstances (drugging, starvation, lack of water - all to control behaviour). Elephants are chained and poked into submission using ‘phaajaan’ and then made to parade, perform and “dance” - a tradition at this zoo dating back decades apparently. It’s disgusting to watch - much like the old circus activities that are Elephants balance on each other and form shapes. I was shocked at how many local people come here to cheer and champion this treatment, without any care for the treatment of the animals. I would have thought people are more educated about this in 2024 and should know how cruel this is! The worst thing was that there is no acknowledgement of how wrong it is to treat any animals this way. They are blatantly tortured and exploited for human entertainment - and tamed into submission in ways we all know are cruel. Yet people pay to see this. While this might be down to a lack of local education, I suspect that’s not the case in this day and age - rather that, at Dehiwala Zoo, making money is far more important than animal welfare. This zoo should be shut down, and I hope other travellers can help share this message so people do not spend their money here in future. Well I can not recommend this place, because of very high entrance rates for foreigners ! Again and again it shows how Sri Lanka despises tourists in their country. Rates for tourist are nearly 20 x higher than for local people , please never go there ! Prejudice and economic racisme is rampant in that country ! I visited this zoo 5 years ago (visited before too being Sri Lankan born) and had a good experience as it had just been renovated. This visit today was a total disappointment. So sad to see the neglect of the zoo compared to 5 years ago. Sri Lanka sadly has a bad record of maintaining anything new which belongs to the government, they run it down as seen even on the first class carriages of the trains! Animals were suffering, not given adequate facilities to suit their living environment. Lack of water for water bathing animals such as elephants, hypo’s, bears etc. animal cruelty is at its best at this zoo, will never go there again on my future visits to the country! This is my second time they have improved a lot.. Kids had a great time .will visit again for sure.. Better to i the morning .. Since I visited the zoo on a day off, which also coincided with the day of the full moon, then, as you may have guessed, there were a countless number of people at the ticket office. But, lo and behold, a local woman came up and took me to the cash register. It turned out that “whites” were allowed in without a queue. The ticket price at that time (January 2023) was 3000 rupees. Now the price on the official website is $15. But payment is accepted only in local currency. Established in 1936, Dehiwala Zoo is one of the oldest zoos in Asia. It is located in the suburbs, just a few minutes' drive from the center of Colombo. The zoo is home to more than 300 different species of animals, birds, reptiles and fish from around the world. The animals live in large enclosures and are well cared for. The animals look healthy. I really liked the park's navigation. If you follow the signs, you will definitely not miss anything. And the territory of the zoo is not small. In addition to the main enclosures, there is a reptile corner, an aquarium, a “Bird House” and a “Butterfly Garden”. Unfortunately, the Butterfly Garden was not open on the day of my visit. All cages have a small sign with detailed information about the animal being kept in the cage, making a visit to the zoo very educational. Also at certain times (it is indicated on the back of the tickets) feeding of different animals takes place. For an additional fee, you can feed giraffes, pelicans, parrots and other birds yourself. And in a special arena with an amphitheater you can see the “Elephant Show”. I didn’t make it to the beginning because I didn’t calculate the time and was delayed at the other end of the zoo. Don't make the same mistakes I did if you want to watch the whole show. ) If you get hungry during or after your walk, at the entrance you will find sellers of street food and cotton candy. There are several kiosks throughout the zoo where you can buy drinks and snacks. There are many benches and gazebos in the park where you can sit down to rest, have a snack or hide from the rain. It is better to visit on weekdays when there are fewer people. Wonderful experience walking around the zoo, we didn't expect it to be big, but it turned out to be huge! You can easily spend up to 5 or 6 hours here! Saw a few animals that I wasn't expecting to see here, but it was a pleasant surprise. I first visited the zoo about thirty five years ago when the only thing I enjoyed was the flora. The animals at that time were poorly housed with very poor attention to the weather of some of the larger mammals. On my visit in March 2023 this was no longer the case . The animals looked well cared for and the visit was an enjoyable experience . I feel that the zoo now has an important function in educating and encouraging future generations to look after habitats in our own environments. The flora was once more a joy to behold. One of the nice places to visit in Sri Lanka. Specially with kids. It takes avg. 4 hrs to visit whole animals inside the zoo. I have visited this place many times. Its very encouraging to see more space allocated for the animals. Definitely a place to visit. This is definitely a place to visit in Sri Lanka. Glad to see the authorities giving more space for the animals. This was my 8th time during last 50 years!  Lot improved so far.  but less animals and more people  Some new cages are getting ready.  I usually go with tourists and their rates are up now, way up.  Reasonable for locals.  In the middle of city you can relax, enjoy the shady garden and watch animals from all around the world.  The big disappointment is main restaurant does not serve rice and curry, only foreign food for visiting locals!  This should be a good place to promote, introduce Sri Lankan food not chinsed food!!  Another place has rice and curry, but very limited, and we waited in the line for a long time that guy served others with take away and ignored us, so we left!  That place was not so clean, broken furniture, dirty floor, left over food on the tables, not even good for the locals, mainly for Zoo workers. National Zoological Gardens of Sri Lanka is a zoological garden in Dehiwala, Sri Lanka, founded in 1936. Its sprawling areas are host to a variety of animals and birds. The zoo exhibits animals but also places an emphasis on animal conservation and welfare, and education. It’s been 3 years since the last time I visited the Dehiwala Zoo and it was me and husband only when we are still a couple. Before it was too crowded when this covid-19 didn’t hit the country. Me and my family especially my 2 yr. old daughter enjoyed the sightseeing of each animals. I loved how they added some attractions like the museum, butterfly farm and the birds cage place. Since it’s the biggest zoo in Sri Lanka, it will take you sometime to see all the animals and you should ready your hat, water everything that can cover you up since it’s a very long walk. I hope that they maintain the place how it is where the animals will feel comfortable and especially continue to take care of the them(animals). Overall, we enjoyed the walk just a little smell is there but it’s kinda normal since it’s a zoo and it’s full of animals. Large zoo, very cheap entrance and cheap snacks and ice cream stalls in abundance. So many animals to see for little ones including komodo dragon. Lovely playground inside. Great place to spend the day with young kids and nature enthusiastic teens Very large area to cover so get ready to walk.. they have buggies (at a fee) for those who cannot walk much Weekends can be crowded with locals Make sure you have a cap and sunglasses And hand sanitizer .. you can touch some smaller animals The place is clean .. does not smell bad Many food outlets inside If your there on a Sunday make sure you watch the elephant show The open birds atrium is amazing.. The negatives are just outside the entrance.. watch out for hawkers Do not take tuktuks (expensive) from the entrance better to install pickme app and order cabs online Lovely place to spend a morning there, watching animal eating in the morning time. It is very nice that to same animals you can get really close. There are a small aquarium, a reptile ace, a butterfly place. It is very nice. Its one of the largest zoo's i have seen in Srilanka. It has the name boards around 45 locations inside the zoo were the animals are kept. It has a separate parking for the vehicles. It has an restaurant and few eatery options in between the pathway. Owl's is one of the top attractions found specially in Srilanka. It takes around minimum 3-4 hours to cover up the entire park and will be good fun ride for the kids. Nice experience for us. My son was very happy with the garden and the animals. Its the first experience for him Not the best experience. Animals seemed to be well maintained. Layout was a bit confusing. The butterfly garden was very limited and not as advertised. Foreigners are overcharged at the entrance (Lkr 3000) for adult. Detailed Information was provided for some of the animals. Sri Lanka national zoological garden is a famous attractive place In Colombo.it is good place to visit with friends and family.also with new development in zoo park there are so many new things and pieces added. Best time to travel in early in the morning or evening. Weekend night life educational journey also happening. As a family we visited the National Zoological Gardens of Sri Lanka and enjoyed the new setting very much as it gives much freedom to the animals and better experience to the visitors. Buddus are the beings who are bellow intellect. Animals, Birds, Reptiles, Fish are some of them. Buddus is a Sanskrit language name. Some of our human beings are also having Animal qualities. You can meet all of them here. It is the Zoo in Dehiwala town in Colombo, Sri Lanka I have been there so many times. the renovations are almost done. good to see the animals are well looked after now. the new entrance and the new bird area is fantastic. hope the people will take care of the place. need more animals . Can get crowded in weekends, public holidays and school vacation. Best to visit on a weekday. A rare collection of endemic birds and mammals. Can’t believe people from the affluent wealthy West complain about paying higher admission fees than local residents! It’s worth the admission tommeander gently through this wonderfully maintained and extensive site. Green, luscious and full with  wonderfull trees of great  age and beauty, cafes and refreshments available - or take a picnic. Two,or three hours of sheer delight and wonder. Best place in Colombo. Nice place. Family entertaining place. Children's enjoy place. 60 Type of animals including this zoology garden. Just only entry ticket 20/= (srilanka people) This is my 3rd trip in 8 years and the last trip in September 2018 was very good. Earlier 2 visits the zoo was pretty smelly and unclean most of the areas. But they have fully refurbished the attractions with many improvements such as night safari, glass walls in some enclosures, new open elephant enclosure where elephants are free to walk, new animals such as hippos, helpful route maps, feeding animals etc. definitely suggest to take the night safari which had to pay extra for the buggy ride but fair charge. A great range of birds, animals, reptiles. In good clean grounds. A long walk if you see everything. Would of got 5 stars except for the expensive entry fee , 2500 rupees for non Sri Lankans (only 100 rupees for locals). This Zoo was the biggest in Asia and now part of it has been shifted to Pinnawala as an open zoo. Those days we had seals penguins etc but now not so wide a variety but still a large aquarium, butterfly garden, snake garden etc and many species of wild life from around the orld. Visited the zoo by night, was quite nice and really enjoyed the tiger and lion exhibition. We also were able to travel around through a buggy cart with a guide which was very informative. Its great to see that they promote the nocturnal animals as well while not disturbing the rest. A nice place to spend the day. The animals are beautiful. I love the exotic birds on the trees.and I always wait for the elephant dane. make sue you check the times. I highly recommend that all tourists in Colombo should visit this Zoo. It needs 2.5 - 5 Hours to go thru the whole zoo.",3.9,55,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/c4/fc/3f/wild-cat.jpg?w=700&h=400&s=1,2.1739130434782608,23.91304347826087,8.695652173913043,0.0,15.217391304347828,50.0
Devil_s_Staircase,"Devil_s_Staircase. Devil’s Staircase, from Horton Plains down to Bambarakanda waterfall (the country’s tallest), is one of the best hikes you can do in Sri Lanka’s glorious tea country.  We took an early train to Ohiya and walked up the quiet road from the station to the trailhead.  Devil’s Staircase initially shares its path with stage 11 of the Pekoe Trail (orange markers) but then turns right across a stream to continue its descent.  Bambarakanda waterfall becomes visible towards the end of the trail, where there are several small cafés.  It is then a further 5km to the main road at Kalupahana, where it is easy to catch a bus. I went through this road by foot up to Bambarakanda three times. We can see nice veiw up to Hambanthota ariea just like a graphical picture. Climet is soo soothing and make our minds lost inside this natural beauty. I have my best memories on this road keeps repating in my mind every time. I went through this road by foot up to Bambarakanda three times. We can see nice veiw up to Hambanthota ariea just like a graphical picture. Climet is soo soothing and make our minds lost inside this natural beauty. I have my best memories on this road keeps repating in my mind every time. Adventurous joyful travel that one can take with friends or family either on a suitable vehicle or on walk for over 20 kms if you cross to the other side adventure hiking experience.when hiking along the mountain, it was actually attractive! 💯Seeing scenic beauty of soround mountains ,you can get amazing feeling waking along the  road along the mountain 🏔!in the morning at top of the mountain ,the soround area is absolutely attractive! This view is with beautiful cloud of fog and invasive sunlight!you can take 💯 fresh air!  Get this feeling 😍 🔴While you are riding the bike at the top of mountain,Be careful! Some places at the mountain, no signal connection! ⚠️Don't waste the environment! Great place to do camping around Devil’s staircase road to Ohoya in Kalupahana. Bit there is a huge wind fall and we have to seek best place to cover from wind. But there is a grate view from there of mountain and sky in night. It’s was a lovely experience... Difficult but worth the effort... 10 hours, 22km , 27k steps , 4k calories.... I really enjoyed it. We took the most difficult route not the 4x4 route which is the most beautiful route... you need have a proper guide and hiking shoes and other stuff... I took this trail from Ohiya Road to Kalupahana. For a moment i thought that i am lost. Hardly anyone there to get direction unless you carry a phone with GPS. I did this on my dual sports motorcycle. Also i am planning to do this trail on the same motorcycle from the other end. Kalupahana to Ohiya and from Ohiya to nuwara Eliya via Horton Plains. I am planning to camp at Devils Stair camping site. Anyone interested can join me in October. Also there are jeeps on both ends for weaker travelers. On the way you will see the highest waterfall of Sri Lanka (Bambarakanda Fall). The scenery is amazing. Some hikers to this trail by foot and some do cycle the whole trail on mountain bikes. It is worth for travelers looking for adventure. Very beautiful mist way with adventure hikking expirience also always with you.you can get a great snaps always that steps. Actually, we did not had any idea about this road, we just took this road since the google map shows this as the shortest way to go to Hortain plains from Bambarakanda. Our car was not a 4-WD, but we had to go since we took this road. wow the scenery is breathtaking. I know we took a risk but still we do not regret because that way was amazing. But, If you have a 4-WD vehicle nothing to scare you can go without any matter. Should take this route. Good experience. I booked a 4x4 and started off from the Bambarakanda side in the in the morning right after the sunrise. after the first few Km's i came across many amazing view points and was truly lost in Nature bliss. there were many other hikers and bikers and it was an amazing experience going through narrow roads, meeting local people who live in the mountains and not to forget the scenery you come across in every corner. it took us around 3-4 hours to cover the whole route up to Ohiya in the 4x4 and the ride wasn't easy at all. it was very bumpy throughout the ride but well worth it. you could even do this vise-versa starting from Ohiya railway station. you could spend one night at Bambarakanda guest house and start off from there early morning if going by foot. You can start the hike from the Ohiya Railway station. Take the night mail from Colombo Fort and you can reach Ohiya at about 5a.m  The environment is very very beautiful and the cold weather in the morning will make goosebumps. The hike is about 23km and you will enjoy the journey since it has so many places to snap beautiful photos. You can visit the Bambarakanda falls which is the highest waterfall in the country on your way. you can end the hike from Kalupahana and get the bus from Badulla to Colombo (99) Very beautiful way with adventure hikking expirience also always with you.you can get a great snaps always that steps. It is the longest hike and wonderful journey for me by walk. I went with few frinds via Ohiya Hortain plains entrance and Udaweriya estate. It's not a rainy day and mountain view is suprb . The highest waterfall of Sri Lanka is Bambarakanda fall and we climb down from top to bottom of fall through forest. And we saw upper fall and lower fall on the way. Just take the train to Ohiya and trek along the Hatton road to the Udaweriya Estate and trek along the gravel road to the Kalupahana past the highest waterfall in Sri Lanka. This trek affords magnificent views of the nearby mountains and tea estates. There are 04 waterfalls along the road to visit if you've time. The hike may take an entire day. Alternatively, you can stay in Bambarakanda area and continue the hike next day to Kalupahana This place is just like a path to a hidden world. Tiring journey but worth experiencing. Use your feet rather than on wheels, that will make you more close to the nature and scenic beauty of the hill country. The path is very risky and should go walking or if you are on a vehicle, it MUST be a goo 4 wheel drive. A Jeep is preferred. No SUV is recommended. The environment is pretty much beautiful. Always check weather before going and be ready for some rain. I was involved on a test run on this road. The road up to the top of the Bambarakanda kanda falls has been bone up. But the road thereafter is broken and not motorable. The view from the top is spectacular. I had done a hike from Ohiya station to World's end but the Bambarakanda route is much better. I had heard about the Devil's Staircase road and was advised not to ride it on a road-motorcycle. It was more suited for a trail bike or a 4WD vehicle. But I ventured on that track with a group of Indian, Australian and New Zealand riders on Royal Enfield motorcycles. The track through the Udaveriya Tea Estate was just a never-ending ride over rocks of different sizes. It took us almost 5 hours to cover less than 9 kilometres! I was happy that I did that ride, and finished unscathed, but I won't do it again on a motorcycle. That was one hell of an adventure. However, the views and scenery were absolutely fantastic. Started the walk from Hill Safari Eco Lodge, Ohiya. Mr. Eomal Perera, the owner is a kind gentleman who has a wealth of knowledge about the area. Take a 1L water bottle, snacks, a cap, shades, sunblock, a hiking staff (if you have one), wear good walking shoes, umbrella/ raincoat. If you take a short cut from Hill Safari through the villages and down foot paths among the vegetable gardens, the walk will take 4hrs max. If you walk along the main road above Hill Safari passing the 2 silent factories (Ohiya & Udaveriya) it will take about 5+ hrs. Start the walk early, even 6am when the sun is coming up. The scenery is spectacular. Take time to talk to the locals, they are friendly & like to interact with hikers. We took the kids some socks which was much appreciated. If you can, take them something small like pens, socks, Tamil Story books etc. They ask for sweets or biscuits! Two dogs befriended us separately & led us through many foot paths, which was very entertaining! They just want some food if you have any. You need a 4WD or a bike to travel on this road. But personally, I prefer to walk. There is a safari jeep which takes tourists on this road for Rs. 10,000 for 6 pax. My 2nd time on this hike & will do it again in a few years time. This is the road connecting Ohiya and Bambarakanda. The road it self like a staircase. That's why it got the name. You cannot go here without a four wheel drive vehicle. Or else, walk. This is the second time I went on this trial and this time we came down by foot from Ohiya to Bambarakanda Waterfall.. It took over 8 hours for four of us to reach Bambarakanda from Ohiya Railway station, because we stopped at many places to capture the beauty of the nature. During last couple of kilometers, it rained heavily, caused to slower our journey, but it was a wonderful experience walking during rain. (We were prepared for rain and all of us bought rain coats) We took some sweets with us for the little ones in those villages and I suggest for ones who are planning to experience this trial... Most of those children were so underprivileged and not seen the outside world than their small village... Absolutely, it was a great 'Walk to Remember'...!!! Started the trip from Kalupahana, Bambarakanda fall. Started around 7am from Bambarakanda holiday resort. It's about 20 plus Km to Bambarakanda to Ohiya. You can travel either by foot or vehicle. If you can't get overly tired a vehicle would be the best option.its nearly 4 hours by the jeep for us since we took a lot of photos.there are no shops so better bring some snacks and water. No washrooms as well. Road is challenging to drive, need good ground clearance vehicle and be careful with sharp stones that can damage tires. You will pass small village isolated in the path. Take some sweets for children if possible. Villagers are humble and innocent. Greet them when passing. The view from start to end is amazing. No words to describe it. Mind blowing I must say. Please don't put any plastic waste or anything that you bought which could harm the beauty of it.Leave it as it is. Leave only foot prints. Scenic road leads for about 23 kms from Kalupahana to Ohiya. The road condition is very bad, which is the so much unique about this trip. Highly recomand  for true natute lovers.Ideal to get a true 4×4 experiance. However it is manageable by motorbikes or by foot also. This was the one most picturesque routes that I've traveled. The views were breathtaking and the journey was exhilarating. Bambarakanda falls was one of the several highlights of the journey. The smaller cascades, along with the flora and fauna make you stare at them in awe. This was one of the best experiences in my life. Some Tips: If you chose to travel on foot, make sure you keep yourself hydrated and energized. You can take shortcuts to reduce the length of the journey. The downside here is that their slopes are steeper and you might miss some good sceneries. Travel light and don't eat heavy food before or during the journey. We saw this place in social media and decided to experience the trial. This road is running from Kalupahana to Ohiya (near to Horton Plains National Park) passing Bambarakanda Waterfall and is the shortest route from Balangoda/Belihuloya side to Ohiya. We used two 4WD jeeps and Full trial was around 23kms. This runs over the waterfall and had to go through the water path of the fall. Views from the beginning to end were stunning and amazing...!!! There were many hard bends and paths all over, and the trail was extremely challenging...!!! We met and passed  many, who walked through this trail from Ohiya Railway station to Bambarakanda and Kalupahana... It was a very special and great experience, and highly recommend for everyone to try at least once in a lifetime... You can drive 23 Km's through this wonderful passage if you have a 4x4 vehicle. You get this road when you climb to Horton place from the bottom of the worlds end (Non periel ) The breathtaking views will forget your sorrowsw😊 Get in to the ohiya station by a train and walk down through the devils staircase to babarakanda fall. It was a amazing walk ! Journey would be better if you go by a trail bike. If you are physically strong walk with open eyes to capture the nature. @the end you can have a natural water bath from Sri Lankan highest water fall. Nice and amazing mother earth.its the one of the amazing place in sri lanka.can cme to this place frm bambarakanda udaweriya line or frm ohiya railway station It is a memorable journey..you need a 4wheel cab to pass this.by foot theres 20 km.nice seens..no words to say.. This is a must go... located in hill country in Sri Lanka.. we had the best time with my friends and there family..try to get there early in the day. need a good vehicle.. 4 wheel driver is most suitable.but still other vehicles can do.. We started from Nanuoya Then pattipola world's end Ohiya Uduveriya Estate Devil's staircase Bambarakanda falls Kalupahana Junction It's a amazing nature trail But please be extremely careful while driving your four wheel drive vehicle Roads are tremendously adventurous and off road type We could not find a 4WD to do this stretch of the road, therefore we decided to walk the 15Kms. We were accompanied by a trekker from an outbound travel company, but on hind sight he was not required. We started the walk at 7am, but should have started at 6am as it got quite hot and sunny towards 10am. The walk started from Hill Safari Eco Lodge, Ohiya and ended close to Bambarakanda Falls in Kalupahana. The scenery along the walk was breathtaking. We walked through tea gardens, vegetable home gardens, through remote villages, past silent tea factories, green grass, blue mountains in a distance, small streams culminating in a shallow pool etc. Take drinking water and a few snacks. The walk took about 4-5 hrs with many stops to admire the views. If possible, try to walk up to the top of Bambarakanda Falls. It could be slippery with the pine needles coating the forest ground...but maybe worth a try. We didnt, because it could be risky and the possible leeches!",4.9,34,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/16/ef/3d/d9/nothing-but-mountains.jpg?w=700&h=400&s=1,0.0,18.75,9.375,0.0,50.0,21.875
Diyaluma Falls,"Diyaluma Falls. Diyaluma Falls was one of the best trips we did in Sri Lanka. We rode to the bottom of the falls from Ella ( about 1 hour on a motorbike) wondering if we would have to carry our jackets and helmets on the hike and where to safely park the bike.  We were lucky to be greeted by Saman who took care of everything. His guided hike to the waterfalls was great. He has so much knowledge of the forest, stopping along the way to show us different trees and plants. We spent several hours working our way down the different levels of the waterfall, swimming,  rock jumping and rock sliding. The views were breathtaking and we rated it as one of the best days out on our holiday. Saman’s number is +94787784560 Diyaluma Falls, Sri Lanka’s second-highest waterfall, is a breathtaking natural wonder near Ella. Cascading dramatically from lush green cliffs, it offers stunning views and refreshing natural pools at the top. A short hike rewards visitors with panoramic landscapes and peaceful surroundings. Ideal for nature lovers and adventure seekers, Diyaluma Falls is a perfect spot to swim, relax, and experience Sri Lanka’s raw beauty. The waterfalls are beautiful and the hike is very doable. You can drive (or be driven) quite high up toward the parking area, and from there it’s another 20–30 minutes uphill to reach the top of the falls. However, compared to the many other activities we’ve done in Sri Lanka so far, we found it quite busy at the waterfalls. Our tuk-tuk driver immediately became our guide, but in hindsight we regretted that a little. We were advised to take a guide so you know where to go after reaching the top, but in our experience you can easily figure this out yourself using Google Maps and by following other people. Our guide also seemed quite rushed, while you really want to spend a few hours relaxing in the natural infinity pools. Our advice: definitely go, but don’t take a guide, and make sure to give yourself enough time. Diyaluma Falls was one of the best things we did in Sri Lanka.  Well worth the drive off the main road.  Very manageable hike to get to the top of the falls and I highly recommend going early to beat the crowds.  We were there at 9am and it was perfect.  We also had the good fortune to have Saman as our guide.  His family lives at the base of the falls and he is the expert on safety and all the surrounding flora.  He made our day at the falls unforgettable!  Great communication and was waiting for us when we arrived.  His number is +94787784560 We had an incredible day at the falls with our 6 year old son. Our guide, Saman, was wonderful and definitely meant we got the most out of our trip. We found Saman’s number on other reviews here and text him when we were still in Udawalawe. He agreed to pick us up from our bus in Wellawaya, drive us all the way to the falls, guide us around and then drop us in Ella when we had finished. He offered a really good price for the day. Saman was so friendly and spoke good English. He arrived early to meet us and took us to his family kiosk at the base of the falls where we were able to leave our heavy bags and change our clothes. He gave our son a coconut and then we took the Tuk-tuk further up the hill. From there it was about a 20-30min walk to the falls. On the way Saman taught us all about the plants growing by the side of the trail. He picked lemongrass and cinnamon for us so we could smell them, showed us cashew trees and rubber that had solidified from rubber trees. Our son was fascinated by all his knowledge. Saman then led us to the highest pool where we were able to swim and skim stones. He showed us safe places to slide through the rocks into the water. There are tiny fish in the water that tickle as they nibble your feet. Further down the falls we were able to jump off a 10m ledge into a deep pool below. It was terrifying but absolutely worth it if you can summon the courage. It’s also a great spectator sport if you’re not up for it yourself! Even further down Saman went and found leaves like mini helicopters which he showed our son how to throw into the wind. The view from the top of the waterfall is breath-taking. We had our favourite day so far in Sri Lanka and this was all down to Saman and his brilliant knowledge. He was so kind with our little boy and made him feel really special and cared for. We had wondered if we needed a guide and it’s definitely possible to do it without one but we wouldn’t have had such an amazing experience if it weren’t for Saman. There are places to buy fruit and little restaurants all the way up and down for food. We spent about 3 hours there and the time flew by. 10/10 for this experience. On the way to Ella, Saman stopped and bought us hot corn on the cob from the roadside. It was delicious. Thank you Saman. If you want to get in touch his number is +94 (78) 778 4560 Visiting Diyaluma Falls was one of the most beautiful parts of our trip to Sri Lanka - so authentic and breathtaking! We did the guided hike to the top of the waterfall, which was not too difficult and offered amazing views all the way. At the top, we swam in the natural pools right next to the edge of the falls - such a unique and unforgettable experience. The place felt untouched and peaceful, far away from the crowds. After the hike, they also offer an optional shared lunch, which is a nice way to relax and enjoy local food with fellow travelers. The tour with our guide Saman was simply unforgettable! He led us to one of the most beautiful waterfalls and gave us a fascinating introduction to the native plant world along the way. We were able to get to know various spices such as pepper, cinnamon, pampero plant, gum and wild basil – a real experience for all the senses! Saman was particularly attentive and professional. In the places where we could jump into the water, he checked everything thoroughly beforehand to guarantee our safety. He also told us that with a bit of luck, elephants and leopards can also be seen during the hike through the jungle – which made the adventure even more exciting! An absolutely great tour that I can only recommend to anyone. Thank you, Saman! If you want to book a hike with him here his number: +94 714304910 Our trip to Diyaluma Falls was one of the absolute highlights of our journey through Sri Lanka – and we owe that to our amazing guide, Saman! He not only led us safely to the top but also showed us hidden natural pools and breathtaking viewpoints that we would never have found on our own. Saman knows exactly which pools are safe to swim in, where it’s best (and safest) to jump into the water, and where sliding down the rocks is the most fun. He is incredibly friendly, attentive, and knows the area like the back of his hand. Saman and his family also run a charming little kiosk right next to the waterfall. No one knows Diyaluma Falls better! We can wholeheartedly recommend him – if you want to truly experience the falls, go with Saman. Direct contact to Saman: +94 78 778 4560 (WhatsApp available) There is a small charge to enter at the Upper Falls now.  After seeing the upper falls and swimming in the natural pools, you will want to see the beauty from below, this huge waterfall is incredible from below, being the 2nd largest in Sri Lanka.  The upper part is a hike with stairs and we got a guide as it had been raining days prior and he was worth the payment as he added a lot to our enjoyment and assisted with photos and safe places to swim even with nibbly fish. These waterfalls are amazing, our guide was Diyaluma Guide Asanka ( you can get his details from google ) He meets you halfway up and then take you by tuk tuk some way further up. Then he shows you the best route to the falls, helps you navigate the rocks and takes great photos and videos of you in the water. I think this is near the top of things to see and do so far on our travels around Sri Lanka. Really lovely walk to top of these falls if you are sure footed, bathing was most fun where the locals were under the bigger falls (third? Pool down from top) but slippy so watch out. A fun activity with teens, just be wary of leeches, and have a king coconut as refreshment from one of the stalls on the way down The Diyaluma Fall is one of the most beautiful waterfalls I have ever seen. The hike there is super nice and exciting, as wild elephants are traveling here. The view from above of the countryside is fantastically beautiful. We can definitely recommend the hike to Diyaluma Fall. It's an amazing place, really. You must visit it Approximately 40 minutes drive from Ella town, this place is worth the visit. We drove to the waterfall and then paid for a guide who took us to the top of the waterfall (one-third of the way in Tuktuk and the rest on foot). You can swim up there and the view from the top is spectacular! It takes about thirty minutes and a small fee to access the top of the waterfall from the parking lot. This effort is largely rewarded: there are several pools in which to cool off. When we went there, there were quite a few other tourists but we were still quiet. Going down to the parking level, there are many restaurants to regain strength. We parked up our minivan and picked up our local guide who drove our group of 9 family and friends in a 4 wheel drive to the foot of the falls where there was a toilet and a snack shop. It was there we started our trek to the top. Although not a very difficult walk, our group had various degrees of capabilities and that coupled with the 30° heat and humidity did impact upon some of our party. The hike took best part of an hour to reach the top and the first pool with a natural slide. Next we moved down to another pool and the chance to take a 60 foot jump into the pool below, unfortunately only one of our group felt comfortable enough to do this. Last stop was a sightseeing break which provided amazing vistas of the surrounding area. As the sun began to set we began our journey back to our vehicle, a truly wonderful excursion and well worth the climb up and down. We've visited many waterfalls on our travels, and this one is definitely worth the trip! It is superb, with several swimming pools for swimming. Access requires a 20-30min walk one way, but it's worth it because there aren't too many tourists and the view is magnificent. However, be careful of slippery rocks. Its a must place to visit, there's no picture that could describe its beauty, you have to climb up the waterfall to enjoy it fully, be prepare to swim 😍 Get your driver (or drive yourself) up to the upper falls, but don’t accept a guide. They’ll try to scare you but the path is clearly marked and you can “No Thank you, good bye” your way past anyone offering their services unless you’re feeling generous. But on the stairs near the top is a lovely little coconut stall with two kids helping out their dad. These kids are ADORABLE and terrific little hosts. It’s worth the normal coconut fee for the electrolytes a the entertainment. This little stall made the trip for us. At the top, turn right for lower pools and view down falls, left for a more calm and safer swimming area. You can go there alone but please consider to hire Sudu. He is a guaid tour since 2003. During COVID he had no work 3 years and need to sell tuk tuk and even a smartphone. He is a great guide and take care of you during the trip. His phone no. +94 (70) 108 5255  Have fun! Amazing waterfalls. Really enjoyed my time here. If you are in Sri Lanka, it is a must see stop. You can swim in the waterfalls. Without a shadow of a doubt the most beautiful waterfalls in all of Srilanka. Scenic jumps, natural pools and breathtaking views. They can be reached with a short walk of about 15 minutes. If you want, at the starting point of the excursion which is located a couple of kilometers before the bridge where you can admire the last jump, you will also find numerous locals willing to accompany you for a few euros A must see, this waterfall is simply magnificent, majestic. In the middle of stones, trees and wild animals, this flow of water which falls from around 185m is simply relaxing. Great swim at the top of the waterfall. The walk to this place is not for the weakhearted or the ones with no endurance. But once you are there... Amazing! You can easily stay 2- 3 hrs just enjoying yourself. Bring some food or drinks, or buy a coconot from the man who sells them there. After a very short climb, you will be under the magnificent spell of the waterfall. The water is really cold but swimming is wonderfully enjoyable and the nature is wonderful. Before climbing the waterfall, you can drink king coconut below and watch the monkeys. Myself and my family (two young kids), debated whether to do the local waterfall from Ella called Ravanna Falls, or to make journey to Diyaluma waterfalls. We ended up doing both but we are very glad we made the extra effort to go to Diyaluma waterfalls as they are much more extensive than Ravanna and there are multiple different waterfalls and areas to swim, and even some places to jump into rock pools. However, we could not have done this trip without a guide. We would not have known which rock pools you could jump into and how to get up and down the mountain. In addition to that the guide will usually take you the first 2 km of the journey, and then you can walk the rest (1km).  In short, it is well worth the money. We were fortunate enough to have Saman as our guide, and not only was he incredibly knowledgeable about the waterfalls, as he was from the area, but he also had relatively good level of English, so we could communicate with him. He really went above and beyond, and even carried our six-year-old daughter on his shoulders up and down the tricky bits of the path (see picture below).  Saman can be contacted on +94 78 778 4560 if you want a great guide and an unforgettable experience. The best waterfall I have visited anywhere in the world. The great attraction is a series of linked pools towards the top that are ideal for swimming. It’s a fairly easy hike up and then a great day in the pools with some fabulous views. Ultimately good. We hiked through the forest and reached the upper and lower Diyaluma falls. There is a natural pool. When we went the water was more. Our guide helped us to find a safe place to have a bath. He took us with passion and patience . His name is Upendra. He speaks and understand English. We parked our car near the village . From there along with tuktuk to go up and down until the hiking point. He also came with us until the falls. He can be contacted at 0775474725. Our driver got a good deal by talking with him for both tuktuk and being a guide. After bath we changed our wet clothes in his house. Friendly people. I have included his photo with his shop. The falls and the forest just got imprinted into our heart. Beautiful road to the falls and extraordinary hike upto the top of the falls. A must do. But people should restrain from polluting the place with plastics. It is an amazing place to visit. A not to hard climb to the top… but when you get there, the view and the waterfall are amazing. Nice place, good view but from the bottom. It’s an easy access to the top but the local guides tell you that you need them as you may get lost in the jungle - not true. Just follow the crowd ;) on the top will just see „bloggers” taking solo pictures in the basin and the rock wall of the pool painted with tourist initialls. You can leave that view out. Being caught in the rain will only get things worse. one of the most beautiful palces in Uva province to visit. never miss Diyaluma and Upper diyaluma if you planned to visit Ella, Koslanda, Haputale, Bandarawela or wellawaya areas in Sri lanka. you will definetely have an adventerous day. This was one of our favourite days in Sri Lanka. Definitely worth a visit. As others say below, you can go with or without a guide. We had a guide from Ella whose company we really enjoyed, so we went up with him – but you could definitely find your way without a guide if you wanted to, maybe with a wrong turn or two along the way. We took the short 20-minute walk rather than the 2-hour hike, and didn’t regret it. The bottom pool is the busiest with tourists – but we found it was only really worth a short stay. The views are beautiful, and this is where everyone gets their photos – but that’s pretty much it. The second pool, a very short walk away, is good for a swim, and the view of the falls above you is pretty special. The third pool, directly above the second, and a short 2-3 minute hike up, features an 8m cliff jump. We did it and were perfectly safe – but I wouldn’t do it without being shown by a local guide. There are plenty around the first pool who can show you. We did it a couple of times – every time, my feet hit the bottom of the pool at the end of the jump, but not hard enough to be of any concern – just a surprise first time around! We then had a lovely time at the top of the third pool, sitting in the sun and relaxing. Well worth a trip. If you enjoy the process of getting to the waterfalls (hiking a bit), plunging (not for the faint-hearted) and swimming in the pools; you'd definitely relish this particular waterfall! There are many layers, the view is amazing and the water is cool and clean. The only pity is that the locals sometimes leave their trash behind so please leave only (wet) footprints! When you do get to the last part, you'd find yourself on top of the cascading water and be greeted with a stunning view of the landscape before you. I stayed a safe distance away from the edge due to my fear of heights/ falling but I was really glad that I made it out there. As with all waterfalls, tread carefully and stay safe. I'd skip Ravana Falls and pick this anytime. Diyaluma Falls is located near the town of Koslanda on the Wellawaya Road in Colombo via Beragala. It is situated near the main road. It is second tallest  waterfall in Sri Lanka  and is 220m high. If you don't want to get scammed 2000 rupee for a 20 min walk to the waterfall then check the location in the attached photos. This place gives free parking (the rest charge) and they have steps that go straight up to the waterfall. Just follow up, wqlk along with barbed wire on right, through a small bit of woods (wear shoes or sandles). You can hear the waterfall on right and you will probably see guides walking with paying tourists along the way... once at the waterfall go left (many ways to plunge pools further up. Please up vote this so other tourists can decide to pay or not pay. (The place on the photos also has rooms, food, snacks, cold water etc - they are very nice family). We stopped by the waterfall and it looks stunning from the bottom. But even better was to go up with one of the local guides - they drove us by tuk tuk and then brought us to the top of the waterfall (15 minutes walking). We could swim there in lovely natural pools right above the fall! :)) It was such fun! We took many pictures, then he took us to another swimming area and showed us where is it safe to jump into the water (we didn't, it was like 8 meters jump! :D). The only thing you need to be careful of is the water quality (not pure) - you might get ear aching if you dive - clean your ears afterwards. The contact for our guide: Mr. Sudu, 070185255 - he speaks good English. ;) Try one of the older roads in Sri Lanka from Wallawaya to Haputhale through Koslanda and you will see Diyaluma on your way. Diyaluma situate beside Beragala Wellawaya rode 6Km away from Koslanda. If you need to use, public transport also possible to reach this place. Once you reach there, you can climb up few steps up if water level is law. There is a pool up there. But be careful to bath there, better not to. It's sleapery also. We rented a scooter in Ella and took the 1 hour ride (1:20 to the top) to visit the magnificent waterfall. On the food of it you can take a climb to bath in the pools below the fall. After it you can take another 20 minutes on bad roads to the top. Place your scooter there (100 rupies) and walk over (40 minutes) to the pools to chill. Definitely recommended. It is a day trip. On the food of the waterfall you can buy water. Bring your food :) It is the second highest waterfall in sri lanka. On the up, woow thats the place.. #naturalpool #hiking #chilling #camping The Diyaluma falls is the second largest waterfall in Sri Lanka and it's looks very fashionable on water getting down from up Hills. Travelers can view the waterfall from the road. The lost of Monkeys around the waterfall. Normally we like to go things alone but I suggest getting a guide who can take you to the places to swim (and jump if you desire!) and for good photo shoots. Stunning waterfall!!  We hired a scooter from Ella and ventured here. At the base guides will try and offer services to the top. This is easily achievable without their services if you are adventurous. They said a scooter will not make it to where the climb starts, we made it with ease. The trek is somewhat difficult depending on fitness. Would allow minimum 3 hours round trip. But more would be preferable. We spent 4 or so up and down We took tuk tuk from haputale 3500lkr Driver waited on us, however we came back down same way as went up, he was apparently waiting on other side... So make sure you clear this up.. Good 20min walk up to top of falls well worth it what a view. You won't need a guide path is pretty obvious.. Neraby Town is quaint stop for a nosey around locals are friendly Today we visited the amazing diyaluma falls. For this trip we stayed in the nice town Wellayama, from this place it's a short trip (20 minutes by tuktuk) to the diyaluma falls. Wellayama is located 40 minutes from Ella and easy to travel from or to the national parks in the south. From this town it's also verry easy to visit the buduruwagala rock temple (360Lkr) wich is verry beautifull and not touristic at all! We stayed at Bindu Homestay and i can higly recommend this place. It's a verry friendly family and he also has his own tuk tuk and car to bring you to all places you want. They will do everething to put a smile on your face, they are great! We drove to the bottom of the waterfall by car, it’s beautiful to see. Lots of people just stop there ....... not us! We then took a tuk tuk as far as possible as the road becomes non-drivable. The tuk tuk driver became our walking guide to the top of the fall and to another hidden waterfall you cannot see from the road. The hike is approx 30-40 minutes with varied difficulty. Honestly do it!! Wow wow wow it is just simply stunning. There were no tourists up there, when we went, only local kids and us swimming and playing in the falls. One of my favourite experiences of Sri Lanka and travelling the world. So so lucky to have such an experience Amazing view and experience ! Would highly recommend to take a Tuk-Tim WITH GUIDE to reach the top of the waterfalls. Several tuk tuk drivers are trying to sell you their service but we would definitely recommend to go to the small and lonely family shop which is on the left handside when looking at the waterfall . Their son, Tharindu (0719702456) is such a lovely person . He took us to the waterfall and took great pictures . So nice and genuine person! Beautiful place worth a visit. At the beginning you will expect a climb of about 45 min, but it is worth it! Views, small waterfalls and lakes are perfect for swimming. This place has enchanted us! It is worth the trek to get here both walking the and tuk tuk here. We ended up spending 3 hours here enjoying the rock pools and waterfalls. You must come here Wow. Could not recommend going to Diyaluma Falls more. It was an absolute highlight for not just our trip to Ella, but Sri Lanka as a whole. Such a beautiful waterfall, amazing views, you can swim (definitely recommend as it’s a lot of fun!) and the hike isn’t too hard to get there. The only thing is, you do need a guide to walk you to the spots to go. When you arrive by tuk tuk, there will be guides there that will offer their service, at first you don’t think you need them but I’m telling you... you definitely do. So many turns and there’s no clear path in the slightest, and they take heaps of photos for you ! We went with a guy named Dennis (071 988 1825 if anyone wants to get in contact with him) and he said we decide on a price at the end depending on how happy we were with his service. We ended up paying 2,000 rupee for 3 of us which I think is very reasonable. Also, a tuk tuk from Ella to the falls was 4,000 rupee, they all say 6,000 only but you can definitely find someone who will do it for 4,000 just takes a bit of bartering and searching ! The Diyaluma Falls were such a beautiful sight as it had rained and water was gushing. This water fall is the second highest water fall in Sri-Lanka and the 361 st highest waterfall in the world. It is an amazing sight during the  rainy season. It is worthwhile seeing and it is easy to see, it as it is by the road side. You can watch the lower and the highest cascade of Diyaluma Falls on the Wellawaya Road. That is called Lower Diyaluma Falls. But the real treasure is the Upper Diyaluma Falls, for which you have to hike up through the jungle. It has multiple cascades and natural pools of every size, each one unique in its own way. You can reach the top of the falls in a considerably short time. There are small shops set up at some places as well. Please make sure to bring back the polythene and plastic you take. Leave only your footprints. Stunning multiple waterfalls and a great place to swim. ""Guides"" are not needed !! After thoroughly researching the falls we were confident on how to get to them with clear instructions saved on our phones. after parking our Tuk tuk at the top carpark we were asked multiple times if we would like a guide. After saying no and following our saved directions we set off to find our path only to be followed by one of the ""guides"" from the carpark. We were told we were going the wrong way and he directed us down some path in which he said was the right way. We trusted this advice as we thought he was being genuinely helpful. This path was overgrown and full of leeches (have a bottle of insect repellent and lighter ready to spray/burn them off as soon as you feel them) after eventually reaching and exploring the waterfalls we found a much much better path back. we popped out (surprise, surprise) where we were originally headed before being led astray by the guides advice. After returning to our Tuk Tuk and confronting the guide we asked him if the path we were going to follow was were the guides go and he laughed in our face and said yes. We expressed our disappointment at his actions and said in Australia or New zealand we would never do this to tourists or deliberately lead them astray simply because they chose to make their own way. Below are clear instructions how to get the falls without utilising the guides who take advantage of tourists and deliberately confuse them or make up that google maps wont work or that its extremely difficult to find the falls, both of which turned out to be lies. Follow this reviews instructions - however after walking past the green and white gate walk for about 50m then take a sharp right onto a wide path. From there traverse around the hillside towards the sound of rushing water and you'll find the various waterfalls. There are two ways to see this beautiful waterfall: from below - you need to overcome big high stones (of you need to wear snickers, better to have snickers for tracking), and then you’ll enjoy a very cool view of the waterfall from the earth, it’s very high and athmospheric, the sun and drops when you are inside the waterfall are amazing! And the second way - upper view, and it’s absolutely unbelievable , because upstairs you have a possibility to visit all small and so small ponds connected with each other! And you can also swim inside them and enjoy a very amazing Mountain View from the very high spots. It’s one of the most beautiful waterfalls we’ve ever seen at the moment. Less people. And very cool route, cause you need to go through the jungle. Absolutely must visit. Much better and more beautiful than Rawana waterfall. We have visited the fall today. We had to hike to the upper coarse of the fall to swim. We are not sure how to go up and we hire a guide to walk up. We walk up from Diyaluma Inn. There are plenty of Leeches en route. We feel very uncomfortable being bite by the leeches. The hike is medium level~ and have to go up the rocky road. We have chatted with other tourist and find out there is another route to leave the fall. The route is better and no leeches. Upper diyaluma is a place with a beautiful view. If you planning to camp in upper diyaluma , first go to koslanda and from there go to poonagla which is about 7km. There are few other routs too to go to upper diyaluma but from poonagala it’s shorter and there are places to park your vehicles safe too. You can hire a person from poonagala for directions to the falls or you can even follow others. From there it’s about 45 minutes walk and it’s not a difficult walk. There are places to do camping and on a holiday or weekend there will be many people camping. So if you planning on a holiday, make sure you reach the place as early as possible so you can get a good place to pitch your tents. Also there is a small shop where you can get roti and some curries. It’s not a fixed shop so timings of the shop changes depending on the crowed. If you can get hold of the old but nice person who is at the shop you don’t need to worry about your food. Please minimize your plastic use while your are there and make sure you don’t leave any plastic behind. That is a vest waterfall hikking expirience at the koslanda area with 2nd highest waterfall in sri lanka. Diyaluma waterfall 📸☝ Beautiful natural place. Those who wants to feel the real nature this is the place.You can swim in the pools and even jump off cliffs. Beautiful views! #nice #enjoy #srylankanadventures #nature_water #nature_swim_pool 🏊 #like #travelwiththiraj We went to this place 🚗 Enjoying my client oscar & his wife ros💑 What a remarkable place in Sri Lanka. It’s just wow. Stunning waterfall. You will find a very relaxing surrounding area there as well. No words to tell about this destination and this beautiful, natural waterfall. Sri Lankans are surely one of those lucky people on Earth. We are a family of 4 (2 kids age 10/13) and spent the day around the falls. We took a bus from Ella to Wellawaya (45 min, 300 rs). From there, our guide for the day (Tharindu, +94 719702456) picked us up by tuktuk. Of you have a car, you could also come straight to the falls on your own. Tharindu lives at the base of the falls. We first spent half and hour climbing and playing on the boulders at the bottom of the falls/river. Then Tharindu brought us with the tuktuk halfway up the mountain, from where we hiked 30 min to the falls. We recommend bringing a guide, because it saves you a lot of walking and you won’t get lost (which is easy). When we got to the top of the falls, it was a bit crowded with locals because of the weekend. We hiked 10 min further up to Upper Diyaluma falls, which where even nicer! There, we swam in the pools and climbed up to the top, from where our kids jumped off from a 8 meter rock in the pool! Awesome! Tharindu was really nice and helpful and encouraged the kids with the swimming and jumping. He also makes really nice pictures (and loves the panorama setting!). We had a great day all together. Don’t hesitate to give Tharindu a call. Waterfall of about 100 meters high. It's possible to go in the pool, buy only if the water level is not too high. Amazing and dreamy waterfall with a slippery hill. Worth to bring good shoes and clothes but great for a jump in the waterfall and the natural slide. A lot of locals offering tours. Very nice people but not necessarily needed. A must do when visiting Sri Lanka. There's a place in Naulla where you can drive up and park the vehicles. From there you can hike up for about 1.5km We had a superb guide called Shan. He can be contacted on +94711635697 He knows all the spots to take breathtaking photos and have a dip in the ice cold water gushing from the rocks. Impressive waterfall, with a good view from the roadside bridge. There is a walk you can do to the top of it, but it looks like hot work so we didn't bother. About a 20 minute detour off of the main road up to Ella, which we thought was worth it. My husband and I hiked the Diyaluma Falls, we hired a guide with a tuktuk, we ride the tuktuk for like 7 minutes, then we contined by foot. the views from the top are great, we enjoyed the pools so much. make sure you wear the right shoes for this hike, as it is not an easy one. our great guide was with us the whole time, his name is Tharindu Mihiranga, his phone number: +94719702456. Contact of a guide while visiting Dialuma falls. He lives on the path to the falls and seemed like knowing the area quite well. We paid 1000 rupees for a few hours of trekking. To go there, we got out of the bus (from Wellawaya to Haputale) very close to Naulla where there is a sign saying ‘Shortcut to Dialuma’. Just follow the path and you will see his house in a few hundred meters. Name is Dinesh and number 071 0625851 and 071 9881825. If u traveling in ella and Haputhale Diyaluma is best place to visit . U can get there easily from bottom of diyaluma falls when u walking down to koslanda direction around the 300m , there is foot path to top that will take a 30min to reach Definetly worth the hike and worth the adrenaline rush when you swim in the pools up top! Don't forget to take the diyaluma short cut trail as it makes the access to the top much easier ! If you can go early in the morning that would be great as it gets busier as the day passes We got a guide, but you don't absolutely need one. We didn't regret having a guide because we are quite weak, and at least the guide could.help us at some part. Once you reach the top, there's many ""pools"". There's quite some people, but it's not overly crowded. If the big ""pool"" is crowded, just head to behind and there are small pool with small falls. Stand under the fall and let it wash away all your tiredness. It's about 1 hr past drive from ella town, but I highly recommend it. As compared to ravana falls (we went past twice), diyaluma looks alot better! I suggest you to roam around Nuwara Eli, Haputale and then at last come to see the Diyaluma falls.. go under the water dropping and throw away your tiredness!! No words to explain that feeling!!! We've spent almost 3 weeks in sri lankan and this was by far the best thing. We got a tuk tuk from Ella for 5000 rupee for 3 people. The guy also guided us on foot to the actual falls (you won't find them on your own). It is amazing. The waterfall isnt touristy at all so the path is overgrown so you'll  need to watch out for leeches and ticks. Despite this it's so worth it. Don't forget your swimmers as there is lots of jumping and swimming to be had. Enjoy! Diyaluma Falls is the second highest waterfall in Sri Lanka at 720ft high. Located about 6km from Koslanda in the Badulla District, and 38km from Ella, this horsetail waterfall has multiple falls and natural pools for you to dive into, refresh yourself and explore. Diyaluma Falls can be explored from both above and below, as the base of the falls also has a pool you can dive into! The best time to visit would be for sunrise as you get to see the rising sun shine upon the waves crashing down, however, sunset isn’t a bad option either, just be weary that you may need to travel back towards the main road in total darkness. It was fascinating waterfall. We had a hard time to go up , i had an injury on the way. But the view the spot was amazing. One of the most beautiful place in my life i see. But coz alot of things happen to us we perefer to come down as soon as we can. My friend fell into the lake , i sliped on the rocks. We didnt take any first aid with ourself. If i go back before i go to this place i really pack some first aid with my self and then go to this beautiful place. Thia waterfall is amazing ! First, the hike to the uppermost level of the waterfall takes you through breathtaking scenery. Mind that you have to do proper research online so you find out the right way for the beautiful hike. The starting point is a fee hundred meters South from Diyaluma Falls Inn. The local tuk tuk drivers will try to sell you tours, no need to get one. Once you get to the top of the waterfall, you start to descend, following the flow of water and you go through several “stages” of the waterfall, each with beautiful little pools where you can take baths. The lowest level is actually the top of the waterfall that you see from the main road. From there, you descend on a dirt path and reach a point close to Naulla village. So, the start and end points are different. This is the best way to go, in my opinion. You will enjoy amazing views and a good workout ;) There is quite a bumpy road to get to these falls on the A4. They were worth it though even though there is not much water coming down. We didn’t try to get to the top of the falls but our driver said it was possible. We didnt go up top which we really should have but we still really enjoyed the view from below. You can climb to the base and actually swim in the water fall while letting the water fall on you. Really beautiful place but really far from everything. I gave it 4 stars because of the tough climb to get to the top. Otherwise, it is indeed a multi-level beautiful waterfall with a number of pools to sit or have fun in. We rode a motorbike from Ella, took about 1-1.5hrs. Fairly good roads  except for the last 15min stretch which were bumpier. At the base of the waterfall (some distance away from the actual waterfall), there is a small parking area and an inn. There are a few local boys/ young men waiting and will offer their service as a guide. We could have bargained to 1500lkr but paid the 2000lkr asked, after hearing from other travellers at our guesthouse how they topped up 500lkr in the end after experiencing the amount of walking and the guide waiting to bring them down at the end. The walk up starts with a fairly straightforward dirt path through rubber trees and a small cluster of houses. However, the rest of it is a climb up the mountain, on uneven, scrabbly rocks, large and small, and cut-in steps in the ground. You should be young or of moderate fitness to do this. Definitely wear proper shoes and have sunscreen and water. Preferably start early in the day and wear longer pants, as the tall grass growing towards the path for much of the climb can get itchy after a while. You will also appreciate the helping hand of the guide as you climb.. At the top there is a coconut seller, then slightly downhill to the actual waterfall. It is fairly easy to get to the various levels of the waterfall. Be careful stepping in and out of the pools as the rocks are slippery with moss. There is only a roti and coconut seller at the waterfall itself. Bring some snacks or you can buy them from the few village grocery shops on the road in. Very friendly locals, we smiled and waved to everyone. From the bottom of the waterfall, you will need to climb back up again to the top where the coconut seller is, to go all the way down again. It takes about 1hr each way. This place is behind a hike. The hike up the hill tries to kill you but when you get to natures own pools.. It is just worth it. The scenery and atmosphere is something out of this world, so beautiful. There is many pools to hang out in and we definetly recommend to start your cooling down process from the bottom pools and to work your way up the hill. We were lucky to have our Tuktuk driver as a guide, you should really hire someone to get the most out of this place!! This place is really amazing, maybe one of the best place to visit in Sri Lanka, you can go to the top of the fall, swim and have some great picture, it's good to go with a local guide, because you need to walk in jungle for around 2Km, and it's difficult to find the way... Lower Diyaluma falls can be seen from the roadside - a massive cascade. But the real treasure are upper Diyaluma falls, a 3/4 mile hike up. There are multiple accessible bathing waterfall pools  - each one unique. Most are easy to enter pools but one is for daredevils only -  a 5m deep pool with a 20m high edge to jump from! Beautiful waterfall. You can swim at the top so wear swimming gear. Do this with a guide as you’ll probably get lost otherwise. We paid 1500 LKR for ours with a group of 3. Don’t believe the tuk tuk drovers who threaten you with a “3 hour walk” to the top - with moderate fitness you can do it in about an hour going at a comfortable pace. Tuk tuk doesn’t get you anywhere near the top and you still have the hardest part of the walk to do so don’t waste your money. My wife and I (both 27) hired a scooter from Ella and drove down to Diyaluma and Buduruwagala. It was an incredible day and Diyaluma is like nothing else in the world. The drive from Ella was stunning as we drove through the mountains and then the fields. We went to Diyaluma first as it is more weather dependent and easier to climb in the morning before the heat. We parked up at the bottom of the falls and paid a local 1000 rupees to take us to the top (we probably could have haggled them down lower). Only pay them to take you up, as once you know the way it's easy to follow it back down. No need to pay them to wait! At the top there are a succession of waterfalls and pools which you can swim in and take photos of. It is very peaceful and beautiful and very few other people were there. We worked our way down the falls until we came to the final 170m fall. It is absolutely breathtaking and feels like you are standing at the top of the world looking down on it. The vertical drop means the view is completely unobscured. We This is an amazing place and is our top recommendation for everyone visiting the hill country. Make the effort to visit from Ella and you will be rewarded. The waterfalls were lovely and definitely worth a visit however you may want to get a guide. It seems compared to other reviews we went the hard way as ours was about a hour hike or more up rocks with a steep incline. I am quite fit but it was not easy. Definitely doable but will leave you breathless. Also there are leeches in the water so bear this in mind. If you go in the pools with running water you should be ok but check yourself before you leave. This is a whole day trek so I would leave early I wouldn't want to be walking around in the dark. You can catch a bus there first to Wyallaway then another bus to the falls very cheap compared to a tuk tuk. As you have likely read, this is the second highest waterfall in Sri Lanka. Whether that’s the main falls, or the combination of all three in the system, I couldn’t figure out. That however didn’t distract from the breathtaking beauty of the falls and the surrounding area. We caught a Tuk Tuk from Ella, which is probably the best option. It took roughly 1.5 hours to get to the base of the falls, and gave us the opportunity to enjoy the surrounding countryside. If driving from Ella, you’ll get to see Little Adam’s Peak, Ella Rock and can stop at Ravena falls on the way. From the base, you can ether walk, or take a Tuk Tuk (over some incredibly rocky ground - find an experienced driver!) half way, and walk the remaining kilometer. At the peak, you’ll find a smaller falls, which runs through pools into the main attraction. The water was clear, warm and a great reward after the hike. The view from the top is also one of the best we’ve found so far. The walk is a little steep but should be suitable for most. Bring some snacks and make sure to include this in your itenerary if you have the time! This beautiful water fall is only the second heighst, next to Bambarakanda falls.you need to walk a long way to observe many falls but this unique water fall is by the side of Colombo-Baticaloa main road and there are many access to it. I too the Haputale Beragal road where you turn from Beragal to reach the fall and it takes about 45 minutes. On rainy days the flow of the fall changes rapidly , therefore it is a bit dangerous to bath in it. As the spray falls right to the road you have to be careful with your camera lenses. However it is a beautiful and a panoramic site to watch the white water falling . When the weather is dry and the rate of water falling is less, it would be good to have a dip but when it rains and the water fall changes its falling rate, better not take undue risks in bathing as the flow of water suddenly increase from the top. Diyaluma falls is a must visit and its more better if u can camp up there or below the stream. Sunsets are magical from uptop Start ur hike  early morning to avoid traffic on the hiking route and less photo bombing  by others and it's less warm. Takes about 40mins ~ 1hr one way This is one of the hidden gem of a waterfall in Sri Lanka. Bandarawela, via poonagala estate can go to this place. After half an hour trek. Wild elephants are there so better to be cautious. There are three steps of the waterfall. Can go to each and everyone of them. Can have a bath but better to keep an eye of flash floods. On the last step there is a steep drop so better to watch out when having a bath there. Truly wonderful experience and hidden treasure of nature. It's quite the sight to take in . There is a hidden path on to the left of the waterfall which can be used to get close to the base of the fall. Tread carefully along this side and you will be rewarded for your attempt. There is also a way to reach the top of the falls. Speak to the locals and they will tell you the best way to the top. Enjoy Diyaluma ! Alongside the road you cross one of the most spectacular waterfalls in Sri Lanka and you can get ou of your car or tuktuk to make the most beautiful photographs Away from Badulla-colombo main road, at the Beragala junction , theres a road that leads to the falls. Diyaluma falls is situated near the main road,you can have a rest before you pass it. Really worth watching. Such an amazing falls. Another lovely waterfall in the hills of Sri Lanka. You can see it from the road and viewing platform. Worth a short break when passing. We have gone here a couple of times and each time it is just as magical as first time! Can get a bit busy during peak season so go early and spend an hour there immersing in the beauty. We were dropped off the Poonagala road where the upper Diyaluma falls trek started. At first we didn’t knew which way to go, but that’s not a problem. There is always someone who will guide you to the waterfall. At first, we tried the find the location on our own. After a while, we decided to pay a guide, which was a very good decision as it was fast and cheap. Finally we arrived at the top of the diyaluma falls, but it was not what I expected. So many people in the pools and so touristic. Not an instagram worthy picture.. but the view was amazing!! Watch out when you go to visit the diyaluma falls when it rains, it’s sooo slippery!! Diyaluma falls is a beautiful water fall, it was a nice sight as it was after the rains. Saw it after a very long time, & the good thing is there is a new enclosed area to watch the falls & take photographs as people had to see it from the main road which is very dangerous. Thanks to whoever did it. amazing hike and views are great at the top- foolishly forgot to bring our stuff for a swim which was a shame as loads of great pools for dip it's about an easy 30 minute trail path walk from the car park. directions: Facing the car park take the road left and follow it bearing right around the corner. After about 5 minutes you will come across and green and white gate (looks like private property drive going downhill). Go through the gate, or if it's locked you can walk around it. a few metres in front is a sign and take the path that leads right. it's a clear footpath the whole way and it leads through a field of long grass, not very steep. follow this trail for about 15/20 minutes and you will hear the waterfall. you will see a hut and follow the path to the right a few hundred metres. you will see the pools and the rest is pretty simple from there! Be careful the big rock you have to walk across is quite steep, some people were sliding down on their bums. its totally worth it even just to swim around the upper pools, they are beautiful. some points you can jump off ledges into, they're very deep. the Sri Lankan children are dare devils and very fun to watch. we didn't go down to the actual waterfall because we didn't have time, our taxi driver gave us 2 hours. but could have easily spent half a day here. It's right at the side of the main road. So if you are coming this way you can stop and admire it. I would not drive out of the way for hours for this one. But if you are going that way definitely have a look. Natural rock pools and waterfalls. We first visited the bottom of the falls by tuk tuk, then he drove us another 30 minutes to reach a property at the top. From here we walked about 20-30 minutes with the help of our tuk tuk driver pointing us in the right direction. People will ask to take you on a ‘guided’ tour, our driver said not to do this because it’s unsafe and costs a lot of money. The people offering tours are not guides and not have licenses. You have to pay 100 rupee parking fee at the place you park your tuk tuk or scooter. After the walk we then reached the first rock pool and waterfall where you can bathe and jump down a big waterfall into a plunge pool. You can then ask some locals to direct you to a path that takes you to the edge of where the waterfall drops down 200 or so metres. Moderate fitness level recommended. It is situated 6-10 km away from Koslanda in Badulla District on Colombo-Badulla highway.The foot of the Diyaluma falls is quite easy to reach within an hour by tuk-tuk, car or motorbike. The last 15 minutes of the drive will be uphill and the road isn’t the best from that point. At the foot of the waterfall, pass the bridge and follow the path to the waterfall. Beautiful surrounding. Very risky to bath here during rainy days. Near to waterfall you can have hot plain tea with juggery. Such a beautiful waterfall and it’s worth climbing to the top so you can play and swim in the natural pools and then walk alongside the falls to the point where it drops. It’s really good fun! We found a local kid who was offering to take us and we joined up with another couple of people and it cost us 1,500rupees between us 4- worth it to get the local perspective, walking through rubber tree factories and beautiful scenery. Be prepared for a good 20min hike uphill so wear trainers for better grip. The locals do it in flit flips no issue but us Westerners aren’t used to this terrain. On our way to Koslanda we saw this beautiful waterfall. It is worth stopping by. The road on the highland of Sri Lanka is beautiful in general. In the summer of 2018 we (Dutch familie of 4, kids 13 and 18) travelled to discover the beauties of Sri Lanka. It took us one hour and a half to drive from Liptons Seat to these waterfalls... Impressive in heighth, but unfortunately not too much water coming down outside the monsoon season. We did not have the time to walk to the top to take a swim. We stopped in Koslanda and followed a local guide to the top of the waterfall. We swam in a pool (which we had all to ourselves) and continued the climb down. It was beautiful and well worth it. We stop by, went for a walk and a short dip inn the bottom pool. We ended up talking to people from all over the world. We drove here by motorbike from Ella and it took a us about 1.5 hours with photo breaks etc. There wasn’t a lot of water despite visiting in rainy season but because it was so windy, it produced some awesome shapes with the water. If you have time and transport, I’d deffo recommend a visit as it’s the 2nd tallest waterfall in Sri Lanka. We went to this waterfall in July 2018. To get to the top of the waterfall, you can go alone or ask a guide to take you there. You can find those guides at the bridge. We had a really awesome guide, called Sudu. You can ask after him when you're there, he's awesome and he will give a lot of extra information on the way to the top. During the hike, there's even a chance that you will spot some elephants when you're in luck. One of the best experiences of my life! We hired a scooter in Ella and made our way out here during our day. We wished we had been better prepared time wise and been able to go to the top of the falls but it was still awesome from the bottom. We went for a swim under the waterfall and it was a pretty cool experience I’d recommend to check it out. Took us about an hour via scooter from Ella. We hired a scooter in Ella and stopped off at Diyaluma Falls on a bit of a round trip in the countryside. The road to get there was in good condition and picturesque. The Diyaluma Falls are easily seen from the road which makes it easy for pulling over and having a look. It is a long drive along a terrible road to get to here, which is why you don't get many foreign tourists. I saw coach loads of Sri Lankans, though. Not really worth walking up the track to the foot of the waterfall -- you get a better view from the road, especially about 500m toward Wellawaya. It is rather puny if there has been no rain, but after a decent rainstorm it is stunning. It's the tallest waterfall in Sri Lanka but so what?  You can only view it from the busy road that goes by it. Its far too dangerous to try and even get your toes in the water or wash your face. There is no safe access to the water either At 171m, Petaluma Ella fall is the third highest waterfall in Sri lanka, it is natural swimming pool here, beautiful falls, next to the road. So you don't need to hike there. It is a bit of a D-tour to get here, as the road to/from the falls is not in good shape. We could only drive like 40 km/h the whole way. But it is worth it! We weren't expecting the falls to be so dramatically beautiful.  We also enjoyed seeing the macaques in this area. We returned here after a year away and the falls were not so spectacular as we have seen on previous occasions, but we were not in the heavy rainy season. At all times of year these falls are impressive being some 220m in height. They are very easily accessible on the highway from Belihul Oya to Wellawaya and one can easily park, enjoy a splash in the water and take advantage of the road-side vendors who sell water, corn, nibbles and so on. As with all falls, the rainy period is by far the best time to see them at their spectacular best. We took the bus from Haputale and asked the driver to drop us at the Diyaluma waterfall (LKR 80 / $0.50). Its a very beautiful waterfall, if you can make time for it, don't miss it. Its worth it, no entrance fees. It rained two days in a row before we came to the falls and we got a very good view. You can see it from the main road and even feel the mist while standing on the road. There are local shops where you can get a corn or mango or some other local fruit. We went back on a bus, there is a bus every hour and half. A nice waterfall where you can take a dip.  Easy to get to and cool.  Can get quite busy mid morning so get there early.  Not sure how high you can climb, but a couple of hidden gems This is the second highest waterfall in Sri Lanka at 220 metres but we learnt that it is far more spectacular in the wet season and when you can soaked standing on the road next to the waterfall. Local vendors sell freshly cooked corn on the cob . A beautiful water fall along the Koslanda- Beragala - Wellawaya road, lovely for photographs. One can see it from the road without going up to the waterfall. Unfortunately it was not at its full beauty due to the drought. During the rainy season it is such a beautiful sight. One of the nicest water falls in Sri-Lanka. this is probably the third time i visited the waterfall and never saw so much of water before and it's awesome.. So everyone can enjoy the beauty of Diyaluma easily by the Koslanda - Wellawaya road. There is a way to get to the top of Diyaluma with a short and enjoyable hike. You have to travel  bit further towards Poonagala and find the foot path by the makaldeniya bend. On the way to Poonagala also you will find several beautiful rivers. Ask a local they will show you the road. Then there is a hike to go to the top of Diyaluma. Go to there around 9-9:30 in the morning because a local warned me that there are elephants around 6-7 in the morning. At the end of the hike, you can get down to the point where the water finally descends the 200m. You can peep over the edge the look down at the main road. Be care full. The pool created by the first cascade is good for bath. The view over the edge is amazing and worth all the steps in the hike. See the pictures. Although we came from the other direction and it took 45 minutes each way, the falls were well worth the trip, even the hold-up on the way back as they were renovating a large bridge!  The falls are 220 metres high and tumble in long silvery plumes against a dark brown rock-face. There are also small refreshment places nearby.  You may do a bit of rock scrambling to get close if you wish, but the best view is from the road bridge. Of all the falls that we saw in Sri Lanka, this was probably the best. DIyaluma waterfall is one of the tallest once in Sri Lanka. This is few of waterfalls that can be access easily by a vehicle including public transport as this has situated next to a main road. For a good view, you have to go in rainy season as in dry season very little water will fall. Diyaluma Falls is the second highest water fall in Sri lanka, this water fall is located between Koslanda - Wellawaya road. We stay at Haputale and went for a excursion to visit Diyaluma Falls. Beautiful place to visit. Situated at the roadside of Haputale to Wellavaya road. There is a observation platform to watch built in the period of previous government. The Diyaluma Falls can be seen from afar as you approach them travelling from Wellawaya to Beragala. We have seen these falls on many occasions but strongly advise, if possible, to visit during the wet season when they are spectacular. On this occasion (January) we remained impressed by the incredible height of the falls but the volume of water was very low. There are places to get water, drinks and snacks on the roadside at the foot of the falls. If travelling this road, it is worth stopping to enjoy the incredible power of nature. You must see this place in rainy season .November,December or April  the waterfall is full of water.Diyaluma is near by the Wallawaya Beragala  road  you have to climb  some places to see the nice view carefully On the way to Tissamaharama from Ella we took a slight detour (12 Kms, I believe) on a bumpy road and arrived at this gem. Despite it being a dry season and the flow of water anything but incredible, the tall waterfall was a nice sight. There were hardly any tourists. One can easily spend a good 30 minutes over here. Highly recommended during the wet season. after going to Rawana falls and sharing the beauty with 40-50 other backpackers, heading to Ella where we were the only people around was such a treat.  We didn't hike up to the top but jumped into the water where recent rains had the waterfalls coming down heavily.  It takes about 5-10 minutes to trek up the rocks and make sure you bring shoes not flip flops. It was a rainy day but at the verge of drought .so current of water was there but enough to satisfy us.tried to climb Ella .but late day, rain and wild elephant prevented the journey The majestic Diyaluma Falls drops 220 metres and is best seen during the rainy season when there is a lot of water flowing. It has been called the ""waterfall of smoking water."" It is on the Beragala to Wellawaya road, a short distance from the small town of Koslanda. The road is narrow, potholed and has some mud, so be careful when driving or riding, especially in wet weather. Very beautiful waterfall.... close to Koslanda.. You can visit on your way to Beragala from Wellawaya. This is just next to the main road from Beragala to Wellawaya. Can easily reach by public transportation. For adventure seekers, there is a path to climb to the top of the falls. We visited here on the advice of our guesthouse in Haputale. We hiked up and down Lipton's Seat in the morning and then caught the Wellawaya bus at about 2pm. Bus was mega full (it was a Sunday) and we didn't get a seat. It was hot and bumpy and we were happy to get of the bus after 1hr and a half. It was dry season so there wasn't much water, but the falls were impressive nonetheless. We didn't hang around too long at the bottom because it was a bit touristy. Instead we attempted the hike to the top, as described in the Lonely Planet (2012 edition). A young boy from the village volunteered to guide us along the way. To be honest we would have struggled without him, so we gave him 10Rs. ostensibly to buy school supplies. He put us on the right path and we scrambled up for 20min to the top. You should make sure to take plenty of water for the hike, and don't wear flip-flops. At the top we hoped to have the pools to ourselves, as we were hot and sweaty and just wanted to jump in the water. Surprisingly there were a few groups of locals (one getting a bit boozy), and some German girls attracting attention in their bikinis. We just took our boots off and cooled our feet off while chatting to the locals (apparently a family of wild elephants come here for a drink most days at around 6:30pm). Sadly we didn't go to the top of the actual falls, because we had to get the bus back to Haputale. It looked really cool and would probably make a great photo. The REAL HIGHLIGHT for me was in fact the bus ride back up to Haputale. Buses going up come approx. every 30min, and the last one is at 1830. It took us just over an hour to hike up, 20min at the top, and 45min to get back down, so we caught the bus at about 1720. There was plenty of space on the bus, and it was a magical journey through the forested hills overlooking the southern lowlands as the sun sets over the mountains. Keep your eyes peeled for macaques as you drive up! Give yourself more time than we did if you're using public transport. Alternatively, if you have your own transport, take a torch with you, stay to see the elephants. :) A beautiful sight to behold. You could actually take a bath at the foot of the falls. Great photography opportunity. It is great to watch the waterfalls by the koslanda-wellawaya road, sipping tea seated in a road side shop. But there is a way to get to the top of the fall. One has to travel bit further towards poonagala and find the foot path by the makaldeniya bend. Ask a local they will show you the path. After some tough terrain one can get to the place where the cascade begins. The cascade consists about 7 levels before reaching the 200 meter odd diyaluma fall. You can make your way through the through the tall manna to the lower levels. Mind your steps! The are cases of accidental and suicidal death caused by falling over one of the cascade. Extremely slippery. Stay off the edges. The pool created by the first cascade is good for bath. You can get down to the point where the water finally descends the 200m. You can peep over the edge the look down at the main road. Be care full. Great for a short hike. I made this trip alone. But if you can find a companion. Never know when things can go wrong. Another beautiful waterfall in the country and a great place for amazing photograph. The visit to this place so much worth ... Beautiful waterfall close to where we stayed - Living Heritage, Koslanda - we stopped to enjoy the scenery and take some photos on our way. This is by far one of the best waterfalls I've been to. The main reasons for that is , there are less people frequenting this place (not a soul was around when we were there) and entire experience from the trek to having a dip in a natural pool at the very top of Sri Lankan's second highest waterfall was epic! The route to this place is long and there's a 45-60mins trek to get to the spot. If your going here for the first time get some local to guide you. Five kilometres east of Koslanda the road passes the 171m-high Diyaluma Falls, Sri Lanka’s third-highest waterfall. Cascading down an escarpment of the Koslanda Plateau, the stream is fairly small, but it quickly escalates after a downpour. The falls leap over a cliff face and fall in one clear drop to a pool below. Traveling between Koslanda and Weliwaya on the small and narrow but scenic A4 stretch will bring you face to face with the beautiful Diyaluma Falls.  dropping from a massive cliff.  Definitely worth stopping and getting your way here to check it out. Fine to drive by but not worth a major diversion. In these hills there are many arresting views and this is but one. We stopped for five mins and on we went... Again a SL attraction that I personally do not find particularly attractive. Yes, nice waterfall. But the approach is difficult. No stairs, lots of floating garbage and pesky vendors that try to peddle their stuff. I don't buy stuff out of principle, so they tried the coin scam on me. His daughter was collecting coins and only the 2 Euro coin was missing. Could watch the falling water for ages. Unfortunately waterfalls are next to the road and there is not much place to sit, relax and see time pass by. They are down a narrow bumpy road,  but worth the trip. We visited them on our way from Horton Plains to Udawalawe. Well worth  a visit. In September when I visited the waterfall, the stream was fairly small.  Probably, at the end of the rain season the falls will  be more spectacular.  It is a short walk from the road, about 200 meters.  The path and steps to the waterfall are in excellent condition. It is not the most impressive waterfall I've  seen, but worth a visit.  So if you are passing by, go and have a look.  Entrance price =150 LKR. Roadside falls that are a welcome relief in the heat. If you are brave enough you can have a little dance in the spray or a wash but just standing at the viewing platform is as good as anything. Easy to get to from welawaya or koslanda on the A4 but take some time to find a car service who can take you to the top as there is a fabulous walk along the hill tops. Beautiful waterfall that will brighten your day and make you smile Height 220m. Second Highest waterfall in sri lanka. Located in dry zone. A4 road between Koslanda and wellawaya (205-206)km I have heard about this waterfalls, but was under the impression that this was even smaller than Dunhinda. So I was not interested in visiting this before. Last week I went there with my wife, and was surprised seeing the beauty of it. It is reasonable that people saying that this is the most beautiful waterfalls in Sri Lanka; but unfortunately there are no Cameras that could capture the real beauty of it with the wind and the mist with the real feeling when you be there for real. If you do not see any specialty when you just watch its photographs, I would recommend you to visit the place and experience it with your own eyes. I guarantee that you would agree with me then. One of the most beautiful waterfalls in Sri-Lanka, its really nice during the rainy season, but even in the drought water trickles by. Well worth a visit. This is a nice waterfall in between Koslanda and Wellawaya, by the side of an undulated road. Access to this place is not convenient and not worth unless passing the area on your way to some other place. What a amazing place in Sri lanka... wooowwww....  very nice waterfall. And also very calm surrounded area. No words to say about this place and this natural waterfall. Sri Lankans are very lucky to had this waterfall. I love  it.... Beautifull waterfall, very good distance from Kandy and nice walk. The view is fantastic en great, nature of Sri Lanka is superb! Okay this place was free with an amazing up close view of the falls. If you are in shape you can climb to get closer to the falls and bathe.... Great pictures and yes some monkeys... We passed this waterfall at the end of the mansoon period and because of the rain more water thundered down as usual. Because of the height and the wind the water falls everytime in a different direction downwards. Enjoy the few with a nice lunch or just a drink at the closeby Diyaluma Falls Inn We made a detour from Wellawaya in our rental car and were not disappointed. The waterfall is beautiful! It's a quiet place, so you can enjoy a picknick without being bothered by local people or crowds of touristst. On this topic we read other comments of other people who made a walk to the top of the falls. When you have time, try it. The waterfalles are on the edge of the escparment and the views into the lowlands must be great. The Diyaluma falls are well worth seeing in all seasons but are incredibly powerful and dramatic after seasonal rains. The local environment is very beautiful and it is wonderful to watch the water crashing down on to the rocks with a backcloth of trees and mountains. A bridge at the foot of the falls is a very popular tourist stopping place and there are several places within walking distance to purchase drinks and snacks. This is a really a marvel of mother nature . Great view .Jungle behind the waterfall .It is about 10 minutes walk from Diyaluma falls inn. love the climate .sensational climate.Had a wonderful time over there I have passed by this water fall many times & am sad to see it at this state as it is approx 10% of what it used to be. The food / tea kiosk at the bridge are far from clean. We managed to patronize a restaurant approx 400 meters down the road towards Wellawaya which had a clean toilet & offered decent food. The picture shown is definitely not of Diyaluma. I am having my adventure treks to this place more that 10 times a year, and therefore can vouch for the inaccuracy. TASK ADVENTURE organizes treks to upper diyaluma with or without an abseiling point before the exact point that the fall is shooting its water cannon to the ground which is 628 feet below. An adrenaline pumping view. With TASK ADVENTURE the safety is not an issue as they are equipped with everything needed. Very beautiful waterfall that will make you go wow specially during the rainy season. Truly a marvel of mother nature. Good place to have a bath as well Even in the dry season, when we were there, these falls are very special.  The drop is 220 meters   and when the falls reach the road, they flow in many directions over large boulders. The waterfall offers really great views both from the bottom and the top. It's not an easy walk but it is worth it, especialy because you can take an awesome bath in the pools at the top. Definitely recommend it! Good fun to climb to the top pool where you can take a dip with the locals. Its a bit of a scramble to the top but its worth it. We were passing and stopped for a bit. Glad we didn't make a special effort. Bandarakwela falls was much better. i and my family had a thoroughly enjoyable trip to this 170 m high waterfall . it is about 14 km from the hilly town of Haputale. The view moving out of the this town is captivating as it is situated on a ridge .  the bus trip from Haputale to the Diyaluma falls takes 45 minutes., going towards welawaya. The falls is  situated by the roadside with sprays falling onto the road . we took a walk thru the rubber plantation with many village homes enroute. there is a few paths leading up but one can always ask the village folks.  A young boy of 12 years became our guide and he is really well informed and fun to be with. we walked up  through temperate shrub land for about 45 minutes with many stops along the way to enjoy the views . At  the top it was pristine and gives a top of the world feeling looking down at the massive falls below.  many small falls are scattered around and provided much fun for my teenage childrem.  One can choose to explore further inland following the river but it was too tiring. there are  villagers selling coconuts and food  at the bottom of the falls. This beautiful waterfall is just by the side of the road and is Sri Lanka's third highest waterfall.  The waterfall was full of water when we went and there was a spray of mist as you walk past !  Although the drive from beragala to diyaluma was lovely , the road surface was rutty making it a bumpy ride ! Second tallest waterfall in Sri Lanka. If you like to be more adventurous, try the Poonagala -Koslanda route from Bandarawela to see this waterfall Its a more scenic route through the tea estates. Recommend a four-wheel vehicle if you decide on this route. It was not in full force when we passed everytime we returned to the Living Heritage hotel.  But still very beautiful. We went to the Diyaluma falls to stay at the Inn next to the falls after seeing the beautiful pictures on the website. The views here are absolutely stunning. However after taking a look around the Inn we were so put off even the views werent enough to make us stay at the Diyaluma Falls Inn. The proprietor has to seriously consider  a makeover of the place to have any one stay there. The toilets are dripping and dirty and the rooms are dingy and musty. It was a real pity to see the place as the location is absolutely brilliant. Really pretty falls..but seriously dodgy rest house right beside it.",4.6,209,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/15/fe/50/be/today-lovely-tour-diayluma.jpg?w=700&h=400&s=1,0.0,42.94117647058823,4.705882352941177,1.1764705882352942,16.470588235294116,34.705882352941174
Elephant Pass,"Elephant Pass. Our recent visit to the Elephant Pass memorial site, where the terrorist bulldozer was destroyed by Hasalaka Gamini, was a deeply moving and meaningful experience. This place stands as a powerful reminder of courage, sacrifice, and the high price paid for peace in Sri Lanka. Seeing the remains of the bulldozer and learning about the bravery displayed during that historic moment gave us a profound sense of respect and gratitude for the soldiers who defended the nation. The site is simple yet impactful, allowing visitors to reflect quietly on the events that took place. It is well worth visiting for anyone interested in Sri Lankan history, especially those who wish to understand the realities faced during the conflict years. A visit here is not just sightseeing—it is a moment of remembrance and appreciation. Highly recommended for those traveling through Elephant Pass. Keeps an important place for itself with respect to the civil war. The history behind this place is mind blowing considering one of the recent battles of the 21st century having taken place here. Fascinating place. Good bird watching. We ate breakfast at the cafe and enjoyed the hstorical backdrop. A memorial dedicated for one of the greatest ever war heros and the first recepiant of Parama Weera Vibhushaya Copral Gamini Kularatne. Also this is the only place in Sri Lanka where you can clearly witness the sunrise & sunset... Quite a historic place. Learning the history about how a war once took place here was very interesting. A landmark in the 30 year civil war history of Sri Lanka I got the feeling climbing up the monument the gravity of the moment, the remembrance of lives lost to bring peace into this land. Do climb!!! A geographically interesting narrow isthmus which carries the railway and the A9 road into Jaffna and was of strategic importance militarily during the Civil War between the Sri Lankan forces and the Tamil Tigers. As such it has now become a war memorial. There is a small restaurant with reasonable toilets, maintained by the Army. The modernised railway station is nearby. In spite of the name there are no elephants on the pass itself. Well worth a stop and to spend 30 minutes to read about the national war hero and to visit his memorial to his heroic actions. A true hero fell. As you pass through, given its importance as the main link between the Jaffna peninsula and the mainland, you are busy clicking away! The whole A9 experience was amazing.  Elephant pass to me came live after all those years of reading of it and washing it in the news. This place holds significance for the millennials of Sri lanka. Historical site on the way to Jaffna.  Very well attended by visitors.  Toilets and food stop as well. One of the memorials remaining from 30 year war held in the area. The place is well maintained and situated next to the Elephant Pass Railway Station. A good place to visit and can see the history war of SriLanka and all are one has flag and the symbols too Worth a stop - this memorial is very well presented with an easy sloping access path.  There are toilets here too! Named thus by the British who brought their elephants up through this area, it is near to where the last big battle for control was fought between the Tamil Tigers and Government troops during the civil war. It is also near to the the armoured bull dozer which threatened to blow up a large number of defenders was halted due to the bravery of one NCO in the Sri Lanka government forces. I do not encourage to spend time here. It was an space where both Sinhala & Tamile people died in the war time. Sinhala people who go on trips to Jaffna become sad and Tamil people who go for their daily work become angry when they pass Elephant passage. If you go to Jaffna - which I highly recommend - don't go by bus. Take the midday train from to Jaffna. Don't worry, even the third class is comfortable just find a nice seat and enjoy the view. Everything will be changing around you: from the lush green rainforest to the dark blue waters of the lagoons. From thick jungle vegetation to coconut palms lining the horizon. Finally, as you cross the famous ""Elephant Pass"" in the late afternoon, the sun slowly sets over the beautiful lagoon and the sky is in flames. Magical. Recently there has been great renovation work done to this area.  We just traveled though it - its getting there and is going to be a great tourist place.  Even so I noted that people are using the area for their special wedding pictures.  It has a relaxing effect, strange really when you know all the meaning that it had during the recent war. It's worth stopping by here on the A9 road to see the Victory monument.  It is not surprisingly, but sadly, triumphalist of the government victory in the civil war.  Maybe a few years' reflection would have been wise in order to create a monument with a more conciliatory message...  Across the road is a much more interesting monument and interpretation in memory of a lone soldier who gave his life to protect many others. The sunset over the waters of the lagoon is just awesome. The sillouhetted palmyrah palm fronds was classically pictorial. Google the sunset time and get there 15mns ahead or you will miss it as it sets v fast. The water bodies on two sides is unusual and interesting. I was told that you can watch both sunrise and sun set here but did not have time to watch either. It had been a place of interest as far as the military strategists are concerned and articles had been published on Elephant pass in the highly respected Jane;s Defense Weekly on the fratricidal wars in Sri Lanka. The term Elephant pass seems to be a suspect translation of some Tamil or Sinhala term since the terrain does not appear to have anything to do with elephants. This is located in A9 . Must visit by every sri Lankan. This co-commemorate the  war heroes of the war ended. This is a place where everyone should pay a visit no matter where you are from. Please pay attention and have good behavior while visiting for this is a place which deserves highest respect. Please remember to talk to a soldier. They are always near the place to guide you through. They will explain the meaning and the importance. Please refrain from taking photos in any manner which can cause disrespect to the monument. This was a different part of Sri Lanka. Flat, open, dry with very warm winds blowing from the sea. It reminded me more of South Australia than Sri Lanka. The monument is a bit forgettable. This monument sits by the side of the road  out of Jaffna just before you actually get to Elephants Pass. It's hard to remember that the warfare between the LTTE/ Tamil Tigers and the Sri Lankan government has only been over for 9 years and matters have been resolved but still political issues have to be worked on. But this monument is a reminder that Sri Lanka is one country again and that the army, navy and airforce all played a role in achieving the eventual resolution which pushed the LTTE out. Much of the countryside around the monument has been cleared, to ensure there was no cover for the armies. After heavy bloodshed this is a reminder of the essential nature of peace and unity. It was very busy when we visited due to this being the Sunday of a Poya weekend. 20/30 minutes would be appropriate. This iconic monument represents the glory of Sri Lankan armed forces. Its built having a few huge bronze hands holding a model of the country, surrounded by bandoleer-wearing lions. This also immortalizes the memories of fierce gun battles fought by our war heroes and the immense sacrifices they have made. Elephant Pass is the bottleneck gateway to Jaffna peninsula which was under LTTE's control since April 2000. This was captured by Sri Lankan armed forces in January 2009, which was a significant milestone of the liberation of the country from the civil war that lasted for 30 years. Read the history of the area befor you visit.we Found intresting once we know the story of war heros. Elephant is just 10-15kms away from Jaffna. Elephant pass is well known for its war memorial statue of our great hero Hasalaka Gamini. True hero who sacrifices his life for the nation. Sri lanka Army's one of the main military base. this a place must visit and see. One of the attraction place to remember the 30 years Civil war . please keep clean this place. It's a great place to be while you are on the way to Jaffna. There is a war memorial and the surrounding Lagoon is great to watch. this place has in many ways to dis crib. 01. war memorial statue ( important military base ) 02. sri lankan neack ( in the gateway of Jaffna Peninsula.) 03. one & only place can see sun risen & sun down 04.island's largest salt field ( natual curdle salt from jan-apr temperature) It’s a very emotional place for Sri Lankans. Built in memory of the 54 th Brigade of the Sri Lanka Army. The entire brigade has sacrificed their lives for the sake of the country. Show the tanker that was used in the war between the Tamils and the government. It depicts the sacrifice of a soldier to prevent the destruction of a site. Small  area Many tourists who opt to explore the north are interested in the history and legacy of the war. Crossing from Jaffna to the peninsula through Elephant Pass is the way to begin explore the devastation. We were fortunate to find a terrific guide for that purpose. His name is Mohan and he is a very pleasant and knowledgeable person, with immaculate English and a first-hand experience with the war years, He may be contacted through vishmohan71 at yahoo.com. Highly recommended for those, like us, interested in the details of the conflict and its results, and willing to spend a full long day moving among various relevant sites on the peninsula. This place is a sobering reminder of the fact that no one wins in war. War has left much destruction, still evidence of bunkers and   few services. Plan your fuel stops in advance. The memorial to the Sri Lankan soldier is a fantastic monument and designed with great thought. Enjoyed going around the memorial. The station and the JCB that was ultimately destroyed is a reminder of the days gone by. Finally one country with no war - they call this the Peace Memorial which is very appropriate. Multiple ethnicities finally living in harmony !! Elephant's Pass is a very important area for the final moments of the war. However, it was very unfortunate that only the winner's side of the story is told at Elephant's Pass. It is very pro-Sri Lankan Army and does not offer another side to the story of the War. It doesn't focus on the struggles of the Tamil minority and Tamil Tiger soldiers who suffered a lot as well. Went there in the evening and could see the best view of the most narrow part of the country. There was an Army personnel to explain the background of the monument and his speech made us get goose bumps and tears. From Jaffna we took the train to Elephant pass. This is a great option. As you are at the northern limits of the line you get a seat. It is a hard journey all the way south but we changed to our bus for more comfort beyond this point. The place has an interesting history so give it a try. If you are in a bus you simply pass through! This strech connects jaffna to the mainland and is worth a visit to view the surroundings.  .  Also to visit the memorial for a very bravel soldier who offered his life to save his comrades during the past civil war Elephant Pass is effectively a causeway linking the Jaffna peninsular to the south and was fiercely fought over by the LTTE (Tamil Tigers) and Sri Lankan army during the civil war. This history is marked by 2 interesting memorials on opposite sides of the road (but a short distance part). The first (on the left going north on the A9) is a memorial to 26 year old Corporal Gamini Kularathna who had the presence of mind to use grenades to stop the advance of an armour plated bulldozer (present on site) heavily laden with explosives. He gave his own life to save many of his comrades. There is a statue of Gamini with the bulldozer in front and a nearby exhibition space with lots of photographs, personal letters and other documents. Nearby is the recently rebuilt Elephant Pass station. Looking at the timetable, and the interval between trains, it is difficult to see who would actually use the station. All part of the civil war and reconciliation effort. Further up the A9 on the right is a 2nd 'reconciliation' monument which marks the resumption of free movement between north and south. The symbolism of various parts of the monument, including plant species from north and south, is explained in a series of plaques. This is very recent history and it is noticeable that many Sri Lankans are visiting the Jaffna peninsular and a part of their country which for many years was out of bounds. It is a world away from the Cultural Triangle, Hill Country and beautiful beaches but for a complete look at Sri Lanka should not be missed. The location is nice where you need to go on a lengthy bridge. We travelled in early morning and with the sunset, the horizon was amazing. And the memorial is located in one edge of the bridge. Major landmark in Sri Lanka. Great place to see. Very beautiful place.  A must-see for anybody. Great history lies here, On tour way to jafnna you have to pass elephant pass (if you are taking A9 Road which is the main road to jaffna). This has been a strategic location as elephant pass connects jaffna peninsula and the rest of the country. Known to connect thebhead of the Sri Lanka with the body. ( If you see the sri lanka map you would know what this means) There is an army officer who explains everything what happened at thisnplace and how Sri Lanka forces lost and won the place back to tamil tigers. Do not miss there are two locations just by the road to see. Both memorials are of importance. Also the army officer informed the cleanest water in sri lanka can be found here and there are tanks which you can try as well. You can spend about 30minutes to one hour here. This is a must visit place for all Sri Lankans to remind ourselves of the great sacrifices that were done here to safeguard the country and bring peace to the nation. the war memorial and the memorial honouring Copral Gamini and well kept and maintained . The entry point to Jaffna peninsula, the key bases of the Sri Lankan army and the place currently holds a memorial statue of a war hero who sacrificed his life to save the camp. Nice peaceful surroundings. A nice place for a quick refreshing stop. Elephant pass connects Jaffna and the rest of Sri Lanka by just a road and the rest is beautiful calm sea. It is a beautiful sight.  This place holds the monument which was erected with the liberation of the North. It also holds another monument of a young heroic soldier who sacrificed his life to save the entire army camp, by hurling a grenade to a suicide tanker rolling towards the camp., and destroying it. A monument in the time-honoured tradition of celebrating victories.  Don't waste your time on this, unless you are a fan of pompous war monuments. this is a significant site in the civil war struggle; it commemorates the bravery of one young soldier, but also brings home the futility of war; quite solemn, quite hot too ! A reminder of three decade war which ravaged the North and the South dividing the Sinhalese fronm the Tamils. This memorial is built to remind us of those heroic forces which unified the country from the clutches of terrorism. I went  back to see it from Jaffna tuk tuk. Beautiful kept grounds n gardens  saw the statue  had refreshing drink 🍹 in the cafe  beside it During the war both sides seem to have form for wrecking everything the other lot built including war graves. This monument stands beside the main road and represents the government having the last word. There were no other visitors around when we climbed to the top but a jobsworth still made our driver move the car a few yards. Great views of the wetlands, and the birds that exist in the area. Great landscape. The memorial is biased, but interesting to note. Take your time and stop here on your way to Jaffna its right off the highway. From the top of the monument there's a great view over the landscape and remember the lives lost in the devastating civil war not many years ago. Sri Lanka is doing great coming back in it's feet.. this is the land mark for the victory of the war memorial.we all must salute for this.nice place to visit while travelling to jaffna This place was one of the key bases of the Sri Lankan army and the place currently holds a memorial statue of a war hero who sacrificed his life (Corprol Gamini) to save the camp. The place has documentary of war. This is in the main road it self with very easy access. Since there is not much time to waste to see this, believe this is a must visit place The beach is not as amazing as it is made  out to be. It is full of debris, rubbish and do not have adequate parking. Nothing compared to beachs in other Asian countries(cleanliness and beauty). There is a War Memorial and Memorial Statue of Hasalaka Gamini the Copral who wan awarded the Parama Weera Wibushana for his great work done for the Country. the feeling of visiting this place is speechless I recommend this to every traveler to visit an see it Elephant Pass Northern Province, Sri Lanka is located in the gateway of Jaffna Peninsula. Elephant pass is the place could be the entrance to the North aria of the country. *.  Elephant Pass has been a strategic military base since 1760, when the Portuguese built a fort, which was later rebuilt and garrisoned by the Dutch in 1776[1] and later by the British. A modern military base was built there in 1952 by the Sri Lankan Army (SLA). At one time, the base and its outlying camps expanded to cover an area 23 Km. (14 mi) long and 8 Km. Since the war ended, when people live in freedom in Sri Lanka, it is fortunate. very beautiful place. srilankan army won the war in northern. i just thanks to them. this place be in on the way to a9 road. Covered by the lagoon both the sides and a historical place in Sri Lanka. This place could be the entrance to the North aria of the country. This is a good place if you're interested in the history of the area. I would suggest googling it before you go and reading up on what happened at Elephant Pass (try to avoid the propaganda takes on it). This location has yet another war monument put up by the Rajapaksa government. I took a bus there and walked across the pass. It's a nice walk, although when I got to the other end it took a while for a bus to come and pick me up so I was left sitting in the hot sun for a while. So maybe just plan it better than I did. Elephant pass is the point which connects the Jaffna peninsula and the main land. This place you can witness the connection between the Sea and the Lagoon. A memorial icon that need to be listed as a tourist attraction in Jaffna This is a journey not just of distance, it landscape one to be seen. As the lagoon   cross, the land and  the surrounding vegetation changes trees disappear. palmyrah trees, standing tall. It connects the peninsula to the Sri Lankan mainland. Elephant Pass has been a strategic military post in the North of Sri Lanka since 1760 when the Portuguese, Dutch and later The British developed military camps in this region. However more recently during the Sri Lankan Civil War (between 1983 - 2009) a memorial to Corporal Gamini Kularatne who advanced the end of the Civil War, by sacrificing his life and single handedly stopping the advance of a reinforced bulldozer tank armed by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam -  Tamil Tigers, which were advancing towards a small group / platoon of the Sri Lankan Army. Suddenly Lance Corporal Kularatne, holding two grenades in his hands, dashed out towards the oncoming bulldozer tank, clambered up the tank's ladder and tossed the two grenades inside it, disregarding the numerous injuries he himself had suffered by then from the bullets of LTTE. Within seconds, fiery bursts of fire accompanied by a series of explosions occurred. Lance Corporal Gamini Kularatne was flung to the ground and lay motionless.  Sadly he died in this act of Heroism. In recognition of his act of gallantry Lance Corporal Gamini Kularatne was promoted to the rank of Corporal posthumously and honored with the award of ""Parama Weera Vibhushanaya"" on 10 October 1991, the highest gallantry award in Sri Lanka for the first time in the history of Sri Lanka Army. A very interesting part of the history of Sri Lanka that we could have missed but we are pleased that we didn't. Elephant pass is on the main road from Jaffna to Trincamalee / Kandy so no need to divert, the memorial is a fitting tribute to Corporal Gamini Kularathne who sacrificed his life to save the garrison and is a Sri Lankan national hero. An important story that seems lost in the big statue and lack of maintenance. The toilets whilst having a large sign are closed and not functioning.  The tank/bulldozer story a few yards away is much more interesting and well displayed Two war memorials very close together, provide a poignant reminder of past events, with some information about the war. Enroute Jaffna to Kandy on A9 you would drive pass a painful reminder of the many battles fought here during the Civil War of Sri Lanka, the Elephant Pass. The war memorial was not elaborate though the view of Jaffna lagoon was quite scemic. Nothing much else there. The drive on the causeway is pretty. The military victory monuments are jarring. The ""war memorial"" like most others in the North does not honor the thousands of lives lost in Sri Lanka's most bloody war in history. A painful and distasteful reminder of the futility and glorification of war by the victor. Artistically as well not the greatest piece of work. It's the only one place in the world you can watch sun rise and sun down (except kanya kumari at india). This is the narrowest place in sri lanka. Historical place but nothing special to see. We just got a stop there with the taxi on our way from Jaffna to Mullaitivu and Trincomalee by the costal road I always feel a thrill crossing Elephant Pass. Not sure why, perhaps after reading the book of same name.  Interesting history and well maintained. Cannot enter Jaffna without passing, so, easily done. Good place of interest, main attraction for locals always willing to chat about there experiences of the war. this memorial is built to remember all the victims during the civil war. Every item has a meaning and the guiding soldiers are very willing to explain all this to you. It contains beautiful carvings that tell the war-and-peace story in a perfect balanced way. The highest steps are forbidden for tourists. Only the persons who can prove to be related to a war victim are allowed to step up to put flowers, memorial candle or to pray. An important place in the recent war history of Sri Lanka. Probably polarising, depending on which side you were on during the war. I felt sad for all the lives lost here in the defence of territory, be they Sri Lankan forces or terrorists. Reminders like Elephant Pass are important, so that such terrible wars never happen in Sri Lanka again. Important place in the map of Sri Lanka, war memories, memorials, has become more historic in the recent times, over the 30 year war in Sri Lanka If you are traveling to Jaffna on A9, you will pass ElephantPass. On your pass take your time to visit both war monument and the memorial. The morning sunrise is stunning. There is also a mini museum in the memorial with many remaining artifacts of Hasalaka Gamini, the war hero who gave up his life to protect his camp. Also some photos and videos are on display showing the brutality of the civil war that took place in Sri Lanka. Elephant pass has had its long and bloody history over the course of the Sri Lankan civil war with many brave men killed in action while defending a strip of land which holds the way to the north. It is worth stopping by to look around and you can head on to the war memorial (please be respectful when taking pictures). Elephant pass is essentially a land bridge with the sea all around it with the sun rise and set being clearly visible. I know it sounds odd but try the water from here. the natural filtering in the salty environment gives the water a strangely sweet and refreshing taste. We can discuss if you like or dislike the monument. It’s not my style, but still we visited it because it’s part of the recent history of Sri Lanka. When you love Sri Lanka, like we do, just stop, visit the monument and think about the pain this island nation has endured. And it’s everybody’s responsibility that it will not occur again, so all the people in Sri Lanka can live in peace. Stopped at the rest stop for lunch. Pretty basic Sri Lankan food in silver pans. Lots of flies and bloody hot, really appears like no mans land This narrow bit of land is an amazing place to stop and look around the monuments. To think that this place could have been completely destroyed by Tamil Tiger terrorists.. The reverence the Hsalaka hero is held with is amazing to witness and the gratefulness for him saving the camp can be felt every where around the memorial. Apart from the great significance when defeatign the terrorists, it is also a beautiful area well worth spending some time on your way to the Northern peninsula. It would benefit from improved facililties such as a decent cafe and better toilets. What a change. This was a strong hold of LTTE, and their defeat by the SriLankan army is written all over with various monuments. The roads and railway tract are back in much better condition. An emotional site to visit The Elephant Pass is on the road for Jaffna. You would not go there specifically but you would pass on your way to the North. It was fascinating to see this place which we had only seen in photographs & maps, the roads have been renovated well after the war so it was no problem for travellers. You need to drive on this narrow piece of land to get to Jaffna.  Its strewn with war memorabilia. Many a battle fought over this narrow isthmus that connects the mainland with jaffna Sri Lanka's North has many attractions and a quality of its own, in its people, the exotic sea foods and how they prepare the tasty dishes, the hindu and Christian places of worship, the nagadeepa temple, its hospitality. The exciting part is whether you travel by road or by train, this is the isthmus that connects the northern peninsula with all its treasures to the south, a narrow long strip of land traversed by the roadway and rail track side by side. This logical gate for Jaffna and South this place just the road for many of travellers but how live in Srilanka knows that important this place when the war going Its a narrow shape land heading to the jaffna peninsula and can see idian ocean from both side of yours.....and its a welknown place for local army camp and battles held with ltte.....now ita almost a place to memories the war hearos and specillay a person who sacrifices his life for others called as hasalaka gamini...... Recently the place developed and more monuments added....recommend to visit any of travellers.... This is the area connecting mainland Sri Lanka, with the Jaffna Peninsula. It is a narrow strip of land with water on both sides. It was an important area when terrorists, used to occupy Jaffna peninsula. You expect a fabulous pass, but it is just a causeway between lagoons. Nothing special despite the historical significance. Elephant Pass, in the Northern Province of Sri Lanka is the gateway to Jaffna Peninsula. A9 road and railway line on causeway provide easy access to the Jaffna peninsula. From the entrance to the memorial everything found has a meaningful description. Starting from the plants on both sides of the memorial. North side of the memorial from the entrance is decorated with plants of North and southern side with southern plants and so on. There will be a solder belonging to Sri Lanka Army, who will brief the tourists with the values and history of elephant pass and the description of the memorial. Further, don't miss to find out about the water well situated near the memorial, which is known as the well which have the best water in Sri Lanka(This was told to us by the Solder who did the briefing) Just a causeway in a key location. It is the gateway to the north and Jaffna. Little else to say except that there is water on both sides This is the Lagoon pass crossing the A9 road and the views around this areas is mesmirising. After the completion/rennovation of A9 road the attraction further increased and people do visist this area or even stop while passing through to see the beauties around. We took the Jaffna train through Elephant pass and it is really nothing but a causeway between two places. It is also the one of the places mentioned in the novel 'the road from elephant pass' written by Nihal de silva who was subsequently killed by a land mine in wilpatu park. The book basically gives both sides of the conflict in sri lanka. But for the average person Elephant pass is nothing special. This is the entry point  to Jaffna. During the conflict time, it was a critical point for the parties to capture to enter/ defend the Jaffna I passed Elephantpass on the way to to Jaffna. We stopped at the monument of Corp. Gamini Kularathne from Hassalaka and observed one minute silence to respect him. When he was duty at the centry point of his camp LTTE tried to over run the camp by bringing the huge bulldozer which was covered with bullet proof metal sheaths. When he found that they could not stopped it he ran with grenades and climbed up and blew the driving compartment. He had enough gun fire yet he ran and achieved his target. By this self motivated act without any orders he destroyed this bulldozer there by saved his camp and comrades.  But he paid the supreme sacrifice for the nation. Mother Sri lanka will be always prod of this son and he was first to be honoured with  PARAMA VEERA WIBUSHANA gallantry medal. Before the conflict started, Elephant Pass is just a Police check point to check the lorries plying between Jaffna peninsula and Colombo. Afterwords Army camp established here. When the war started between Army and LTTE, step by step this camp got bigger and bigger. In 1990's LTTE try to over run this garrison, but army successfully beaten back, killing more than 600 attackers. Undisclosed number of army personal also killed. After that, time to time clashes occurred around this area with casualties. Again in 2000's LTTE made a fierce attack and over run this camp with lost of thousands of lives. Finally in 2009 Army crushed the LTTE and captured back the whole area. Now this bridge symbolically connect the Nothern Jaffna peninsula and the Southern Main land. Recently I travelled through this bridge, then I remember all these! I think every body live in Jaffna peninsula and traveled through Elephant Pass can feel the same. This is a unique isthmus that joins South Sri Lanka to the Jaffna peninsula. The vast lagoon is on either side.The new Jaffna Railway line runs alongside parallel to the main roadway the A 9. It would be a photographers delight if one is lucky  to capture a picture when a train is crossing the Pass. We expected more of Elephant Pass but it's just a road through the Jaffna Lagoon. Not spectacular. The only thing you'll see is lots of water and birds. visited this place and found to have built a commemoration place for Sri lankan Army war heroes. This has been a strategic point for the Sri Lanka army and the monuments there shows the old memories. The Salt Flats and the causeway - signify the entrance to the Peninsular - and we stopped at the memorial to the Soldier who saved the Camp of 600 by sacrificing his life. The memorial area is well maintained with a  small museum. All worth a visit. During a 30 year bloody war against ruthless terrorists who killed thousands of civilians in North, East and South there were so many unnamed war heroes. Hasalaka Gamini is one that Sri Lankan know of. He sacrificed his life to  safeguard a major camp during the war. This monument is for him and also many others. On my way to Jaffna from Colombo on World famous A9 road , i discovered beautiful Elephant Pass. One time there was no access on this route for motor vehicles. But now its 100% free access. The causeway across the lagoons is the gateway to Jaffna.  It was the scene of heavy fighting to dislodge the LTTE.  There are two war memorials, one at either end.  The northern monument is a general one remembering the fallen government soldiers of this campaign.  Maybe of more interest to the visitor is the one at the southern end as it commemorates a personal story.  Corporal Gamini disabled a heavily armoured bulldozer packed with explosives at the cost of his own life, thereby saving his comrades.  The bulldozer is preserved on site and the statue of Gamini is honoured by a guard of two sentries who stand to attention beside him on a rota with a guard changing ceremony each hour.  Meanwhile his story is told to the visitors over loudspeakers. If you are visiting Jaffna you will pass by these monuments so it is well worth stopping to see some of Sri Lankas recent history. Elephant Pass is a narrow strip of land which links Jaffna to the rest of the country. It is a wide open space, where there used to be a Fort , destroyed during the war. The road through the Pass is excellent ; the railway line has been rebuilt and will open soon, making the Peninsula even more easily accessible. There are military memorials and monuments along the way, as many important battles were fought in this area. Iranamadu Tank and Chundikulam Bird Sanctuary are nearby. As you approach Jaffna Peninsula, this is a good place to take a break and stretch your legs as the facilities are good. The causeway is repaired and carpeted and the railway line is also being installed parallel. Just passing the cause way you can see the turnoff the Chundikulam bird sanctuary Beautiful site. One of the best places in Jaffna to take some photographs. There is a memorial statue for the fallen soldiers. Unless you read some of the books that describe the things that have happened around the pass it will be not much more than a bridge with a checkpoint. The Elephant pass is a nice stop on the way to Jaffna. You can visit the Army monument, commemorating the fight against LTTE  taken place there on 2009. A soldier is always available for explanations, if you have a guide who can translate. Nice view of the sea on both sides of the pass. We travelled with a Sri Lankan driver and car across this area known as Elephant Pass  on our way to Jaffna. Having heard so much about this area during the troubles we were surprised at how the scenery is so very different from how we imagined. Great expanse of sandy areas and then the lagoon on one side and the Bay of Bengal on the other. Sad to think of the loss of life in this area but rejoice that the troubles are now over, However as UK tourists we were more than surprised that near Omantai we had to go through a military check point and produce our pass ports which they photocopied. This in a country that has been finished with war 4years, We also had to get out of our vehicle and produce our passports on leaving the area two days later. Not the most comfortable feeling to get visitors to the North. I don't think that this area can be rated in a way that you can rate a hotel etc, so hence the average rating Elephant pass is a narrow isthmus joining Jaffna Peninsula to the mainland. It was the biggest salt panes in the country long time back. Portugese followed by Dutch and then British occupied this strategic area and it witnesses several severe episodes of the Sri Lankan civil war. You can see sea on both sides which make you feel that you are travelling on a very long bridge.One can see the railway track being laid which is going to be the rail route for the Yaal Devi train connecting Jaffna with Colombo. A historic landmark of Sri Lanka worth seeing. This place was one time military strategic place, there was huge military camp situated here, presently there is only a victory monument placed here. It is situated between Vavunia and Jaffna. If you are passing worth a stop. both side of the road you will find sea it has a nice view, it will be nicer after the rail road is constructed. Great stop off on our way up to Jaffna clean toilets!! Food was fine also. Plenty of people agreed as there were many there.  There were awesome tanks from the recent war full of bullet holes. I think they were call mine explodes, but unsure. It's a place where you can see the vehicles at the last moment of War between Sri Lanka Army and Terrorists. It's nothing to attract anyone, but you get the feeling of proud to be Sri Lankan. It's very hot in the day time. This is one of the places which was damaged during the high time of the war. There is a lot of war related literature with ""Elephant Pass"" as the name.  There is a book named ""The Road from Elephant Pass"". This area has a salt lake and I think that it is currently not in use. A lot of battles have taken place in this area. Once an LTTE truck had come with explosives with the intention of driving directly into the army camp which was situated at Elephant Pass and one soldier named ""Gamini"" (who later came to be known with the name of his village as ""Hasalaka Gamini) has run towards the truck with explosives in his hand and blasted the truck thereby saving all the lives of the soldiers inside the camp. His pictures, a description of the incident and the remains of the LTTE truck are still there to be seen around this area. This is the only place in Sri Lanka where you can see the sun rise AND the sun set! It is a thin strip of land connecting the mainland to the Jaffna Peninsula. The road was under construction in fits and starts on the way to Jaffna and a few check points as well. The Pass has been a strategic military base since the 1700s when the Portuguese built the fort. The man made LTTE Terrorist armoured vehicles and the bulldozer that Lance Corporal Gamini Kularathna confronted and blew up with hand grenades, thereby killing himself in the process are displayed in the area.",4.0,138,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/14/2c/eb/b1/elephant-pass-war-memorial.jpg?w=700&h=400&s=1,0.0,19.83471074380165,8.264462809917356,6.6115702479338845,20.66115702479339,44.62809917355372
Ella Railway Station,"Ella Railway Station. nice small railway station very close to the market place and centrally located in ella ,need to buy a platform ticket to enter , train ride kandy or nuveralia to ella is a must . A small station but no stairs that you have to lug your luggage over which was really nice.  Gets very busy outside the station with almost no parking available.  Lovely station that looks cared for.  Go for a walk on the tracks from here to 9 arch bridge, obviously checking for trains first, but very pleasant walk. Announcements very clear for incoming trains.  Has a bathroom to the right as you enter the station.  Remember to keep your tickets as they do check these when you try and leave the station. Take a train from Ella to Badulla, pass the Nine Arches and photos out of the side of the train. Make sure you hold on tight though! I found Ella to be quite pleasant although the traffic was a bit on the messy side. Be careful of the accommodation you  book as a lot of them may require a bit of climbing. Lots of activities around Ella, so have fun! Some great restaurants there but only picture of one, try it! Great experience of local railways, beautiful countryside, friendly staff; colonial in feel and rolling stock likely from same era…..very memorable. Our group's 'Viceroy Special' train paused here for many minutes to cross (meet) a mixed train (with freight wagons and at the rear, passenger carriages). The station was clean and well looked after. There is at least one kiosk. As usual in Sri Lanka for all but the smallest stations, it is staffed whenever trains are timetabled to stop for passengers. Amazing trip on the train up into the hills for such a small fee. If you're in Sri Lanka you must catch the train through the countryside it's unbelievable. Amazing positive experience on train station in Ella. I lost my wallet at the station in Ella and I got it back the next day, thank's to a very kind station master. Very satisfied with the service and honesty of all employees on the station. If you are getting off at this train stop, take a picture of your ticket. There is a person collecting the tickets from all the passengers when they are leaving the train station. I didn't know that, asked the guy collecting the tickets if I can keep mine as a present, but the guy was unpleasant, didn't even look at me, showing me to leave. I see this place totally prepared for and welcoming tourists. The railway station itself is a nice and historical building. If you enjoy things like that, I recommend to visit the in-between train arrivals. Otherwise the place is too crowded and you just move on your way to the exit with everyone else. Well maintained railway station. Nicely signposted for the carriages. Announcements can actually be understood! Ella has become a very popular destination with the tourists in Sri Lanka. The railway station serves as a major gateway facilitating travel to the popular city.  The station is well maintained and the staff in attendance barring the SM were quite helpful to share details of the attractions nearby. . The station is well organised and clean with plenty of travellers using its facilities.  One of the better stations in Sri Lanka. Its maintained well. Other stations should do the same as Ella station. It looks really good, credit should go the station master. I visited the station as the outside look was amazing. I wanted to go inside and check, but the Officials said no as there was no train coming at that time. They said the platform ticket can be issued only during a trian's arrival time. HHHHMmmm... not only he said that he was very sarcastic about our request.....Strange....... You have to get off this station to see Nine Arch at Ella. You never forget this place ever when you visit Ella ❤️ Built by the British a 100 years ago (1918) the Ella Railway Station (ERS) has original colonial era architecture and is easily one of the most visited single-track mainline railway stations in Sri Lanka. Irrespective of which way you travel from ERS absolute scenic beauty is guaranteed. Travel the 20 km’s towards Badulla (the end of upcountry railway track) and you will ride over the Nine Arch Bride and Pass the Demodara Railway Loop. Ride in the opposite direction towards Idalgashinna Railway Station also 20 km’s away and you will enjoy spectacular views of tea plantations and sleepy mountainous villages. Generally 4 trains pass by ERS during the day and tickets are issued only a short while before each train arrives so make sure to be at the station ahead of time to secure your ticket. There is also a safe vehicle parking area besides the station in case you have to leave behind the vehicle you drive/ride. A lessor known fact is that Sri Lanka Railways (and of course the ERS) is one of the last remaining railway’s in the world to continue to use Edward Tyer's century and half old ingenious tablet signalling system, while other countries have gone on to adopt more advanced radio and electronic signalling methods. If you are interested to take a look at the ‘key token instrument’ get to the station before the rush and have a friendly chat with the station master….I hope he will oblige your request (well I have not asked my self though!) It is basically a normal train ride, like we had many years ago in Europe, packed with people, music, different faces and different smells. If you miss it, you can take the ride. Arrived here at night. Gorgeous little station and easy to pick up a tuktuk outside or walk the short walk into the town Booked a train ride (Viceroy II) from Ella to Kandy, so got to visit this little railway station. Staff service was ok, used the wheelchair for a friend who hurt her leg to wheel her from entrance to the platform. The train arrival was on time -- plus point to such service in Sri Lanka! Enjoyed the ride with the beautiful scenery along the way (6+ hours), mostly tea plantations, valleys, villages, towns, also the historical design of each small stations along the way! The ride was pretty shaky at times (due to the rail), haha. Adorable train station to enjoy before you go on the most beautiful train ride in the world!  The station manager is friendly and helpful, there is an ATM there and lots of Tuk drivers if you wish to avoid the short 1 block walk to town. The train journey is must to do while in Sri Lanka. If you do not have much time then shorten ur train trip. But this is like must. Train with open doors. Train offering amazing views of lush green forests. Get the train tickets earlier & do not get 1st class ticket, get 2nd or 3rd class. The train ride between Kandy and Ella is certainly something you cannot and should not miss. And one of the best part of this train ride is to witness the small, quaint and antique looking railways stations on the way. Let it be hatton, nuwara eliya or Ella. We loved all these small railways stations as much as we loved the train ride. They gave us a feeling of living 40-50 years back in time. The station is very basic but it's in the middle of the nature and you gotta take a picture in front of the train when it is stopped here. Usually the train driver and the station master do not mind tourists taking such pictures but it's always good to ask for permission before jumping on the tracks. My partner and I traveled through the hill country to Ella where our driver picked us up. When the train arrives it’s busy at the station. Plenty of decent restaurants alongside the station. Ella Railway Station is 10 min drive by taxi from the City center. There are not so many trains daily going to Colombo or Kandy each day. The Station is well maintained. Did anybody make the same experience? When buying train tickets at Ella Station we did not get the right change back (3700 instead of 3800 Rs). Not a big deal we thought until we met an Australian guy on the platform afterwards who got only 3050 back instead of 3500. By accident or systematic? When in Sri Lanka, it is a must to do the most scenic train trip in the world. Ella is a great place to start, if heading back towards Kandy. Easy to get to station from town , quick on and off from the train with plenty of Tuk tuks just waiting to take you to your accommodation, Clean and friendly, we were able to upgrade to 2nd class as we arrived very early for our train to Colombo. Nice colonial style buildings with friendly staff. Well maintained and beautiful. There are well maintained toilet facilities. The station has a lovely view of the surroundings. How cool was their to transit from down south to nuwara Eliya.cool mist Breez refresh for better rest We arrived in Ella by train and were surprised to find the area around the station populated by very groovy cafes and stalls. Good vibe. Like all stations we saw on the Tea Train it was clean and decorated with flower posts and colonial charm This railway station clearly has large numbers of passengers.  It provides basic facilities for travellers.  However more is available nearby We went for a walk along the tracks from this quaint old station.  As per all the reviews and suggestions, ignore the sign that says do not walk on the tracks. Had a great walk - met a few others on the tracks. Really beautiful walk. The train station is easy to find. Friendly and efficient staff. They inform passengers if there are delays by posting notices on the ticket office window. We were not able to use toilet facilities at the train station but there are many cafes closeby. We were lucky to watch a cricket match is is right by the station. ONE CANNOT BUY TICKETS WHEN THERE ARE POWERCUTTS WHICH HAPPENS ALMOST EVERYDAY- SO CHECK IF THERE IS ELECTRICITY BEFORE GOING TO THE STATION. Sometimes they ask for your passport. Pretty pretty railway station.  plenty of flowers and Olive tree ..........  my family & I were allowed to just sit there to rest on our return from Hikes without platform tickets ...... Siriwardene was a nice guy ..... It is just the station, however it is common that people go to Ella by long train ride. We had the ride from Nuwara Eliya. It was extremely crowded train, crowded by locals and more tourists, and it was so funny experience, and the views along the way were pretty. Obviously, this review is not about a station, but about a journey from Nani Oya to Ella by train. Tickets are quite hard to come by and it is better to ask a travel agent to get them for you as reserved seats go on sale 30 days before the date and have to be picked up in person. I would also advise taking first class seats because you have more space to move around and see the views. Our tickets cost 1000 rupees each, less than £5 for a two and a half hour journey. The views are fabulous: waterfalls, hills, cliffs, paddy fields, tea plantations, small villages and tiny railway halts decorated with scores of flower pots. Just sit back, Elam and enjoy the views! Pretty enough little railway station with some nice features but, fundamentally, just a railway station. Apparently it regularly wins the best kept station award, which is nice. Do not take the taxi from there. Just walk. It is like..400 meters and you are in the city already. The taxi drives ask you 200-400 locals (1-2 euros) and it is pointless to pay. As we arrived in Ella by Minibus we saved ourselves the joy of stepping out of the carriage onto the platform at this station. A much better experience was seeing it from the railway lines as we walked from the Nine Arches Bridge. Signs do say not to walk on the railway lines but the view of the building trackside and without the mad rush experienced by others was more meaningful. Its a standard Sri Lanka Railway station, busy with a horde of tourists.  Interestingly the locals, tourists and officials all ignore to 'Prohibited to walk on Tracks' signs....as did we Be in time if you want to book train tickets. Long queus and waiting times. Prepare your train travels in general and book tickets ahead if you want granted a seat, otherwise you will have to stay up. We went from Ella to Haputale to visit Lipton Seat. This was only one hour travel but as always train over crowded. It us a special experience so do go by train! Book first class tickets long time before your travel schedule. The place is old and uninteresting - the toilet is dirty - be prepared. We came by train and also walked from 9 arches Understanding and being understood can be difficult. We traveled from Ella to Bandula just to experience the train. I understand the train can be very highly rated. I am sorry to say I do not agree. It was overcrowded and rough by 3rd class and difficult to see any of the view. There are 2 types of trains one red and one blue I believe the red is the roughest class and that is what I road. You may have a better experience on the blue. Get there early, sharpen your elbows and chuck British politeness out of the window. Alternatively risk standing for 7 hours, on a beautiful, but hot, jolty train, squished in with tourists and locals alike. We were lucky, we arrived an hour before and got a set of tickets. Mrs Johnson was tasked with seat grabbing. She is a habbbitual London commuter, so her area of expertise. Me with, our two rucksacks, was to follow on. Great made plans of mice and men will often go awry, and the train door to the 2nd class carriage stopped but feet away from me, leaving Mrs J blindsided. A scrabble emerged, my weight of 100kg plus two 25kg bags, front and rear, made a formidable force, sending many Europeans flying as I entered the train behind one other. And thank god I did, we got the last two seats and therefore secured our tenure for the 7 hours to Kandy. The view is beautiful. If you can, sit on the right hand side from Ella to Nuwara Elliya and the left side thereafter to Kandy, if you are fortunate enough to have a choice. You will get views in any case if you don't get that option, but for full exposure this is the best way to do it. A string of merchants peddling everything from fresh fruit to deep fried salty snacks push through, baskets on their heads, malevolently scolwing at the tourists they scatter on their mission, followed shortly by yet more chaps with cold drinks and coffee. Don't think for one moment that the exit at Kandy is any easier, as this isn't the last stop, Colombo is. Therefore, as you are pulling yourself from 7 hours in a jauntilly angled chair, you will be ambushed left right and centre as the train stops, by those wishing to secure your perch for the next leg. A mad scrabble ensued, made easier by my significant belly of 21 days rice, curry and Lion Larger and we landed, unceremoniously, on the platform, to a throng of delighted tuk tuk drivers waiting for us and therefore their next fare. One tip, overheard from a man with an impressive beard and even more impressive shirt: take a tuk tuk an hour or so from Ella, they are cheap so no concern there, to the origination point of the train, Badulla. Far from the madding throng of tourists, you will be guaranteed not only a seat, but a choice of seat and no fisty cuffs with fellows at Ella Station. You will also sail over the acclaimed nine arch Bridge, therefore adding another layer of excellence to this already exciting journey. We took the scenic train from Ella to Nuwara Eliya. It's totally reminiscent of the green trains in old day China, from the small scenic train station, to the punchable tickets, to the peddlers getting on and off in between stations. Brings back childhood memories. Nice and clean station, be early to catch a ticket and a nice seat. Schedule is shown outside of the station and keep your ticket, you need to show on your final destination, otherwise you have to pay a fine. Place to get boarded on famous Ella-Kandy train ride. Nothing exceptional great, just cute little station with amazing hill views. If you visit to ella little adam's peak,you want to travel by train journey and end to it ella railway station then you can achive your travel goals in sri lanka. I wouldn't go all the way to Ella just to see this train station.  However, since we were traveling from Kandy to Ella on the train, we had to go to this station.  It is a very small quant little station with some English charm.  You can imagine what this station was like in old colonial times.  Once we got off the train, we only stayed for a few minutes to take a couple pictures. The station platform was fairly crowded once all the passengers got off the train. ... though you can start from there to go to Ella Rock or to the nine arches' bridge.  This is just a station :-) It's a must.  Super cute and picturesque like something out of a children's book.  Beware, double check the dates on your train ticket. The main transport hub in and out of Ella. It’s quaint and they try to keep it well maintained. If getting train tickets, go for third class reserved. It’s more than adequate you have guaranteed seats and great views. Try and book in advance though if you want the 9.24 departure. Turning right along the tracks from Ella station will take you to nine arch bridge. The Kandy train doesn’t cross it- you have to carry on to Badulla if you want to do that. There are toilets here as well. A little bit of England in the style of the railway stationreminicent of the country railway stations in UK. Neatly kept with some developments in progress to deal with the increasing number of tourist. Recieving and handing the Railway tablet is not seen inmany parts of the world and the station master can make a feature out of this. We caught the train from Ella through the tea country.  This is a quaint little railway station with lots of character.  Lots of car parking there too and quite close to the Ella township Although our destination was Ella, our guide advised we stay on the train to its terminus about a half hour beyond Ella, allowing us to go over the famous Nine Arch Bridge on the train and see other spectacular sites as well.  If you have a way to get back to Ella (tuk tuk or whatever) we'd advise traveling at least one stop beyond Ella for the views, then returning. Cute little station amongst the mountains. Looks like in a old British movie. Totally colonial style. The  old Colonial Railway Station has now been undated with more space for travellers to embark and disembark.   Prominent spot in the Ella Town Very pleasant holiday. Such a journey. Amazing views. Food and drinks are possible to buy at the train during many times. Cool cabins. The infamous Sri Lankan train journey. Most people have probably seen the pictures of packed trains with people hanging out of them. If you fear this, don’t. The train you will likely be getting will be full of tourists also and is not overcrowded at all. You will pass the tea plantations, the jungles, the mountains, the local villages, and get to see a large portion of the beauty of Sri Lanka in one trip. For those who like the thrill of adventure, you can sit in the open carriage door and get to feel the wind in your face as you breeze through the countryside. It has a certain romance about it and feels like the stories about train journeys in the early 20th century when exploring was taking off. As you step on/ step off your train, do take a moment to soak in the colonial past left behind by the British. In contrast to other train stations, Ella is well looked after and preserved. Apart from that, remember to hand in your ticket and enjoy Ella.... Unless you're departing - then hope you enjoyed Ella. definitely do not miss this train trip from Kandy to Ella. it 7 hours which definitely worth it. Can not miss it We arrived in Ella by train, and left by train. But we also visited it twice during various treks along the railway line (it's OK, everybody does it, not least, the locals!). The station is beautifully tended, including lovely flower beds. If you're British, and getting on a bit, you will be reminded of a typical BR branch-line station of yesteryear, complete with UK-pattern semaphore signals. So nostalgic! The Ella railway station is well looked after with flowers like many of the Sri Lankan stations. It is quaint and very fitting for the epic train journey from here to Kandy though the tea country. Service at the ticket counter was friendly. Ella is obviously taking care of this railway station. It is nicely made up and makes you feel transported back in time. When you arrive there with a train from Nuwara Eliya say it´s gonna be a little bit busy, but it is still nice to go for a walk there and have a look see. We caught the train from Nuwara Eliya to Ella.  Travelling on the mountain side looking out over tea plantations and stopping for locals to board and alight.  A real unbelievable journey. Well marked, no problem getting assistance! Lacking seating but I think this is standard in Sri Lanka! The station is a quaint old building that was probably built during colonial times. There is only one platform where the trains come and go. Take a look round and you will see old winches and other equipment that have been there for years. The station was lovely and pretty - flowers everywhere, most of the stations are well cared for and have beautiful roses, lillies etc decorating the platform.  The journey from Ella to Kandy was extremely long, 7 hours.  We travelled in second class, which was a mistake, if I went again, I would travel in economy.  The doors were closed and locked in first class and when we I asked if we could have them opened, the guard opened them but asked for a 'gift' - so in other words, the guards were asking for money from first and second class passengers!!!  When you looked out of the window, down the train, you could see that all the doors were open and everyone was sitting with their feet dangling out of the train - free!  As those doors were always unlocked. Later, when I hadn't given him a gift, he locked the door of the train and never returned to reopen it.  Oh well, I had a great 20 minutes whizzing past all the beautiful scenery bare footed!  Throughout the journey, many salespeople boarded the train with welcome food, drink and snacks.  The food was mainly sandwiches, curried eggs and samosas quite nice and kept us going. I would have rated the station itself higher, but I would have rated the journey and the feeling of being taken advantage of, lower. The station is very well maintained winning awards. Lovely gardens around, clean & picturesque ! Station master has been [rightfully] awarded. Stand back when the train arrives from Colombo, The nuber of travellers getting off is huge. But treat yoursel to a trip to Badulla and back, What a fantastic journey We decided to travel against the crowds and go from Ella Station to Nanuoya. We were glad we did as the train was only half full and we were able to get top window seats and for most of the journey a spot in the doorway looking right out over the landscape. Tips: 1. When travelling toward Colombo try get a seat on the right side of the train, much better views than the left side of the train. 2. Forget first class, the windows don’t open and the AC on our trained was poor. 3. If u like the fresh air try get a doorway vantage point ASAP. To avoid losing your spot bring your jumper as the further u go toward Nanuoya the cooler it gets. Staff are very helpful, short walk to the 9 arches bridge, short walk to the start of Ella's peak. Bit of a mad rush when you get off so hold on tight to your loved ones and bags! We arrived here by train after a three hour ride across the heart of the tea country. We would recommend to maybe start here and go in the other direction as ours was so crowded. Ohiya is merely a railway station and a few small shops in the middle of the hill country of Sri Lanka. It's a beautiful place, but please ensure you have booked accommodation and travel arrangements before you arrive there. It is the best place to access Horton Plains National Park if you are travelling by train. We were due to board the train to take us from Ella to Nuwara Eliya and our driver had secured our tickets-but that was just the start of it! The station was packed! And everyone wanted a seat on that train! I shoved my husband forwards and hung on to his coat tails as the train approached. We managed to board but seats had been “reserved” by one Russian lady who seemed to think that water bottles and baseball caps retained seats! There was a bit of a fracas when we removed said objects and informed her that in Yorkshire it’s bums that secure seats-and so we sat down! This is considered to be “one of the scenic railway journeys in the world” and I can well believe it. It’s an absolutely jaw dropping sight with huge sweeping mountains; small, busy villages; stunning areas of protected areas; until you reach the swathes and swathes of tea plantations which totally cover the mountains. An absolute must! Although the Rail Station doesn't have a proper washroom an ATM nearby is helpful.  Have Fun ....... The Olive trees attract numerous migrating birds and plenty of roses are welcoming ..... An additional platform to receive travelers would enhance facilities .... Caught a train from here to Badula town, about 45 mins and a great way to see the countryside, including 9 arches bridge. 20 rupees each way in 3rd class and great fun with the locals coming back in the dark and arriving at Ella in a siding not at a platform as the Blue train was expected and we had to climb down onto the track... so exciting. The other stations along the way are so old fashioned it's like stepping back in time. A small railway station, well maintained.Visited for curiosity. The road leading to the station was very bad, full of mud due to rain. We took the train from Ella to Demodara from this station. It has a real old world charm about it. Place was exceptionally clean and comfortable. Staff were very friendly and helpful,ever willing to help us with information and useful tips! Love this place... Ella station is so pretty and clean.They take pride in their station and it shows with the gardens.Good idea is to buy your rail tickets a day in advance as there are long queues for trains on the day This is a well preserved railway station, worth a visit as it is located in the town of Ella and easy to get to. The train ride to this spot is supposed to be one of the best in the world. This is one of the best railway stations in Sri Lanka. The the surrounding lovely a well maintained flower garden. The station master is well dressed in real English style clothing. Staff is very friendly and helpful This place is a very good example for all the other railway stations. Lovely little place that reminds you of old world. Very English countryside!! One can go there just to see it from outside. Sri Lanka Railways are like a step back in time but in a good way. I loved Ella station but then all the stations on the Ella - Nuwarya Eliya line are like mini postcards, all the station masters dress like admirals and the stations look like the English country railway stations you see in old black and white movies. The trains are slow but hey, we're all here on holiday, so what's the rush? Taking the train from Ella can be long (depending on where you're going) but the station is efficient and clean, and not a bad place to hang out for half an hour (clean bathrooms!!). The station is convenient, and staff is friendly and all speak English. Ella is a famous location in Sri Lanka which is in Uva Province of the country. Accessing by Train is a good mode choice. Nearest tourist attraction locations are Ella Rock, Nine Arch Bridge Demodara, Mini Adam's peak and Ella water fall. These are common tourist attraction areas in Ella. But apart form this Blackpool is nice river runs in that area to visit and have bath. But be careful. little dangerous. The trains stop here.  You also need to go here, more or less, to walk to Ella Rock or the train bridge. Dont miss this if you are in Ella. One of the best scenic rides that nature can offer. The train is very clean and plenty of space. Don't unnecessarily book the first and second class tickets. Its an overkill. Make advance seat reservations in a 3rd class coach. It offers open windows which is a great experience as compared to the closed down windows of the 1st and 2nd class coaches. We caught a train from Ella to Habutale. It was a lovely experience, the views were amazing, the service was great and trains on time. I would recommended for anyone. The signal box we looked at was made in Chippenham, Wiltshire in 1857 ..... and still working, the trains are ""new"" and Chinese but a great thing to do. The stations are a snapshot of colonial times Glad we did it. This is probably one of the best railway stations in Sri Lanka. First of all the surrounding is picturesque. There is a well maintained flowery garden. Cleanliness is very high too. Staff is very friendly and even suggest what to do best , as which train will be ideal or if we are able to have seats etc. This place is a shining example for all the other railway stations. One of the efficent Railway Station in Srilanka.  The maintenance of the place is perfect and mostly the service is outstanding Stayed overnight in Ella before catching the 6.4O train to Nuwellia. We caught the blue train travelling first class.The carriages were comfortable and snacks and drinks were served.On the journey we went through several tunnels and the scenery was beautiful and green. The journey lasted about two hours and we enjoyed every minute enjoying the scenery and calling at several stations on route.It was a welcome change from the heat of the coast.We travelled with Raj of See Lanka travel who wa# an excellent guide pointing out places of interest on route.",4.2,127,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/19/d8/9b/78/this-tour-takes-you-on.jpg?w=700&h=400&s=1,1.0752688172043012,34.40860215053764,5.376344086021505,2.1505376344086025,17.20430107526882,39.784946236559136
Gal Oya National Park,"Gal Oya National Park. Not to be missed. Unique experience A boat safari with guides. Very beautiful! Many elephants and birds. Even monkeys and crocodiles. We stayed until sunset. Which was amazing to see. Amazing boat safari at 6.30am.  Saw elephants,  crocodiles,  snakes and so many beautiful birds.  Don't miss it.  It was raining too much on our first day so the trip was cancelled.   But well worth the wait. I went on a water safari over the Gal Oya Lake Club. These impressions were absolutely worthwhile. It comes as it comes you are lucky that you happen to see animals or not. We happened to watch an elephant for a long time and see a crocodile. Our company took a lot of time. Thank you. It was a special result for me We were looking forward to this tour and it was a nice experience which could have been better if the water level hadn't risen drastically in the last few weeks. It meant the elephants and crocodiles moved away. We saw islands full of birds and the odd Buffalo. The guide also stopped for quick tea and snacks on one of the islands. Recommend doing the tour late afternoon as we were able to capture the amazing sunset. Would recommend but just confirm water levels aren't too high or low so that you get to see wildlife other than birds. It was a super nice experience. So many elephants in the small islands. Lots of birds as well. And few crocodiles. If you are really Lucky could see elephants swimming across to the islands. Have to book a boat at the wildlife department prior to the safari. A great place to spot huge amounts and verity birds but also famous for the swimming elephants. We had an amazing few hours. Galoya is unique.  After reaching the galoya  then take a walk done to see the makarta kata where the river disappears and going round to see how water comes from matrakata is lifetime experience. Then have a bath and enjoy Galoya  lodge repaired lunch is a superb unmatched experience. Very good design of the bungalow, a true feeling of calm and serendipity in the middle of the jungle. This place is not crowded and not well known. Service is high quality. Naturalists ca. Show you around and guide you with interesting information about the birds. Charitha rest Come and enjoy. (boart safari and jeep safari) we take you on this safari fun and safe We were considering taking the boat and jeep safaris.  On our travels we heard bad things about Gal Oya, especially the lake ‘very little water, dead fish and smelly’.  The guest house had quoted LKR 6,000 each for the boat safari, which I think was for the whole boat.  While we were at the guest house the price finally getting down to LRK 8,000 for the whole boat and transport to and from, which as we shared with another couple made it  LKR 2,000 each.  We took the late afternoon trip and overall it was enjoyable.  The water was little low, only a couple of dead fish and no smell.  Crocodiles, lots of birds, elephants albeit a long way away, peaceful and tranquil in the late afternoon.  We also got out of the boat for a walk, to try and get a little closer to the elephants.  So overall this became one of the highlights of our three weeks in Sri Lanka.  It is worth trying the National Park office (latitude 7.21872, longitude 81.542003) to book boat safaris direct, good value if you are a group of four or five.  You can walk from the office to where the boat leaves from – 700m down the road towards the dam, take the path on the right, where the road turns to the left, leading up to the top of the dam and the boats leave from the other side of the dam. There are two safaris at Gal Oya. During the land one we saw elephants from a great distance, jackals, beautiful birds and other animals. The afternoon boat safari took us to an island and hers of elephants were on the opposite bank. Highly recommend these two safaris as you do not chase the animals, you get to observe them in their natural habitat. It was spectacular. With the exception of a few charming fishing boats, we were quite literally the only ones on the dam. Apparently there's only ever two boats on the water. Meaning that it is perfectly tranquil. Although the national park authorities should think about fixing or replacing those boat motors (ours was leaking fuel and even died us halfway through the excursion... not very environmentally friendly!). Still, where do you find this type of pure nature these days? Very very special! lovely peaceful reservoir for boat trip and wildlife viewing.  Local fisherman are allowed despite it being a national park but we enjoyed it.  Limited wildlife (good for water birds, elephants, water buffalo). You can enter to the park using boat through the reservoir. Boats are available near the dam But mid sunny day would be difficult It is a beautiful park, at the beginning it was forest and then a lake. This was a reservoir which is large. Then we drove a short way to the boats which took us around the lake. Beautiful. Gal Oya Lodge arranged our excursions into the park. The lodge has a range of excursions available, including an early morning bird walk, a jeep safari and a boat safari. We did the half day boat safari which is on a nearby huge reservoir. It took about 20 minutes to drive to the reservoir. There is a toilet you can use before you get on the boat. The boat itself is small and without shade, so you need a hat and protection from the sun. There were only the 2 of us with our guide (provided by Gal Oya Lodge) and 2 boat-men on board. During our 2-3 hour trip we only saw one other visiting boat. However we did see lots of wildlife. The place is teeming with birds and we saw crocodiles and elephants, including the fascinating site of an elephant swimming across open water using its trunk as a snorkel. We also did a half day jeep safari. The jungle at Gal Oya is fairly dense and so it is more difficult to spot wildlife compared to other parks. However the guide (again from Gal Oya lodge) educated and informed us about the trees and plants, and we did see a lot of different birds. There is a basic toilet available in the park if you need one. Our trip also included a walk down by the river, with an optional swim. This is a fantastic insight into the truly wild jungle of Sri Lanka - without all the man-made roads that you see in the other parks. However it may not suit you if you are only interested in spotting leopards! Enjoyed an early morning boat safari with the family.  Arranged through our accommodation, left from the dam.  Saw elephants, crocodiles and more.  Only one other boat of visitors. Very nice 2 1/2 hours on the water. Very nice dry zone of forest reserve of the sri lanka for the elephants and lots of more.Very nice time to travel there after rany season... Boat and jeep safari were great It was beautiful on the lake early in the morning. We saw some crocodiles and elephants and a lot of birds. In the afternoon we did a jeep safari. A lot of elephants and the nature is amazing. We are telling everybody to go to Gal Oya because it is quit and beautiful. The first day we went on a jeep safari accompanied with a great park ranger. From the start we were followed by hundreds and hundreds of butterflies. In the park we encountered two groups of elephants and a couple of loners, lots of monkeys, deers, indian rollers, bunch of eagles, herons, storks, parrots, lizards... The second day we went on the boat safari which was really nice in another way. Other than the animals I already mentioned we spotted two crocodiles, bunch of pelicans, cormorans and other birds. This is a really great park which puts all the nature in the spotlight, and not just elephants or leopards. The local jeep safari tickets and the official NP boat safari are much cheaper then the ones Gal Oya Lodge offer. We were here for the second time and had a lovely boat safari in the morning. Saw elephants and lots of birds.This is a very calming and relaxing experience. We went to Gal Oya park for a water safari during our stay at Gal Oya lodge. It is stunning and truly uncommercial. It has a very different feel to the other more commercial parks and definitely worth a visit. We saw elephants, crocs and flapshell turtles. Probably the highlight of our whole trip. What a stunning park, completely off the tourist trail, you literally have the whole place to yourself! Lucky for us we had a picnic on both the early morning boat safari and following day Jeep safari where we got to cool down in the beautiful Makara river. Truly an extraordinarily special place! We had 3 wonderfull hours in the GalOya national park. It is such a wonderfull area and we meet only 1 other Jeep during our 3 hours safari which compared to other parks is quite unique. We saw elephants, djakals, marabou storks, eagles, monkeys etc etc so we saw what we came for.... Did a magical boat safari and were lucky to see so many birds and other animals.The highlight were the giant crocs and the herd of elephants including babies Even we had some trouble to get there (our mistake) this is definitely a must do when you have the chance to do it when you are at Sri Lanka. Really nice nature views of the tank (lake), mountains in the background. Not so much animals although we did see some elephants, crocodiles, pelican, eagles and some monkeys. Expected more wildlife, but the surroundings are beautiful. We went to Yala later for some more wildlife viewing. Very quite clam and relax place.well green.so quite relax.very beautiful environment .you can feel best feeling The whole group went of this boat safari from Gal Oya lodge and what a lovely experience despite the odd very heavy shower.   We had a great time seeing lots of birds and an area with crocodiles which was very exciting.  We also came across one of the local fishermen who showed his catch - quite amazingly large fish.  We also went to the place where the fishermen land their catches and sell to local traders - very interesting.  Our guide bought one which we had for our dinner in the Lodge as a starter - what is better than really fresh fish to eat.   Well worth the trip. We loved our visit to Gal Oya... we didnt see a lot of wildlife but did see lots of birds and thoughly enjoyed our stay at The Gal Oya Lodge. very beautiful place, we stayed at wild life circuit ,located end of the dam, when you go there you can have a boat ride on Sananayake Samudraya, its operated by wild life.It was amazing one. you can see crocodiles , deers, Elephant ,fox, and various kind of Birds during the safari. We went out on a boat safari from Gal Oya Lodge.  What a wonderful morning.  We saw all sorts of birds, in particular White Bellied Sea Eagles.  We also were able to get reasonably close to an elephant in the water which is something I am never going to forget.  Thoroughly enjoyed our visit. We saw many birds, including eagles, and elephants. Breakfast on an island in the middle of the lake. Superb! Piles of birds & elephants, with a few fresh water crocs for good measure. Apart from the outboard very peaceful. The only tourist boats (all3 of them) are government run and are spartan. Take sun block and refreshments. Take a boat safari in this area. It is worth your time and not expensive. You can see elephants bathing. Lots of birds and water buffalo as well. So do not doubt and just do it. Good place for bird watching. This national park situated around the Gal oya reservoir. Belongs to the wild life department Sri Lanka. They have a holiday bungalow which can book online for pretty reasonable cost. And there are two camp sites, Dracula Island and the “makare” both have to be accessed by the boat. Both sites are pretty great. Can make camp there. Wildlife guard will be at you all the time and they are helpful. Have to be aware of the elephants. If you travel there don’t forget to stay the night. We did a jeep safari because we only tried to book the night before and were told a boat safari wasn't possible.  I highly recommend pre booking with your hotel our doing a tour, because we had a some trouble getting our entrance tickets to the park.  In the morning we left, drove past the park entrance to the office which was about 30mins further up the road.  The office was shut because it was still so early, so we spent a long time hanging around trying to get the tickets.  Once in the park, we drove through a forest track for a while, which got boring quite quickly as there was nothing to see in the thick trees.  Once we got out into the open we saw a few animals - deer, iguana, wild boar, jackal, 4 elephants,  toucan, stalk, eagle. Apparently we went at the wrong time to see elephants - if you go at 6pm then about 40 or so elephants all converge at the water hole, however we went at about 9am! Gal oya national park is a nice place for camping which is having a several good camping sites with easy water accessibility. Don't expect to see a huge variety of wild species except deer and elephants. ""මකරේ"" (Makare) is one of the MUST see place in Gal oya. Spent an afternoon on the lake Very relaxing way to see animals Great time with excellent naturists Very special place Gal oya is located in Ampara district. boat safari will be the ideal to witness the animals (elephants, birds, crocodiles etc.....) The park is still very unspoiled, which makes it not easier to spot wildlife. The animals are more shy then f.e. in Yala but also have less tourists. We enjoyed the boat safari the most. So beautiful place, but less facilities. We entered through Nilgala entrance & traveled to Makara area which is Galoya reach the Senanayake reservoir. In that river disappear & flow under the big rocks which amazing. Before Makara area safe to have a bath but careful about slippery rocks in the river. To travel inside the forest, better to use four wheel vehicle and while traveling you may see deers, elephants and various other wild animals. Forest entrance situate around 10km inside from main road. Other option is to reach Makara area through boat. While staying in the area we went into the park both by boat and jeep. The boats are run by the park authority and the outboards tend towards the temperamental. When we went we had to double up in one boat as it was the last one left running and then only just with frequent unscheduled stops and starts. That said, a cruise past the bird colonies and on to the elephant grazing areas is well worth the effort. Back home to the dam with the sunset behind you. We went out by jeep both at dusk and again the following dawn. In the afternoon we saw deer and a mixed herd of elephants along with many species of birds before being rained off. Returning in the morning we saw less wildlife but stopped for breakfast at the river where the stream rushes over and around the massive boulders that give the park its name. Gal Oya is a little visited park with no big hotels and companies offering jeep or boat safaris. As such you can find yourselves as the only people in the park in contrast to the circus that is Yala. Dont expect to see leopards as at Yala or the great herds of elephants as at Kaudulla but you will find a beautiful savannah and a serene lake with masses of water birds and elephants coming down to drink. We enjoyed a picnic breakfast on the shore watching a small herd of 10 elephants grazing nearby. Magical when you are the only people other than the guides! Great place for camping.this camping site is right next to senanayaka samudraya.which is the 2nd biggest lake in Sri Lanka.if you are lucky enough you will be able to see elephants coming to bath in the evening.if you are planning to go for a camping trip in galoya , don't miss the boat safari in senanayaka samudraya. You'll have to pre book the boat safari from the camp office. the park is beautiful but do not go here with the expectation of seeing much or any large game. There are lots of birds but dueto the size of the park and only one road going through and the park having mostly dense forest your odds of seeing large animals is slim, as well as the animals here see very few tourists so they are not acclimated to such We did camping few years ago in Gal Oya National park. That was still the best camping experience in my life. You need to reserve the camping site and boat ride in advance form Department of Wildlife office in Gal oya. You can see lot of elephants and spectacular scenery. There is a reservoir (Inginiyagala reservoir AKA Senanayaka Samudraya) in the middle of the National Park. Gal Oya National Park is most famous for swimming elephants and it is the only national park offering you the precious experience of  Boat Safari in Sri Lanka.. There are two boats (with capacity of 7 and 10 heads) operated by Gal Oya Wild life Department. There are two trips of 2.5 hours long, one at 10 am and another at 3 pm. The boats can be easily reserved by calling Gal Oya - Wild Life Department Office, Inginiyagala. I have reserved a boat on a evening in July 2016. As the boats are operated by Wild Life Department you can see that they are more concerned about Wildlife and always turns off the engines whenever reaching a site to see animals. I was lucky to see Many animals including elephants, deers, Monkeys, Crocodiles countless species of birds and the highlight, one elephant Swimming in between small islands in the Inginiyagala reservoir. Went on the boat safari. It was a good experience. stayed at the bungalow on the dam. need to make the reservation prior as there are only two boats. Go early in the morning at dawn if you want to see the elephants I was there last December. The jeep safari was really short and no animal sightings at all. There are really cool landscapes around the park to see though. As I feel, there are heaps of other national parks in Sri Lanka for wildlife sightings than Galoya National Park. We went on a boat safari as part of our stay at gal Oya lodge. Was great to be out on the boat. We saw many animals such as elephants, crocodiles, Eagles, peacocks, monkeys, many beautiful birds kingfishers, ibis, and loads more. The park is clean and it's not over run with people so you really feel as though you see the animals in there natural habitat. Defiantly worth a visit. Apparently it is possible to see elephants swimming from island to island unfortunately i did not see this but still a magical experience with lots of elephants/ birds and other animals enjoying the shore of Sri lancers biggest lake Largely undeveloped for tourism  .accommodation is unavailable inside in the park. but their is cct bungalow approximately 23km ahead from park office  and their are 4 camp sites. We went at a quiet time and there were no other visitors.  We are keen on birds and did find one patch with quite a variety of small birds but in general there was little to see and not much sign or sound of a lot in this park. Such a beautiful place, no crowds just miles of water and shoreline to explore, abundant wildlife and oodles of elephant s The sunset was an amazing picture.. You can walk around and see lots of birds around the area. But just a good spot to rest and take pictures.. Gal Oya is one of those rare parks that you visit in Sri Lanka that is.... real. As in, you probably won't see hordes of tourists prancing around in Safari Jeeps. The landscape is just gorgeous - the mixture of savannahs and beautiful ebony's are a special combination that truly displays Sri Lanka's biodiversity. Elephants are not used to people in Gal Oya so they are a lot more shy but that makes the experience that much more real. When we went we were driving for about an hour before an elephant, full speed, stormed passed us and retreated to the dense layers of the forest - a delightful change to the elephants in Udawallawe, that are both constrained and far too familiar with people ( :( ). I recommend having a swim in the pool after the waterfall, anywhere else is a bit dangerous as there are crocs! The birds are incredible, we managed to spot the elusive Malabar Trogon & various other beauties. This is a park for someone who wants a real ""in the wild"" experience. If you want to see Leopards and Elephants walk by unexcited by the invasion of people, then you'd probably prefer parks like Yala. Best park in Sri Lanka for seeing REAL wild elephants(be patient though, it takes a bit of adventure)! 10/10 We went on both a boat and jeep safari into this national park with Gal Oya Lodge. their personal naturalist was so accommodating and knowledgeable on all the animals and the jungle. Highly recommended if you want to see a beautiful national park with its towering granite mountains and enormous lake. we saw a few elephants grazing on one of the islands and waited to see if they would swim back to the mainland but sadly they did not obligee... the only thing our gal oya lodge naturalist could not arrange for us. Remote with only one track in and out. So few mammals sightings are not guaranteed: we saw nothing! Go to Yala or Udawalawe. Very small, only one track through it, takes about 15 minutes to drive it, then you turn round and drive back. We saw nothing of the wildlife, and we do understand that they don't come out just because we are there to see them. I am afraid this park did not impress us or other visitors we talked to. About 1/3 off the park is “senanayake samudraya” one of the largest man-made lake in sri lanka , the most interesting scenery  is the elephant s swimming one island to another , this happens during the morning and in the evening , we managed to get  a glimpse of an elephant swimming  in to the island after a swimming from another by island, the boats that they have their does not have any overhead covers/protection so if you are going for a 1-2 hour boat ride ,it’s better to take some kind of and shade or protection before you go , we went up to the point called “makare” where the water initially comes to “sennayake samudryaya” We booked the Wilde life bungalow on the bund of the Senanayake Samudraya.Overlooking a stunning view is this horrid dungeon of a bungalow built to cover any view. More like an alcoholics den with a lingering musty smell. An absolute crime by an Architecht with no imagination. Also this bungalow  serves like a junction  to workers of three departments. There is no privacy. There is drilling going on fe prom morning till evening just outside one of the bedrooms due to a huge electrification project to build a tunnel. Do not book this bungalow. the lake itself is stunning.early morning  as well as evening view is truly magical. the boatman who promised a 6.30 start never turned up. Would have been better to tell that he never turns up till 8am as getting up early & hanging around can be very vexing .Being the rainy season  non punctuality spoilt the whole trip. Boat ride itself has 2 hour 3 hour rides & a full day ride as well as an overnight ride camping In a cave where client has to bring the food.we got this info from the boatman. There is a minimum charge for fiive persons plus taxes. Our intention was to see swimming elephants. There was hardly any info available regarding season if there is any. Boatman claims heavy rain maroons the elephant herds into little islands & they swim back. The tracker at the park claimed that due to drought the elephants finding the lake the only source of water swim to cool themselves. Yet others say the elephants take the route their forefathers took for grazing  be there water or no water. I guess it all depends on luck. We saw plenty of elephants grazing from the boat & lots of eagles diving & catching fish. We also visited the gal oya park from the inginiyagala entrance.  ( there are different entrances ) It was raining & the vehicle we hired Jagath Safaris had the roof leaking getting us all wet. There is not much choice regarding the boats or the vehicles on hire. The boat too is not covered. the road network is not properly planned. Roads do not connect the different entrances length of road coverage on a ""round"" is  very small . Very poorly planned badly managed park.  Very difficult to get much info either from Colombo or at Gal Oya.the natural beauty has not been exploited to its full potential for visitors enjoyment despite the charges. Pity. There seems to be a lot of elephants which can be viewed from the boat as well as from the vehicles.the jungle inside the park it self is very beautiful. The boat trip & the lake stunning.well worth a visit but do expect to get frustrated by the park facilities as well as service.  the natural beauty makes the trip all worth while. I love to go back,and its a nice experience. Do not think or act to disturb the wild life and pls do not carry any plastics with you. leave only your foot steps there and help to protect the cleanliness of that mother nature's worthy gift. We stumbled across this lodge by complete coincidence and wish we had stayed longer. Located in complete isolation in Gal Oya National Park, this luxury lodge exceeded all of our expectations. Wonderful staff and food and incredible accommodation - it's a truly unique experience in any country. Lounge by the pool over a few beers or if you're a bit more adventurous, ask the local guide to escort you to the top of the mountain - about a 2 hour hike up some pretty steep terrane, you won't be disappointed by the amazing view!  The staff couldn't have done more to make our stay perfect - don't miss this place on your visit to Sri Lanka! Its 300 km s from Colombo on Wellawaya - Ampara road from Colombo. This has been estabished  in 1954. This also serves as the main catchment area for the Senanayaka Samudra. It has got a huge forest reserve mainly with medicinal plants , mainly Aralu , Bulu & Nelli. This contains 63,000 Hectares inland cover. You can mainly see Sri lankan Elephant, Deer, Water buffolo, Leopard, Monkey and many other species too. Better to go there either early in the morning or evening. this is a very beautiful place to visit if you are interested in wildlife, especially elephants. unfortunately during my visit the water level of the tank had dropped and the elephants did not swim. but saw a large number of them as well as all the verities of comorants. take boat ride in the early morning or late afternoon. Gal oya National park is located around the Senanake samudraya(Giant tank) which is formed by damming the Galoya at Inginiyagala. Wild life department has organised a boat trip along this giant tank. You can see lots of acqatic birds and heard of elephants. Ideal place for camping. ""The Crossing"" is the sister event of ""The Gathering"" in Minneriya National Park. It signifies the great mammoth elephants swimming from one island to the other in search of food - hence the name ""The Crossing"". There're two boats being operated in the Senanayaka Samudraya which needs to be pre booked. We took a half a day's boat safari and was very lucky to see a couple of elephants ""Crossing"" from one island to the other. It was a once in a lifetime experience where you get to witness swimming elephants, mere several feet away from your boat. But be careful not to get too close or else you might get hit by the elephants trunk. Also this type of nature's phenomenon must be witnessed from a distance since the elephants are very vulnerable in the water while the swim or ""Cross"". Therefore if we get too close to them, the elephants might panic & drown themselves. The best time to witness ""The Crossing"" would be during the months of June, July & August when the water level is down & it's very hard to find water in the nearby forest - Nilgala (which is believed to be the Medicinal Forest of King Budhdhadasa). For Camping lovers this is a perfect place where one can spot a variety of birds or just relax at the campsite enjoying a river bath. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here, it was so relaxing as all one hears is the chirping of birds, and the wide canopy of trees makes it cool to camp under. The river bed is sandy which makes it a pleasure to take a bath. Two hours in a small boat touring the lake (tank ?) were interesting rather than amazing.  Great views close up of various water birds nesting on the rocky islands, and some lovely scenery but not a lot else. Some elephants on the shore were obliging enough to let us get quite close. May be more interesting at other seasons or times of day. Very beautiful place. D.S. Senanayake tank is a Great tank. This park is ideal place for birds watching. We camping one of the Island that tank. I got unforgettable experience that trip. Five in the morning is never an enthusiastic time to get up wherever you are in the world and in Sri Lanka it is still dark. Muddle headed, as I had slept in so many different beds this trip, I could not sort out where I was as the light round the door and the chinks in the window were in strange places but there was no mistaking the urgent bleeping of the alarm. Time to begin the day. No breakfast or even a cup of tea, we scrambled to leave Bibile and were on the road and dodging the jogging platoons of soldiers flanked by white clad PT instructors, armed guards, an ambulance and support trucks by 5.30am. Even at that time it was very hot and I did not envy the soldiers in full combat gear and huge rucksacks with guns slung across their chests. Dawn keen reptiles dotted the road, sleepy dogs who had hogged the central position all night on the hot tarmac and startled birds put up by the sound of our engine, were all a backdrop to our journey to Gal Oya and the Boat Safari. Gal Oya National Park lies in the southeast of Sri Lanka and to the west of Ampara. It was established in 1954 by the Gal Oya Development Board mainly to protect the catchment area of the 'Senanayake Samudra' Reservoir and then handed over to the department of Wildlife Conservation in 1965. It is rich in flora and fauna and about 45% of the park is covered by evergreen forest and a further 33% is taken up by savanna areas. The 25,900 hectare park has about 32 species of mammals including common langur (monkey), endemic toque macaque, leopard, sloth bear, elephant, wild boar, water buffalo and three species of deer. We arrived at the Wild Life Office to pay for our safari by 6.0am to find the place locked up and everyone still asleep so it took a while to get this trip organised but then, armed with a huge piece of paper with many terms and conditions writ small, we motored onto the dam embankment to meet our guides. Dawn had now broken and the light golden and glorious. The men had yet to appear so we chatted with the policeman who we had bought an ice cream the day before in return for the chance to drive across the dam and take photos of the lake. It was a beautiful morning, mellow with golden light, hushed with no wind and mirror perfect. It seemed a shame to disturb the surface with a boat…..  Then guides arrived and while we waited for them to locate the petrol, shove the boat further into the water and check the life jackets we chatted some more to the avuncular officer. Life goes very slowly in this haven of tranquility…. While he stood and basked in the glow of what must be one of the most wondrous places to work in this part of the world, the policeman told us about the elephants we would see, the variety of birds and gave us the back story about the statue behind and above us of a famous previous president of Sri Lanka who coincidentally was the grandfather of a man we were due to meet the following week. Languorous minutes later we clambered aboard and off we went in a surge of foam and waves, to approach the first bird island in a gentle curve which took in the huge expanse of water before us. Approximately 150 of Sri Lanka 's 430 species of birds have been observed seen in this region of many small islands covered with forest and outcrops which are haven to elephants and birds. The ‘Kurulu Dupatha’ or the ’Bird Island ‘ and some of these islands are 'infested' with birds as a great many varieties in their entire splendor swarm these islands. You can step on to this Bird Island and walk through the forest up to the outcrop. From here, you can see many bird’s nests, some with eggs and some even with fledglings who are unable to fly away even when they spot you. Elephants have made these islands their own as they are the best swimmers of all the mammals in the park. As our boat idled quietly towards the shore we hardly dare breathe as we lapped nearer and nearer to a bathing elephant. It lazily splashed water over its shoulder and sighed heavily as it sank into the cool lake, leaving a tide line across its back. Another grazed behind, lumbering ponderously as it flicked grass into a ball and fed in the morning light. Here elephants exists without any intrusions and swim from island to island in search of greener pasture. Whilst not  an ornithologists, I could not help be awed by the displays of abandoned free flying by the hosts of birds as they swooped and wheeled in telepathic unison above us. We breakfasted on cheese crackers, oranges, dry biscuits and sipped what was now hot bottled water on a pristine island in the shade. It might have only been about 10.0am but there it was beating hot. The white rocks reflected heat and the glare made seeing painful without sunglasses but in this spot on the lake, nothing could be more perfect. Conversation, translated both ways by my guide, was about life in the west and contrasts to the east. Misconceptions about the golden life in foreign parts from both our perspectives were corrected and broad daylight camp fire tales were told about our previous travels and adventures in Sri Lanka. The guides lamented the lack of tourists in the area yet appreciated the lack of intrusion - a dilemma many face in these wild parts of Sri Lanka. Once back aboard we struggled with the now intense heat radiating off the water and all went quiet while we motored across the entire width of the lake to creep up on a baby elephant testing its limits on a remote shore. No mother in sight, the baby seemed oblivious to us and played and ambled with joy. On the last lap now, we skirted the final island, awash with birds, splattered with guano, excited screeching and cawing filling the air. We circled quietly, hardly making an noise at all, while we were treated to a close up of these birds in their natural habitat. With a sudden cry, one of the guides stood up in the boat and pointed urgently. A great brown log moved, then shifted so fast it was all over in a few seconds and much before anyone could aim a camera. An crocodile, at least 12 feet long, disappeared into the bushes. We raced off round the island to see if we could find it coming out the other side, but it was too well hidden. So three hours after we set off, subdued and exhilarated with being so close to wild life, we moored at the dam, where another party of Sri Lankans with enough gear for a expedition, were waiting to use the boat so they could go out and camp for a night on one of the islands. But we were sated, filled with the sights and sounds of safari, knowing we had got nearer  to birds and elephants than ever we would by foot or land rover. It was an immense privilege. If you would like to go on this Boat Safari and see Gal Oya, I heartily recommend you contact my guide for the day: sidabode.hibernation@gmail.com",4.4,85,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/04/97/01/56/gal-oya-national-park.jpg?w=700&h=400&s=1,0.0,29.166666666666668,4.166666666666666,1.3888888888888888,40.27777777777778,25.0
Gartmore Falls,"Gartmore Falls. Gartmore Falls is a picturesque waterfall formed by a stream flowing from Maussakelle Reservoir. It cascades down in two main segments, creating a stunning view against the backdrop of lush greenery and misty hills. The falls are part of the Gartmore Estate, a tea plantation area, and are accessible by a short hike through scenic trails. It’s a peaceful and less crowded location, making it ideal for nature lovers and hikers. It was great, we had were able to spend in upper falls, looked incredible view from above , infinity pool can be accessible. Green lush mountains and tea plantation near by. Gartmore Falls, near Adam’s Peak, are among the finest in Sri Lanka.  There are swimming opportunities in the pool at the top of the falls.  The best views of the falls and the reservoir below are from viewpoints in the neighbouring tea estate.  Unfortunately the owners of the tea estate are in the process of erecting a forbidding barbed wire fence to restrict access to this area.  We succeeded in persuading the security staff to allow us to walk to the viewpoints.  But others may not be so lucky. Gartmore Falls, also known as Sri Pada Falls, is a beautiful waterfall located near Maskeliya in the central highlands of Sri Lanka. It is situated within the Gartmore Estate, a tea plantation, and offers stunning views of the surrounding tea fields and the towering Adam's Peak (Sri Pada) in the background. The waterfall is about 25 meters (82 feet) in height and cascades down a rocky slope into a serene pool. It's a less frequently visited destination compared to other popular waterfalls in Sri Lanka, making it an ideal spot for nature lovers and those looking for a peaceful retreat. Visitors often enjoy a short hike through tea plantations to reach the falls, which adds to the charm of the experience. As a tour guide with years of experience leading travelers through Sri Lanka’s diverse landscapes, I can confidently say that Gartmore Falls is one of the country’s most enchanting and often overlooked destinations. Here’s why this hidden gem deserves a spot on your travel itinerary. Gartmore Falls is a tranquil and visually stunning destination that offers a refreshing break from the more frequented tourist spots. Its natural beauty and serene environment make it a must-visit for anyone exploring Sri Lanka’s diverse landscapes. Highly recommended for those looking to connect with nature and experience a slice of Sri Lanka’s untouched beauty. #ExploreSriLanka#ScenicLankaPersonalTourDrivers Very beautiful waterfalls near the Reservoir, best place to swim upper side of the waterfall and scenery walk destination DO NOT MISS THE PLACE",4.7,6,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/d4/63/1f/gartmore-falls-also-known.jpg?w=700&h=400&s=1,0.0,0.0,0.0,16.666666666666664,50.0,33.33333333333333
Girihadu Seya,"Girihadu Seya. This temple very little visited by tourists (we were the only ones) is one of the oldest in Sri Lanka. In the stuppa would rest a Buddha relic: a lock of hair. Believers come to gather there and to access the site you have to climb a certain number of steps. Not easy to access. The place is very interesting and very atypical because you are really with the natives. One of the calm and quiet ancient temples in Sri Lanka, situated in Trincomalee. This temple is considered the first temple ever built in Sri Lanka. Absolutely beautiful and calming place. It is being renovated and that is why you need to give a 500 rupee must donation for 1 person to enter the territory. The are lots of animals peacefully resting around: dogs, monkeys, lizards, insects. You just come to be. The temple itself looks gorgeous and majestic. We have been in the morning, the only visitors and enjoyed the atmosphere very much. Helpful staff at the parking. Worth visiting, but please be respectful and responsible there. This temple is world first buddhist seya wich situated in trincomalee aria. This seya build in 2600 years ago by Thapassu and Balluka. They are businessman at that time. One of the most important buddhist temples in the world. Probably the first sthoopa / daageba (ස්ථූප ) in the world is built here. Located in Trincomalee about 47km away from the city (Nilaveli road) It has a beautiful view from the top (where the sthoopa is located). Main road upto Thiriyaya is carpeted and even from there the road is good ans accessible. A place you should include for the next trip in the eastern Sri Lanka. Oldest Buddhist stupa in Sri Lanka . A very beautiful journey to top of the sacred hill where this age old temple is . A must visit place for all Buddhists . Girihandu Seya is an ancient Buddhist temple located in Thiriyai, around 47km north of Trincomalee. This temple is believed to be the oldest Buddhist temple in the World, said to contain hair relics of Lord Buddha. Commissioned by Thapassu & Bhallika as per the stone inscriptions found on site. It is a beautiful monument in a great location, however people visiting this site has added modern tables, flags & carpets etc which has disrupted it’s originality and the archeological value. IT is about 45 minutes drive from Trincomalee and is probably the oldest stupa / dagoba in the World. It is only a 200 foot climb, the steps are very easy to climb. The place has a sacred feel to it,  the stupa has been undisturbed for thousands of years  unlike in most other places. Famous among locals as the worlds first Stupa which built in the era of buddha by thapasshu n.balhuka traders. Located approx 50km away from trinco town. Seems well above than dhambulla rock cave temple and steps available to climb. Nice sorroundings and stunning views from the rock. ruins of ancient kindgom too can be seen in top of the rock.. The best place that we've been visiting in Sri Lanka! It's just so calm an peaceful. There are not a lot of people there. We only met a couple of monks. We really enjoyed it. It was very humid tough as we were walking upstairs. It is a little bit difficult to find, as you have to drive inland from the main road next to the sea and the sign is not really existent ;) But there was a bus stop. just follow that road and turn right next to the police station. Oh and they charge a little fee.... Wonderful ancient shrine which deemed to be the first Stupa in the world. Located at a higher elevation on a flat province giving a unique view. 40 mins from Trinco and 10 mins to pulmudei. Safe and secured area with lots of nature friendly atmosphere. Early morning or late evening time is recommended. Please donate for the temple as the shrine is highly underprivileged. Built by Thappassu and Balluka merchants. Stunning view from the top of the site. Feel the authorities should give more prominence to this place. Better off visiting this place knowing the background history of this place. The world's first Buddhist Sthoopa believed to be built by Thapassu & Balluka. Girihandu seya is considered as the first Dageba in the world, done by Thapassu Balluka Merchants. This is located in Thiriyaya close to Trincomalee Pulmoddi road. Load Buddha spent 7 weeks ( Sath Sathiya) after his enlightenment ( This is around 528 BC) and End of that period, the 50th day two brother merchants call ""Thapassu Balluka"" offered the first dana ( arms giving). After the Dana, they requested some thing to warship and received ""Kesha Datu""(lock of hair relic) . Those merchants used to travel different parts in the region and came to Sri Lanka also. One day they stayed in this area and kept this relic container on top of a rock and went to the suburb area for the business. On their arrival they found that the container cannot be moved and decided to build a pagoda enshrining the hair relic. Now this is call Girihadu Seya. අප මහා බුදු රජානන් වහන්සේගේ කේෂධාතූන් වහන්සේලා තැන්පත්කොට තපස්සු භල්ලුක වෙළඳ දෙබෑයන් විසින් ගිරිහඬු සෑය ක්‍රි. පූ. 528 දී පමණ මෙම ස්ථානයේදී ඉදිකරවන ලදි. මෙය ලංකාවේ ප්‍රථම දාගැබ වෙයි. ක්‍රි. ව. 67 - 111 කාලයේ රජකම් කළ වසභ මහ රජතුම විසින්  මෙම ප්‍රදේශයේ ""නිතුපත්පාන"" නමින් වැවක් ඉදිකල බව පූජාවලියේ සඳහන් වෙයි. පල්ලව අක්ෂර වලින් සමන්විත අඩි 20 ක් දිග හා අඩි 5ක් පළල ""තිරියාය පර්වත ලිපිය"" ක්‍රි. ව. 733 - 772 අතර රජකම්කළ සිළාමේඝ රජු විසින් කරවන ලද බවත්, එම අක්ෂර වලට අනුව එය ක්‍රි. ව. 8 වන සියවසට අයත් බව පරණවිතාරණ ශූරීන්ගේ මතයයි. ක්‍රි. ව. 1055 - 1110 අතර කාලයේදී මහා විජයභාහු රජතුම විසින් ප්‍රතිසංස්කරණය කළ බව මහාවංශයෙහි සඳහන් වෙයි. This is very first Buddhist temple of the world done by Thapassu Bhalluka merchants. This was built on a top of a mountain in Trincomalee area (around 50km). Few epigraphs are available on the way to the top. More than 1000 steps. Please be kind enough to carry a water bottle and pour it to the Bo tree planted on the top of the mountain. A short distance from Trincomalee the temple and ancient ruins are well worth a visit. The approach roads take on through some beautiful countryside, passing salt beds and lagoons teeming with wildlife - especially birds. We saw some spectacular kingfishers. An ornithologists dream. At the entrance to the site are some small huts where refreshments and fresh fruit can be bought. Even here wild deer and cattle roam quite freely Foreign visitors are expected to make a donation for entry The temple is accessed up a flight of several hundred uneven steps and would not be suitable for anyone with mobility problems From the top of the site it is possible to enjoy panoramic views of the countryside and the ocean to the east Girihadu seya is considered as the first Dageba in Sri Lanka, done by Thapassue Balluka Merchants. This is located in Thiriyaya close to Trincomalee Pulmoddi road. One of the place you should visit in a trip to Trinco. According to legend this is the first stupa build in the world and this Stupa was build by two Indian traders call Tapassu and Bhalluka. It is believed that the Girihadu Seya was built when the Buddha was alive. There is few hundred steps to reach the Stupa and now it almost become to ruin because for last three decades of war face in that aria, But still the view on top is amazing. From Nilavali towards kuchchiweli road, you would find the road to Girihadu seya, world's first dageba and it is believed that the Girihadu Seya was built when Lord Buddha was alive, by the two brother - merchants Thapassu and Balluka. There are around 300 steps to reach the top, but it is a must see if you travel Eastern province. Girihadu seya was built by merchant brothers Thapassu -Bhalluka who offered the first danaya to Lord Buddha back in 528BC. It is said that the hair relic of Lord Buddha is deposited in the Dageba. Located in Thiriyaya 45km on Trincomalee Pulmudai road the location can easily accessed since there are sign boards in all turning points. 2-3 km on to the left after reaching 45 km and another 1.5km on a gravel road you can reach the base of the mountain on top of which the Dageba was built. In order to reach the top one has to climb around 300steps.Shady most of the time there are places to rest on the way.There is an ancient stone bridge and a pond at the base of the mountain. Went to visit this temple on Poya (full moon day). Beautiful and serene atmosphere amongst a welcoming local crowd of worshippers. Beautiful full moon rising over Buddha statues around 6:30pm. Not worth a long trip but if you're in the area it's an off the beaten track attraction well worth a drive. A historical place, Little bit hot in afternoon on top, nice view middle of jungle, drinking water not actually good, nice place in Trincomalee We didn't know it was in our route till we saw the sign said it's just 35km away from Nilaveli! The road to this ancient piece of history still can give an idea, what it might be like to live in a village sooo close to war zone, which had faced its own share of time to time taste of terrorism.. Its very calm and relaxing atmosphere, yet it gives you the feeling of ""something wrong""-- may be due to the lack of livelihood..I can't tell you for sure. Road to Girihadu Seya is damaged badly and signs of elephants can be seen everywhere.. Lots of cows too😜 it takes 300(something) stairs to get to the religious area; so wear your shoes and go! Eventhough the heat and humidity is crazy high, this place is a beauty of nature! They do have few government hostels to stay if you want, but i won't recommend them. This is just maximum 3hrs visit; therefore I don't see a point of staying. Monks and the army people are very friendly--so no need to fear. Directions are clearly given at each turning point, which solves the issue of getting lost 😉 if you want to enjoy this place, then you better stray off a little, rather than just climbing the steps.. If you visit Eastern Province in Sri Lanka (Trincomalee) - make sure you visit this beautiful temple, more than 2000 years old. The road from Trinco is in perfect condition, pitoresque scenary and it's 30-40 min drive. Entry tickets are not expensive and the whole excursion was just perfect. Maje sure you go there in the morning or late afternoon - heat and humidity will make your climb up 150+ stairs rather difficult. Girihandu Seya lies to the North of Trincomalee.  The best way to get to the temple is via Tiriyaya. Took us about an hour to get there from Nilaveli beach. It is a serene and peaceful climb bringing your heart much joy. As you climb be sure to take in the breathtaking views of lush green forests and small bodies of water with lotuses in them. It is untouched in the purest of ways, and as such, gently preserved ruins sit at the top of the hill where one could easily spend hours sitting in reflection. The temple somehow survived Sri Lanka's thirty year civil war but they have very little means. Simple donations of medical supplies, even rice and fruit would be welcome I'm certain. This heritage listed temple is the oldest shrine dedicated to Lord Buddha. Built by the merchant brothers Tapassu and Balluka, It is believed, according to early Buddhist scripture that Tapassu and Balluka met Gotama Buddha seven weeks after his enlightenment, they are said to be the Buddha's first lay disciples. He gave them some of his hair and they had it enshrined at Girihandu, thereby making the temple a sacred place for all. 'Girhandu Seya' which dates back almost 2500 years, is the first ever Buddhist Pagoda built in the country enshrining the relics of Lord Buddha. Even today, the premises and its surroundings emnante a very calm and serene atmosphere which is ideal for meditation. The stupa is built on a small hill which rises a couple of hundred feet from the average ground elevation. Many ancient ruins are scattered around the entrance area including the remains of an ancient stone bridge. There is a large beautiful pond near the  stone stairway where you have to begin the climb to the stupa, filled with water flowers and surrounded by aquatic vegetation and many species of birds. The climb up can be quite tiring. On the way you could see ancient stone inscriptions and also rock caves used by  'Arahath' (enlightened) Buddhist Monks for meditation. Once at the top, the scenary is simply breathtaking! The well preserved ruins of the main stupa along with its surrounding structures invariably brings nostalgia to pilgrims and tourists alike. The fact that the place has a very long history and infact being the very first Buddhist Shrine in Sri Lanka built in an era even prior to the formal introduction of Buddhism to the country by Arhath Mahinda Thero adds a uniqueness and a very nostalgic value to  the place. Devastatingly beautiful landscape panoramas. 'Girihandu' lies to the north of Trincomalee. The early morning journey is half of the joy in getting to 'Girihandu Monastery' and 'Akasa Stupa', also known as the 'Tiriyaya Archeological Zone'. There are some six resident 'Hamuduruvo' (Monks) that live at this remote site. In the Buddhist tradition, the Sangha can only possess what the community provides; and you will see that there is very little (either way) at Girihandu. Please... take a big sack of 'Rice', a big box of 'First Aid' supplies and donation money as 'dana' for the devoted and welcoming keepers, of this inspiring, sacred location. Karmically positive deeds, lead to a greater happiness. The history of the site is fascinating and the 'Akasa Stupa' is a really beautiful ruin. However, remains a very active monastic place of worship and veneration. The hilltop setting provides a stunning outlook in all directions. The stairway climb to the top isn't so arduous. In fact it's a very pretty and idyllic walk. Tiriyaya is a rugged and isolated paradise. It took a couple of hours to arrive by way of three wheeler, hired via the Guest house in Trincomalee. It's a 50km journey (100km in total) from Trincomalee Central Bus station. The journey out; at first light, was transformative. There is quite a bit of information available online regarding the site and its history. If in 'Trinco'... then put it on your list of things to do. An enjoyable 'fringe experience'... literally Takes about 15 minutes climb to get to the top by foot. It's a very serene place with many caves, scriptures, ponds & lakes. The view from the top is great. Excavation is still going on & you are not allowed beyond certain points. If you are interested in Buddhism or history, it's worth a visit. Takes about 45 mins drive from Nilaveli. This believed to be the oldest shrine in Sri Lanka constructed by Tapassu and balluka who were merchants who got the blessings of lord Buddha . This has survived many centuries and in spite of the civil war for last 30 years .This is located approximately 50 km from trinco along trinco pulmudai road . Road is extremely good except for the last 2 km , which is a gravel road but mortorable. A must see if you are interested in Sri Lankan heritage and shrines. The original stupa considered to be the first in Sri Lanka built to house the hair relics of Lord buddha are in ruins but the view from the top is breathtaking particularly at sunset. It is a short climb but the some steps are uneven so you have to be mindful if you are travelling with kids or with elderly. There is a place to buy snacks and drinks at the place where you can park your vehicle. Please be mindful that this is a place of worship and that you would be required to dress appropriately. Considered the first Dageba/ Stupa in Sri Lanka, Girihadu Seya was made by the merchants Thapassue Balluka to enshrine a lock of the Buddha's hair. We drove for about 45min to 1 hour from Trinco to Pulmudai to get here. The area was under LTTLE control for quite a while and new buildings have been demolished by them and monks chased away. The main Dageba remains in ruins. There are about 300 steps to get to the Dageba, and if its not in the scorching heat, would not be unpleasant. The view from the top is great. Arisimale Beach is relatively close by.",4.6,36,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/06/6b/5d/3d/girihadu-seya.jpg?w=700&h=400&s=1,0.0,20.0,10.0,0.0,20.0,50.0
Glenloch Tea Factory,"Glenloch Tea Factory. We dropped into Glenloch for a quick look at tea production and some lunch.  We noticed other visitors receiving guided tours but nobody approached us so we just took a look around ourselves.  It's a bit like stepping back in time for anyone who works in modern manufacturing with a lot of manual labour interspersed with some very old machines. Lunch was quite good although our waiter didn't seem all that interested in serving us.  I recommend the Nasi Goreng. We bought some tea from the extensive range in their tourist shop which is worth a visit as you can smell and/or taste most of the teas available. The driver insisted to bring us here, so we gave this a chance. We tried 3 teas, which I can only describe as ranging from cardboard to floor dust flavour notes. I asked some questions about tea, none of which they were able to answer, for example question ‘what variety of white tea is this?’ Answer ‘white tea’. Thank you. At the end they force you to go the shop and then they get very pushy and annoying. Unsurprisingly one then learns that their workers are very poorly paid which raises all sorts of ethical questions. Absolutely avoid. Interesting visit, we were able to taste different teas. The staff speaks French which made it easier to understand the explanations. The store offers all varieties of teas produced on site. A big drawback for us was that it was the “Full-Moon” holiday and the workers were not in the fields or in the factory.  The tour still showed the tea drying and where the workers would be. We had a tea tasting. Be sure to ask for milk and sugar if you want it, because it is not automatically offered. It is easy to spend lots of money on tea to take home.  Caveat Emptor Its a very informative tour, I have learned new things about Tea. I just a had hard time understanding the accent of the Guide and It will be a bit boring if your really not into the TEA because its a bit lengthy because you will literally go around the whole factory.. But basically the tour was nice, the hostess that guided us and assisted us was very nice. There will also be a free tasting of different teas so that you would have an idea if ever you would purchase some. You can also visit/walk through their plantation and they have very nice view of the mountains. (the whole tour was free of charge) We absolutely loved our experience at Glenloch Tea Estate. The tea tour was truly unforgettable, thanks to our knowledgeable guide who explained every step of tea-making with so much detail and passion. It was fascinating to see the skill, time, and dedication that go into producing each cup of tea. A highlight was dressing up in traditional tea-picking attire and trying to fill a basket ourselves—it was much harder than it looked but so much fun! And the Golden Flush tea we tried? Simply elite. We’re hooked and will only be drinking this from now on! I was able to see and learn about how Tea leaves are picked, sorted, how stems and other waste is removed, and what part of the tea is used in the brew. We were a little time pressed and this suited us down to the ground. It got us into the tea country quickly enough from Kandy (a smidgen over an hour). We got a bit of the view of tea-country, and a fifteen minute tour of a tea factory. I'd like to have spent more time - they could perhaps beef up the tour but it was well worth it. I wish I'd been there when the factory was busier but neither of us regretted this visit. Tea color and taste is very bad after adding a spoonful of Milk. That is why they don't keep even milk powder at the tasting facility. If you are a tea lover then this will be a tour for you! This is a small working tea factory and you see the whole process of how the tea gets from the bush to your cup! We had a lovely guide to show us around. There was a free cup of tea at the end of the tour which we had on a verandah overlooking the beautiful tea plantations. There is also a small shop where you can purchase tea produced at the factory. We had a short, but informative tour which we found extremely interesting. This plantation is set in a stunning setting. We had fun tasting various teas and of course, being British, we bought a good range home for our home and for gifts. Lovely tea I hasten to add. We stopped here on the way to Nuwara. We found the factory tour really interesting and although it was busy our guide really took the time with us. There is a shop where we bought tea but didn't in any way feel obligated like some attractions (this was welcome) keep up the good work. We got a nice tour on the plantage en fabric with friendly staff. Not pushy at all to buy anything. It's worth seeing also with kids. This tea factory hasn't got a lot of publicity but is excellent.  we had our own guide just for the 2 of us - and the tour was fascinating.  Some very old machinery both from Scotland and England and incredibly preserved.  Fascinating tour and then we got to taste tea and pick the tea with the baskets on heads - super tour Most of the bags are either split or they split when stirring in the cup. You end up with a heap of tea leaf bits at the bottom of your cuppa. A complete waste of money and so disappointing after an enjoyable tour. We have visited several tea factories. This one may not have the most informative guided tours but they sell organic tea. I don’t mind paying some Rupees more for superior quality. Always a pleasure to visit a tea factory, and learn their manufacturing process. Make sure you visit when you are around this place. Our driver took us to the Glenloch tea factory on a day trip through Ramboda and into the mountains towards NuwaraEliya. We took a stroll up the hill to see the tea pickers and on the way down two children came to 'chat' to us. Their English was good, but scripted- asking where we were from and welcoming us to Sri Lanka with a handshake. They said they were 12 years old. As we reached halfway back down the hill they started hassling us for money. This was not unexpected, but it saddened me. They should be at school, but obviously rich tourists offer more prospects to them and their family. We didn't give them anything as doing so would only reinforce this practice. Our tour guide was very friendly and answered all of our questions. However, when we reached the 2nd machine where they 'swill' the leaves, one of the workers started to get really angry and was shouting and being pretty abusive to our guide. There is obviously a problem here that they try to cover up, but it was really unpleasant to watch. The tour was quick and the tea at the end seemed good (I tried green and black). There was no pressure for tips or to buy, although I felt obliged to do both. Let's hope the tea lives up to its high price tag once I get it home! Oh and by the way- avoid the toilet unless you are really desperate- awful and door didn't even close! My husband and I were originally going to go to another plantation which we found online but our driver recommend Glenloch Tea factory and we are pleased he did take us here ! We were given a free tour into the factory by a lovely woman who spoke perfect English . She was friendly and knowledgeable about tea . The factory was very interesting as you saw first hand the process of the tea . Very interesting . Afterwards my husband had lunch there with the free tea they served us . Good tea , mediocre lunch but you do not expect great food at a plantation . Good tea ! We bought some tea as. souvenir. We did not need to go see other tea plantations after we had seen this one . Worth a visit if you are in the area ! We liked the tour very much and was interesting to see how tea is being made. At the end you go through a shop. We wanted to buy white tea and we were told that it is not possible to buy it at the supermarket or local shop other than this shop. This was not true. We paid 4 time the cost in the supermarket! We had lunch at its restaurant. The restaurant is under renovation, and so it is very dusty. Food is expensive, cold and not authentic. If possible, I will not recommend anyone to dine there. In contrast, the factory tour is much more pleasant. Our tour guide is really friendly and patiently explained all of our questions. You may request more than one cup of tea if you are preparing to buy some. The factory was built 150 years ago, worth visiting. We were there last December. We stopped over for lunch which was not good at all. We had biryani which was plain yellow rice and a separately fried chicken ... The veg menu was catastrophic as well as it was tasteless. The waiters are very slow but with good intentions. The visit to the tea factory was done in a noisy environment and we could not hear properly the lady who guided us. The tea tasting was the only solace though. We had a brief visit to this tea factory, as our driver/guide took us there on the way from our visit to Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage to our next destination in Colombo. Really pleased we went. Had a full tour of the factory, during which we were told about the types of tea leaf, shown how it's dried and sorted into different grades before being ground down and packed. Followed then by a few cups of different types of tea, including the premium silver tips tea. A worthwhile visit and great insight into tea making. And no charge, other than a discretionary tip for the guide. There was a tea factory tour where the lady took us into the production area and explained to us step by step on how tea is manufactured from tea leaves. She was answering our questions along the way w/o being disinterested. You also get a complimentary cup of tea at the end of the tour and may choose to purchase tea from the cafe itself to bring back home with you. Nice place. will had a a great tour. show and explain everything in detail about Tea making process. from plant to cup of tea. It was really interesting to see the process from beginning to end. Thanks The guide was very friendly and fluent. The location is breathtaking. I would have preferred to walk around the tea plantation for a longer period. Reasonable prices though I expected to find cheaper offers. Definitely worth a visit and really interesting to see the process. We tasted the equivalent to English breakfast. It was nice although our tour guide seemed to be impatient waiting right next to us until we had drank our tea so felt rushed. Didn't buy in the shop as v.expensive but tipped our guide. Don’t waste your time coming here, you’ll leave disappointed.  Our female guide had no interest whatsoever in talking & showing us the factory.  Whole tour took less than 10 minutes. We also made the mistake of eating lunch here.  The five of us all concurred, that it was the worst meal & service in our 8 days in Sri Lanka.  We had the stir fried beef, devilled chicken, biriyani rice, fish & chips (photo below) & spaghetti. We told our driver of our terrible experience & he said “they just get so busy they have to rush”. Well.... that’s not good enough if they want us to spend our hard earned cash with them! Do yourself a favour & avoid this place! In general Sri Lanka has a long way to come in order to reach the level & expertise of service both Thailand & Bali provide to westerners. We were given a quick tour of the factory. It was interesting to find out how tea is processed. We saw all the machines,etc. Tried only 2 different types of tea, they were ok. They have a shop where you're u can purchase tea. It would have been nice to go and see the workers picking the tea in the fields. Visited Glenloch as part of a 1 day organised tour. Tour of Tea factory and the process was very interesting. The tour guide was very friendly and informative and answered any questions. There was a tea tasting session at the end of the tour followed by the opportunity to purchase any of the tasted teas to ""take home"". Very interesting, especially for any tea drinkers out there. Glenloch was magical. We were doing a road trip with tents around Sri Lanka and stumbled across Glenloch whilst trying to find somewhere to pitch out tents as the sun was coming down. The lovely owner let scamp in his garden, whilst we had a private function going on in the guesthouse. Not only that but they provided power, tea, breakfast etc  - they could not have been more hospitable if they tried, and the best thing is that they didn't expect or ask for any money from us. Of course we offered it but they did not seem to expect it. It was the highlight of my trip, the view was stunning, food delicious, and experience unforgettable. Thank you Glenloch! Beautiful nice girl guided us through the whole process of making tea. Very interesting experience to see and smell. Not any easy from the harvest to the final product. And although I am not a particular tea lover I have to say that the taste of the provided sample was simply great and definitely from time to time I have tea instead of coffee. we visited today. I knew that after the tour and explanation they will give tea to drink and then the sales pitch. The green tea to taste was good. I decided to buy their Golden flush which is their own premium brand. I paid 4000 LKR for 50 tea bags. Having read another review that most tea bags had only dust, I tried to try it out in my room as I am staying in Nuwara Eliya today. The tea is not dust but leaves in a pyramid bag (the stronger variety). The tea did taste good with no strong after taste. Good to drink without milk or with just a little bit. I am sure the price will not be this high (£20) if it is not for foreigners. But this is a trend I have seen in this first visit to SL. As with most of these things, our Virgin Holidays tour guide stopped us here, and I'm sure they all get a lovely cut. The tour was interesting enough, though not that informative as the guide's English wasn't amazing. The ""complimentary"" tea was a good redbush. The shop was badly laid out but the pricing was clear and there was no hard sell. The tea was cheaper than it would be in the UK, but again I'm sure it's double what it would cost elsewhere. But at £10 for three boxes it isn't a scam, just a bit of a tourist trap. Although as we were there a bus load of local schoolkids arrived for a tour, so it can't be all that bad. It was a welcome cup of tea and a walk on the long drive from Negombo to Kandy, but not worth going out of your way for. And it's overpriced, but £3.50 in the grand scheme of things isn't worth fretting over Very interesting Tour on the tea factory. Friendly staff and ended the Tour with tea and cake. Best tea ever... A tourist trap.  One is quickly shown around the rather smallish factory.  Complimentary tea and then ushered to a rather pricy factory store.  Where products are sold at double the price.  I will suggest one goes there sees the factory and not buy anything.  Also I think the driver or tour operator gets a cut here.  Also the packaging does not have manufacturing date or product details. Tea has always been a bit mysterious in my part of the world. This tour showed all the stages of production and explained how different teas are handled. There was plenty of time to ramble around the plantation as well. Workers eager to pose to earn extra tips. Interesting that they asked for tips to be put in a box to share among all the workers instead of just to the guides. Seems like a good move. Nice cup of tea at the end and mercifully none of the usual sales pressure. Really enjoyed it. My only regret is that the machinery was so noisy that I missed a lot of the commentary. It's always interesting to see how stuff is made (and not just on Discovery Channel)... They show you the   Very basic and traditional way tea is made!  And then you can try it all... And buy whatever you want.  Best gifts you can take out of Sri Lanka. Did this on our way back from Kandy to Bentota. Not a great tea drinker myself, but my wife wanted to visit a tea plantation. After stopping on the road to see a tea picker picking the shoots, she quickly moved the car to give these to my wife, but in turn expected some Rupees. The tour was quick, reasonably informative, but the guide spoke too fast and was difficult to catch all that she was saying. After the tour we got to sample some tea, and inevitably was led into the shop where my wife purchased, yes, you guessed it, some tea!! Was OK, but could have been a whole lot better. Visited this tea plantation,factory interesting how they produce the tea .Restaurant meal they seemed to be in a hurry asking me before I'd finished if I wanted anything else .Toasted ham & cheese sandwich disappointing. You can check tea plantation, processing at one glance with surrounding awesome natural beauty. verity of teas are available to buy. Our driver made a stop here on the our way up to our hotel. enjoyed good tea. staff were informative. Made some purchases of green and black tea. enjoying it. We enjoyed the tour of the factory and we ate lunch at the onsite restaurant (average and expensive for Sri Lanka). We had a nice lady taking us around but felt the tour was very short, we were then led to a room to sample the tea's on offer (had really bad heartburn after) and were then let into the shop to try and sell us some tea. We didn't buy anything but got some nice photos with the staff. Really interesting tour of the factory to see how Tea is made. Super friendly staff whose English was perfect making it a very engaging tour for us. Great to sample the different teas and purchase some too. Lovely to get the opportunity to pick some tea too Lovely spot, but it might depend which guide you get at this place. Mine was smiley and pleasant but rushed me through the tea factory, hardly explained anything, had no opportunity to pick tea, and was overly eager to ""help"" me purchase tea in the shop. I had to speak quite firmly to her to get her to back off. Also, why doesn't anyone mention the tea pickers themselves? They are the backbone of the industry, as I understand it. Generally low income Tamil women. The guide acted as though they didn't exist and failed to point out the tip box in the factory for the pickers. But she was certainly angling for her own tip. I'd try another place next time. Our driver took us here as an unexpected ""treat"". Very interesting to see what it take to make something that we wll take for granted. The process is very dusty and noisy, but not a sign of masks or ear defenders - a union would have a field day here! Well worth a visit with camera to capture the various stages and look forward to a free cup of tea at the end of the tour. We were taken through the tea making process of making black tea and told about white and green tea. The explanations were quite mechanical rather than related with enthusiasm. We were given English breakfast tea to taste. I would have preferred to walk around the actual tea plantations before getting to the factory. Worth a look if you didn’t see one before. Everyday we consume many cups but never gave a thought of how we manage to get into teabags. Well the wait is over. A brief introduction of how things are managed and kept and packaged are shown and told. Once you know the details, you will learn to enjoy that cup of tea more than ever. The tour educational. Sri Lanka is known for Teas. So find one which you enjoy most :-) I didn't visit this place. A friend did and bought a box of tea for us back home as gift. It had a suspicious smell and tasted awful, sour, kind of reminded me of the smell of peel of lychee. It appeared to us that it wasn't just some cheap tea; instead, something was really wrong with it. One of us started to feel weird in the stomach after drinking it. So you can probably visit this place again, but we don't recommend buying tea from them. On the way nuwara eliya great stop ever for lunch with excellent nasi goren and other set menu , very hard to find descent food in this area And also the free tour of factory is informative and free cup of tea is also gr8 There is a shop and No pressure to buy The Glenloch teafactory gives you a very insight in how tea is processed. You visit all parts of the plant, can touch the tea (interesting from a food safety point of view..) and see how the machines and the workers work. The guide we had hardly was able to explain the process, so it is advisable you have some processing knowledge yourself Very interesting and cognitively ☝🏻 We saw the process of working with tea. We walked near tea plantation , tried different tipes of tea. Very cool 😎 Glenloch tea tree plantation was a lovely and  peaceful. The scenic view was  breathtaking, lush and full of tea plants and other greenery. Having been driven up into the highlands of sri lanka by ranjan we stopped at glenloch .this is where there are more than just black and green tea silver and gold are now added to the list.all are made from the top leaves silver and gold are from the youngest and smallest leaves and along with green are not fermemted Tea came to sri lanka when a scots man borrowed some tea plants from china the rest is history It was super interesting to get an insight into the making of tee! Our guide Ms. Devika was amazing she answered all of our questions and explained everything very well we couldn’t have had a better guide! She also spoke very good English as well as German which was very helpful :) Overall a very nice place to stop for a visits if you’re interested in Tee you can taste different tees as well ! As I have only ever visited one( this) tea factory I really can't say how good it is in comparison to others. What I can say is that we really enjoyed it. Didn't take too long, say the process from start to finish, saw the the classic scene of the tea pickers at work, old but functioning machines drying sorting and rolling the leaves. Very informative guide and a great cuppa to finish it off overlooking the amazing hills. Really recommend this place for a visit Our guide recommended breaking up our journey from Nuwara Eliya to Kandy by stopping at this tea factory (we'd passed many on our way - this was one of the last). We declined to take the tour as we've been fortunate enough to go around a tea factory whilst in the Seychelles and we were were aware that the processing area would be hot! We went into the shop area (which had a good selection of teas) and admired the views from the balcony. We were still offered a free cup of tea, despite not doing the tour. As bird watchers we also noted a few Hill Swallows, a notable species having a very limited distribution in Sri Lanka and south west India. Even though there were tour buses, the two of us got our own private tour.  The girl did a good job explaining things, and was able to answer our questions. It's in a beautiful area, and you can see beautiful views while you sit and enjoy the free cup of tea after the tour. There is a lot of tea to purchase, and your guide will help you but won't be pushy. Myself and 16 travel companions dropped in at this Tea Plantation and Factory on the way from Kandy to Yala. It proved a welcome and informative rest stop. A young woman showed us around the factory floors, providing us with valuable descriptions of the tea manufacturing process from cultivation and picking to how teas are selected and packaged. It was actually quite absorbing. We finally enjoyed cups of Broken Orange Peko Fannings tea, about the best, and made our purchases. The views from the tea house and shop are quite stunning! This was one if those felicitous stops we were glad to have made; I recommend this Tea Factory heartily. I visited Glenloch with my partner during our stay in Sri Lanka. Our guide was kind and showed us the main part of the factory - nothing in depth but good enough. We did taste the different teas they have to offer and they were really tasty. It was good to learn a bit more but nothing was exceptional - at the end of he day the main goal is to sell you overpriced items! Well organized and informative. Our guide was well informed, friendly and helpful. If you're a tea drinker/lover I'd definitely recommend a visit Our driver/guide made sure that we didn't miss to visit this Tea Factory. It was busy with tourists, our guide walked us through the whole process with only some of the machines working in about 20 minutes. This young lady guide was charming but her English accent was very difficult for us to understand. At the end of the factory tour, we were directed to the Gift Shop Area and offered a complimentary cup of tea. Great tea along with a very good selection of teas to buy! The Management would do well to computerize the Billing System and also pay attention to the washrooms which require not only to be upgraded but also better maintained. We really enjoyed our tour of the Glenloch Tea Factory. Our guide was very knowledgable. One tip though - if any of the factory workers offer to pose in a photo they will expect to be paid (we had only just arrived and had no idea what was a reasonable tip amount - the 20 rupees we gave was not well received). I visited Glenloch Tea Factory. It was a good experience to understand how tea is manufactured. Factory Engineer and Supervisor Mrs. Jeevani has demonstrated the complete tea manufacturing process excellently. From welcoming to explaining process and equipments and tea products with sample tastes, it was a wonderful experience. Thank you very much to all the staff!! Second Tea Factory visit and arguably the better one, our guide was superb, very informative, showed us all around and explained very well the different processes. We sampled the different teas in their tea shop and purchased some of the blends to take home. We were also put to work picking tea on their plantation which was an experience - I’m not very good! Our driver took us to this factory. A lot of other buses here. The guide we received was very uninspired and just did the tour as quick as possible. The factory was quite dark and the machines were not running when we were there. We tasted some tea after the tour. Nothing special but we bought some packages of vanilla tea. If your visiting Nuwara Eliya then this place has got to be a place you visit. It gives a great insight into the countries tea industry plus you can taste the tea for yourself. We all enjoyed out stop here they have a good car park and you can see the full tea production process not to mention the spectacular views of the surrounding tea country Called in here for the factory tour and was amazed at how genuinely historically it has been kept. Very noisy so it was difficult to hear what the charming guide was saying but even so very worthwhile. Nice cup of tea at the end and no pressure to buy any products. We stopped in this tea factory where we discovered how the tea is made from the leaf. Good explanations, nice place and good tea. We enjoyed our visit and even if buying tea here is certainly most expensive than in super markets or other places, it is still a pleasure and a good memory. I dear friend visited Sri Lanka and brought back a tin of Glenloch orange pekoe Best brightest flavourI have found in a lifetime of tea sampling The tea factory is like any other you will visit, however, the taste of the their brew was superb. After a round of the factory, they will give you taste of their popular (not their best) brew, which most will abviously like.  I had to ask for tasting their different teas, which my host readily agreed to.  I must confess I am a tea lover and have a weak point for Silver Tips which I found was up to mark and readily purchased two packs - one for myself and one for a friend who too is a tea connoisseur.  Worth a visit I will say. Along the winding drive through the mountains and tea plantations, we stopped at Glenloch Tea Factory. It was really interesting and our guide was knowledgeable and to the point which we liked. After the tour we enjoyed a cup of tea on the balcony and took in the beautiful views before hitting the road again. Being Indian (now living in america) we know the importance of Tea. A cup of tea in the morning gives a kick start to the life. We had detailed view of the Factory and could see how tea is processed from leaf to packed bags. It was interesting and the factory staff was eager to explain whatever we asked for. The restaurant of the Factory was updated with all variety of tea manufactured here. I bought two packs for the house in USA.We visited this factory during our visit to Sri Lanka in Dec.2012.We were on our way to Nuwara Eliya when we took a break here. You do feel a little bit like you are on a conveyer belt here yourself as there are tours starting every few minutes. They only last around 15 minutes and then you are taken to try the tea. The tea sold in the shop is not the cheapest, but then you wouldn't expect it to be. The views from the top of here across the valley are lovely. Interesting quick tour and cup of tea. Looks like nothing has changed in 150 years! I'm not a tea consumer but to me it tasted like everyday supermarket tea.  The was no big pressure to buy.  Left a tip in the box provided. They could have made a nice presentation of sampling but didn't bother.  Lame. We didn't know anything about tea so found this was very informative and fascinating. Felt like our tour girl was in a huge hurry to finish the tour though. Disappointing that the tour was only the factory not the fields too. Haven't tried it yet but bought the strongest tea at 1200 LKR for 400 grams. We had an interest and informative tour of the tea factory followed by a tea tasting and the opportunity to buy some tea from the gift shop. Good activity for all ages. Nice tour conducted by a lady who explained it thoroughly and well on how teas are planted, processed, the various grade and the best way to drink it:).  The tour finished off with sample of teas from the plantations and as usual like many other tourist places, head to the shop - they are reasonably priced and its something that you probably cant get back home!    Nice day out in a nice cool weather.   I really enjoyed it. Look before you eat anything from the restaurant . I found this in my rice on  11 th December 2017 & check your glass before drinking anything . This tour was recomended by our driver but the tour itself was perfunctory, around 10 minutes and they seemed more keen to get us into the shop. The guide herself did not seem overly interested. Nice informative tour from plucking to processing! Tea tasting included! Beautiful tasting room and gift shop! We had a great time at Glenloch. It was very interesting to see how the tea is processed and even better to enjoy a nice cup afterwards. The view is breathtaking and the Tea is excellent. You will find a great cup here. Visit to the Glenloch Tea Factory on the way to Nuwara Eliya was my second visit to a tea factory after the one i visited in Munnar. We were taken around and introduced to the process of tea making starting from plucking to the final product which makes its way to our home. The factory is very neat and it takes about 15 mins to see all the process involved in making some of the finest black tea in the world in terms of its distinct flavor, aroma, and strength. We were treated to a cup of black tea and what stood out was the wonderful aroma. There is a shop from where you can purchase a variety of tea. If you happen to visit Nuwara Eliya, do visit any of the tea factories. It hardly takes a hour and it is not every day you can see your favorite tea processed in front of your eye. I would have given this 4 stars if it wasn't for the relatively hard sell at the end of our tour with tea prices which are ridiculously high.  £4.00 for a small box of loose Earl Grey Tea when it costs less than £1.00 at Cargills is simply too steep. As to the museum, our whole family enjoyed learning about tea and seeing the old British machinery from the 19th century.  It was easy to imagine the workings of the factory and it was an informative trip down memory lane.  I think the factory tour is free but the museum cost £2.50 to get in.  As Tea is part of the Sri Lankan culture now, a visit to some kind of museum should really be on your agenda.  Not sure if this is the best one but it certainly gives you a good insight into the differences of green/black teas and what manufacturing processes are used. We found the Heritage Tea Plantations beautiful as we were driving through the tea country from Kandy to Nuwara Eliya. Our driver stopped at Glenloch Tea Factory to show us how tea is being dried and packed to be ready for a drink. We visited the tea factory late afternoon, so we could not see the whole process. In spite of this, our guide was very nice and he explained everything while he was taking us round. It was so interesting! We got a sample cup of tea to taste their product and then we could buy tea in the shop. We enjoyed our visit here and brought a few boxes of their nice tea home! It is touristy but not a tourist trap. It is well worth a visit - you get a tour of the factory and insight as to how the process is from picking the tea to selling it. And there is a shop where you can buy a variety of Glenloch tea - We bought a lot and have not been dissappointed, the tea is great, nice flavour. We stopped by on the off chance of a tour and were pleased to find that it wasn’t too busy. The tour guide took her time with us, explaining each step of the process in English. Then we had the chance to sample the teas and walk around the shop before going outside to pluck tea ourselves. They also offered our driver a cup while he waited for us. The kids (12 and 9) enjoyed it too! We made a brief stop at the Glenloch Tea Factory as part of our visit to the Nuwara Eliya tea highlands. We had a very informative tour and explanation of the tea production process, and saw some interesting old machinery from the colonial days still in use! The different types and gradings of tea were explained (i now know exactly what is meant by broken orange pekoe) and then we sat down to taste some free samples (NB: cake costs extra). Afterwards, it was on to the gift shop which sold the finished product at reasonable prices. As I had always suspected (and the visit confirmed) the tea we use in the West in our teabags really is called ""dust""!.... On our trip around Sri Lanka we stop among many places here, our guide set us up with a guide a the factory that went trough all the steps of tea making. It was really interesting, and more so if we actually could hear what she said all the time. The noice was a bit to load as the tour was in the actual factory. But maybe she could have spoken up a bit, we had to stay really close and pay attention to hear the main parts at least. After we tasted the different teas and bought quite much to family and friends. Worst experience. Solid marketing but terrible results back home. Red Label is much more better than this Glenloch. One must ask for tasting after adding a bit of milk. Good free tour of working tea factory with original 100 year old + machines. With a nice hot cuppa at the end. Anyone slightly interested in Engineering or manufacturing will enjoy this. I actually enjoyed this more than the temple of the tooth. Nothing to see equipment wise that was actually working other than one large tray of drying tea leaves. Staff were bored and not really interested in anything apart from chatting to each other. Only decent bit was tasting 4 of their teas. Good selection of teas on offer but they were expensive We visited the tea factory at the moment where 2 busses arrived. Our guide was in a hurry because of these busses. We got a lot of information about the proces from leave to tea... with a lot of noise it was dificult to folluw the explanation, such a pitty. We had a tea taste at the end and a big shop where you can buy a lot of different tea . Lovely place that has opened it doors for the public to see how tea leaves are collected and processed. They are generous to share the process and you can taste tea before you decide which you will buy. The lady serving the tea was very friendly and was encouraging me to try the different teas and made the effort to serve me. The tea has a very fresh aroma and refreshing. Tried the white tea for the first time; it gives good complexion, I am told. Would have preferred the commentary from someone who is passionate about the work than someone who just wants to get the job done with. I visited The Glenloch Tea factory with my family. The tour was very interesting and the guide excellent. We bought 8 packs of three kinds of tea to take back to The UK with us…what an idea gift we thought! We also bought some tea for ourselves. However, when we tried to drink the tea after returning home it was unpalatable. The Ginger tea for instance tasted of dish-water, quite disgusting. The friends who we gave the tea as gifts were, without exception, in agreement. I apologised to them. Maybe we bought a bad batch? So I emailed The Glenloch Tea Company and reported what, when and how it tasted. They didn’t answer let alone acknowledge. I checked the email address on their site several times and it was correct. I waited. Two weeks later I wrote again. No response. Two weeks again and I wrote now three weeks on and not even the courtesy of acknowledgement, a reply or even better an apology! I now believe that they must have so many complaints that they just don’t bother to answer. Therefore I would most certainly choose one of the other plantations to visit but if your guide insists that you visit The Glenloch Tea Factory enjoy the tour but be strongly advised NOT to purchase any tea in their shop. We decided to stop at Glenloch for our tea experience rather than the many other processers around Nuwara Eliya as photos of the factory are permitted, as well as due to the fact it was on the way to the town from Kandy. We arrived to be welcomed by a member of staff who would take us around the factory. Tours are free but visitors are invited to give tips at the end which are distrubuted among all staff. We started our tour seeing the picked leaves being sorted. You are then taken through the whole processing process, from drying, through to cutting, to packing. It was a fascinating insight into a product that so many people enjoy. None of it is staged (although there is some now redundant equipment around to help explain how things were done before some parts of the process were mechanised) so you are seeing tea which well end up in your tea back home being processed. At the end of the tour you are invited to try some of the teas and of course purchase some if you wish.  You can also wander around outside and see people picking tea. Definitely worth a stop if you are travelling between Kandy and Nuwara Eliya: its a good way to stretch the legs. Not only are the views breathtakingly beautiful, but the tea served here was delicious! Our guide took us around the factory and allowed us time to peruse before moving on to the next section. Our guide spoke excellent English and answered any questions we had. After the tour, we were served complimentary tea of each variety that the factory sold. My personal favourite being the white silver tip tea. While we were tasting our guide explained the health benefits if each. On site they had a chocoletier stand, and these chocolates were also delicious. Although compared to most places you visit in Sri Lanka, the tea that they sold was more expensive than any where else we had visited. The price is 100% worth it! my partner and I purchased both the golden flush, BOPF, BOP and silver tip tea, and all are fantastic. Tea picking! Once we had finished in the tea factory's resturaunt, we had an opportunity to pick tea from one of the Glenloch tea gardens. All in all a very enjoyable experience and if i were ever in Sri Lanka again I would definitely re-visit. visited as part of a trip to Kandy. Our factory guide was very informative and explained everything clearly. I was delighted to see machinery made in the UK and Ireland 100yrs ago still working. The tasting was also an experience, tasted tea I've never tried before. I've read comments about the tea not tasting the same at home. The main reason for this is the water not the quality of the tea. Personalized Tea Factory Tour was interesting and free.  Tried tea samples and purchased some excellent tea.  Also, had flavored teas.  Our guide stopped here on way to Sigirlya Rock Temple.  Nice to stop and visit by minivan since the other half of our Tea Plantation Tour was taking the Train and our guide picking us up halfway due to time limitations. A quick and free tour it was good to see and learn more about the tea and different types and sizes giving different flavours. Free tea tasting and cup of tea.  The tea shop is how they make their money but it was not madly over priced and did not feel pressured. The views are worth the stop alone. After being to Tea Factories in Sri Lanka in the past, I had told the driver not to bother as my experience is that you gain very little knowledge and are ushered as quick as possible to the shop to try a Luke warm cup of tea and then harassed until you give up and buy a packet of tea. However the guide assured me this one was different and I have to say it was. There was a very friendly guide who showed us around and gave a very informative lecture with props on the process. Afterwards we were offered tea and were in no way harassed to buy tea. Actually the reception in the tea shop was so pleasant I ended up buying tea! Price was very reasonable as well. Certainly worth a visit if you want to visit a tea factory. Rather noticeable were the empty car parks of factories I had visited before! Our Guide arranged a visit to this factory because we wanted to discover the Ceylon tea plantations. Delighted by our visit: nights visited the factory and the processes, tasted the different teas made and even learned how to pick. Very rewarding. Our hostess was charming. We also bought some boxes of good teas as a souvenir ❤️ Glenloch tea factory is smaller than some others, and thus attracts somewhat less tourists. The excursion was quite short, skipping the growing of tea bushes and getting directly to processing tea leafs. The guide was very nice and friendly, and even though she offered not much information herself, she was ready to answer as many additional questions as we asked. After the excursion was a short tasting of tea (good), and a shop with quite a good selection. Upon trying purchased tea at home, I can say I'm not disappointed at all. This was an interesting little tour which shows the process of making tea. We found it quite informational, and you get to sample the tea at end. There's a little restaurant you can eat there with good views. Tour if the tea factory was good and very informative, especially considering I know nothing of the history of tea. I was impressed with what I learned and interested with what they showed me. I had a chance to try several teas afterwards and yes, there was an opportunity to buy, although there was no pressure. This place is worth the visit. Purchased two boxes of tea for 20,000 rupees $20 The lady who provided the tour was very knowledgeable and warm, she had excellent spoken English and the tour was interesting and not too long or short. The shop was quite expensive at the end but made for nice browsing. Great views of the plantation area and a trip worth making if you are in the area Visited this tea plantation on route from Kandy. Our guide was knowledgable and you can walk through the factory and get a good feel of the process. We visited MacWoods after here, and found Glenloch offered us a 'small' plantation feeling, whereas in MacWoods, it was a bit more of a tour round their museum. A short but informative trip round this small tea factory. Some of the machinery processing the tea was very old (not operational when we visited) An opportunity to learn about the variety of teas and how they are produced. A good taster session. We bought a load and I am still enjoying it. Many thanks. We went on 2 tea tours, this one and Pedro - go and do the Pedro tour and refuse the invitation to go here unless you really want to take photos inside (as they're banned on the Pedro tour). Our guide processed us through the tour and told us the rolling machine was a cutter then offered us a cup of tea but seemed agitated when we actually wanted to drink it - she eventually (after about 5 minutes) exclaimed that she was going to leave to take another tour which was a relief but instead remained awkwardly until my wife gave in and we left our tea and went to the shop to buy something and be released from our shadow. As per many of these places, you're pressurised into buying at overinflated prices and if you're on a tour and trusting your guide you often end up falsely believing that the prices are actually normal or that you may not have a better chance to buy tea! The tea prices are determined by where you're from so if you can convince them you live in an ex-pat community in Galle then you may be onto a better deal? I dread to think how much less I could have paid buying premium Ceylon tea in the UK. Pedro was a nicer experience and there was no pressure - actually they didn't even bother to tell us there was a shop where we could buy souvenirs etc. It was 200 rupees for the tour but worth every one of the 100ish pennies that represents. Free to enter, this working tea factory offers you an informative tour during which you can take photos and video and follow up with a free cup of tea.  We bought some tea back to the UK with us and it is delicious! We had a well rehearsed but very interesting explanation of the tea leaf production process, followed by complimentary tea tasting. Photos of the machinery were allowed. Then we were ushered into the shop and closely followed/guided around with some pressure to purchase. However, we both enjoyed the whole experience and felt that we learned something new about tea. We had a very good tour of the factory. Our driver dropped us off at the factory and our guide gave us a detailed description of the process, let us take photographs and he also took some excellent photographs of us. The guide also took us to the edge of the plantation for further photographs, then off to the cafe for a selection of the different complimentary teas. The guide was excellent and looked after us during the time, I think the tip helped, but he was very helpful and we enjoyed the trip. Our driver brought us to this tea factory as I told him I was obsessed with tea. The visit to the tea factory was interesting. The lady walked us through to the entire process and we were lucky enough to see the huge machines in actions. She explained the process briefly and showed us the different types of tea they made. The overall tour took about 10 - 15 minutes. Photography is allowed here, unlike other places which I have read. You can then proceed to the store and purchase some tea - quite reasonable prices (SGD 10 for three large packets). We had lunch here as well. The fried chicken briyani was really good! And view during lunch is amazing as well. Tour and tea tasting are free.  tour is ok but not view of plantation, and not testing except one cup of tea so  tea tasting is a disappointment. If you want to buy tea, this is the place to be ripped off. A total no go.. it's a surprise how they are still on business. If your tour is taking you there, avoid shopping! after visit they send you directly to the shop... there is better place to go. We reached there a bit late, around there closing time. The lady who escorted us gave all the info about the working of the factory. Gave us a few kinds of tea to try. Bought BOPF type and it is absolutely horrible. Total waste of money. I get better tea here in India at a better rate. As with most other tourists, our tour guide recommended this factory because he said most other factories do not have a guide who is there to explain the process.  There was a bit of rain and the factory was about to close (I think it was after closing time). Our guide, Priya / Preeti, was nice enough to stay back and give us a tour of the factory.  Since it was after closing time, the machinery were not operational, but she gave us a full guided tour and was also able to answer most of our queries.  She was a very friendly individual and made sure that she went through the full tour, even for a group of 3 which comprised of 2 adults and 1 child. We were then lead to the tea shop, where we were given a cup of tea to sample.  Then, she showed us to all the various products that they had for sale. They had a decent selection of tea in various shapes and sizes.  The tea is of good quality, having tasted various flavors and selections from what we had bought.  However, for everyday use, the product may be a little too expensive.  As a gift or a novelty item, this would be ideal. Stopped off here on route from Kandy to Nuwara by our driver. Looking forward to it as it is in such a beautiful location. The actual tea factory not the nicest looking place on the outside as it is just a ""corrugated iron"" sheet structure but it is very old. Had a quick tour of the manufacturing process from tea leaf to export sacks. Quite difficult to hear and understand the guide on occasion. Then a nice tasting complimentary tea in their adjoining cafe. and then bought some tea from the gift shop. This was MASSIVELY overpriced and when relatives opened the box on our return to the UK, there were hardly any tea leaves in the pack. Ripped off as usual! We stopped by en route to Nuwara Eliya. Our guide was very informative, showed us the place with a lot of interest and even explained how the different types of teas are categorized,. Since then we've been speaking the language of ""op and bop"". Good experience if you haven't been to a tea factory. The factory is just a conventional one with nothing much different from the others. An interesting tour of the factory to learn about the production of the different types of tea produced there. The entrance is up a fairly steep flight of steps which may challenge some. You are guided round the various stages in production and see the various machines working (little in the way of safety barriers). Because of the machinery the guide is sometimes difficult to hear. At the end you get a cup of tea and exit through the shop (of course). The area where you are served tea has some outside balconies where you can take some panoramic pictures of the tea plantation. This tea factory is located amidst a lush green surrounding, this adds to beauty of the place. The factory itself is nothing special but the staffs were very welcoming, the restaurant had a beautiful view of the tea garden and serve some tasty snacks. You can also take a walk in the tea garden and feel refreshed with all the green surrounding you. If you want to buy some tea , they have a nice little counter for tea where you can buy some nicely packed and reasonable priced tea. It was so useful and a worth visit to the factory...we loved the taste of tea which we preffered...thanks to eveyone who treated us very humbly.. The Glenloch tea farm is a calming and relaxing place to walk in. You get to see many locals plucking tea's. The Factory is small but worth taking the tour of how tea is made, of you haven't visited any other tea factory before. They provide some valuable information about white tea, black tea, green tea etc and is open to questions. The tea being sold is worth buying especially 'silver tips' and 'the golden flush '.  I won't recommend the green tea as it's like any other green tea and neither is the BOP/BOPF too special although they make a big deal out of it. Try the tea before you chose to buy one :) Brought to this tea plantation factory by my tour company, and provided a perfectly spoken English-speaking guide. Interesting information about the tea making process, white tea, black tea and royal flush Ceylon tea levels of tea produce, which we have no idea about when we pick up tea packs in the supermarket. Very informative, complete with tea tasting and an opportunity to buy some as well. Recommended. The tour was short and informative, and the friendly staff promptly provided tea of all sorts for tasting. There are plenty of places to buy your Sri Lankan tea, but when you buy it from here you know it directly benefits the factory workers. We arrived at a quiet time. They provided a personal guide who was extremely friendly (most Sri Lankans are) and very knowledgeable. She explained everything very well, answered questions and let us wander, take photos and look around. We were certainly not rushed. They offered a cup of the locally made tea and a variety of tastings. All were extremely nice and we ended up by some for ourselves and gifts for family and friends. Some of the big name factories can be a little crowded, bug we found this one had a good balance. Not crowded, bug a god crowd in a looking. We had such a lovely tour and learned a lot about the process of tea making. Our guide was super and we were really with how many languages he could give the tour in. You're allowed to take photos and feel/smell the tea leaves at different points in the process. The tour is free and includes and complimentary cup at the end. We got to sit out on the balcony and look out over the scenery. We visited this tea factory in october this year. It is'nt very much. The total tour takes about 10 minutes and for me it was'nt interesting at all. The lady that guided us was not very friendly. We were only with 3 persons and I think she rather had a busload of tourists. In the factory is not very much to see. We stopped for more of a relief stop after visiting the elephant orphanage. The driver said they maintained good toilets, he was not joking. After, we went for a tour of the factory which was excellent. We understood the gradation well. It seems I have been drinking factory floor dust all these years! After the tour and tasting, we were lead to a shop where we stocked up on quite a few ornamental packages to take home to friends. This way the manufacturer gets a fairer share of my spending dollar! Visited here on Jan 22nd,2019. This Ceylon tea factory uses equipment from India & Japan to process tea. You can also climb the tea plantation and photo op with a tea picking basket. An employee explained us the process and lead us through the factory and you can also shop for different flavors of tea in the shop like Orange-grapefruit,black earl grey, cherry & mangoosteen etc. Sample tea drink also served here. Eatery is also attached for pastry/snacks. We had a very interesting and informative tour of this tea factory and we really enjoyed it! I was a little skeptical before we got there, thinking that it might be dull or rigged for tourists but it was great learning about all of the different teas. The tour guide was very knowledgeable and was able to answer all of our questions, and we had the chance to try some of the teas after the tour too. Highly recommended if you're looking to visit a tea factory in Sri Lanka. We were part of a group and had a very interesting visit around the Glenloch estate & factory. Our guide was very knowledgable and gave us an interesting & informative tour of the factory which was very detailed. We visited the plantation where we picked some leaves. A great experience. The tea tasting experience was enjoyable and there was no rush. We visited the boutique which is quite expensive but again, any purchases were our own choice. An experience worth repeating. Visited the tea factory on our way to Nuwara Eliya from Kandy. The driver stopped there to show us the Glenloch tea factory. Were shown the process of tea factory. Then we were offered tea. And of course last we told if we would like to buy some tea. Bought Green tea And BOPF. We paid Srilankan 1000 rupees for 200 grams for both the variety. To our surprise we were not given the purchase bill. On the boxes the price was not mentioned. Even upon insisting also the sales girls refused to give the bill. Later in Colombo saw Brands like Dilsan Tea available for less than half the price. During the tour the guide told us that Dilsan Tea bought tea from Glenloch.  Felt cheated by the Glenloch tea factory. Please do not buy. Even the tea does not take any thing great after paying some crazy prices. No wonder they are not issuing bills as they are cheating tourists. We had a great tour of the tea factory and the guide showed us and told us of each process, a tea picking competition was held after the tour with a box of tea as a prize. we sampled the tea afterwards. well worth the visit enjoyed our time here and there was a well stocked shop to browse and buy tea too. We did not stay at the hotel but did visit the Glenloch Tea Factory en route to Kandy.  The tour was rushed and missed out half the processes.  The sole aim appeared to get us into the showroom and sell us overpriced tea and chocolates.  There must be better tea factories to visit! Visited this factory as part of a tour group and it was very interesting. (Just would have been better if our group of 18 had been split into 2 smaller groups so it was easier to hear). After the tour got the opportunity to test the various teas before looking round the shop. There was a nice handmade chocolate counter - a few free samples might have encouraged people to buy as they looked delicious. Lovely views from the car park Dont go by the crowd here. If the staff feels you are not going to tip them.. they will leave you all by yourself and will not even look at you. They hardly give one type of tea to taste... and in the store, the staff is only looking at western travellers. Instead.. visit smaller tea factories where you will get good personalised treatment which will make you buy some stuff. overall.. a bad experience. We were taken around the factory, and the whole process explained to us. Our guide was knowledgeable and answered our questions, but rather unenthusiastic. He whisked us past the sign which said ""Do not give tips"", and hovered pointedly at the end, as we were trying the different teas. (We resisted). There is a large shop, but as soon as you show any interest the sales lady is unrelenting, so browsing is difficult. An informative visit to a tea factory which explained the production process from picking to the tea cup. Informative but short. You do get a pleasant cup of tea however at the end. We were recommended by our driver ( whose mother is a tea leaf picker)who we have for the week.its a working tea factory,our guide explained the process involved from tree to teacup and we found it fascinating.We both enjoy working factory experiences and the guide was fine.At the end we went into the shop and had some tea buying some rather nice chocolates to have with our teas -I don’t normally drink the stuff! Priya gave us a lovely tour of the tea factory. Finishing off with a tea tasting at the beautiful terrace with a view over the plantations. Thanks a lot. Very informative and interesting tour of a Tea Factory, I will never look at a teabag in the same way. Check out the machinery that is used to process the tea leaves, it is from a bygone age but as the guide said it is still the best way. After the tour of the factory enjoy a cup of tea on the shop/restaurant terrace overlooking the plantation, then browse the shop for tea to take home. Very informative and interesting short tour of the production plant, surprising to see how simple the process is. Finishing with a lovely cup of their tea (of course) and surprisingly for Sri Lanka, free! Was amazing to see bus loads of Chinese tourists packing huge boxes of tea to take home! A cup of tea will never be the same, now that I have understood and seen the complex process involved! The factory is the same as others, but the tea lobby is very nice. Good to look and have a tea. I thing, their tea was the most expensive of all, where I been, but try the lobby, the shopping is not the must. Very informative visit ladies who show you around are lovely.. free tea tasting.. free entry.. tea shop is lovely. & a go at tea picking with the tea ladies Our driver took us there for lunch with us having no idea that we will get to visit a tea factory as well. A good surprise. In short food was good. We were served with complimentary cups of tea as well which tasted really refreshing. Tour of tea factory was not too long but the guide gave good insights on how different kind of teas are prepared. Well recommended. Enjoyed seeing and hearing how the tea manufacturing worked, all explained by a lovely young lady. Saw the different types of tea, then into the cafe for a cuppa. Not very nice tea at all which was a shame as we would have purchased for gifts etc. I feel they need to put more thought into this aspect of the tour if they wish visitors to purchase tea. Quite slap dash at the end, perhaps if they introduced a tea tasting experience, similar to a winery it may be more enjoyable. Since we arrived all employees were very nice and polite. The rooms were very big and bed very comfortable, also with a nice view on tea hills. In the morning after breakfast we visited the tea factory and tea plantation. Ms. Shiva guided us trough it with a perfect and detailed explanation and after she showed us how to take and select the right leaves in order to have the perfect tea. After a tea tasting we could buy some of their delicious teas. Thank you very much for this experience! A special thanks to Ms. Shiva and all the hotel employees. Interesting free tour of an old tea factory with some of the original equipment still there, all the workers were toiling at their various jobs from sorting, sifting, drying the tea to packaging it for auction.  Our guide was a bit perfunctory and difficult to understand but most of the processes were obvious.  One thing to note, all the workers were barefoot. At the end of the tour you are offered a cup of tea, either black, green or white (white is the most flavoursome) and then can purchase from a variety of boxed tea, a bit overpriced as most tourist items are in Sri Lanka. When we were there there were several coaches and people in the cafeteria, so be aware it is a real tourist stop, but interesting if you want to learn how tea is processed. Interesting old style tea processing factory and equipment.  Some old equipment is preserved for historical interest.  Our free tour guide was mechanical and perfunctory but as there were only two of us, I think she was keen to get to the next (hopefully larger) group of tourists.  Free cup of tea in the tea shop was OK but limited choice to select from.  The limited selection of tea packs on sale were ridiculously priced. If you want to buy tea in Sri Lanka I recommend you visit the markets where the locals buy.  We got some lovely silver tip tea in a small spice shop in Galle at very reasonable price. On our trip towards Nuwara Eliya we stopped off for a visit at the Glenloch Tea Factory. The Guide shows you upstairs in the tea sorting room and explains the process involved in tea production. The machinery is very old but obviously still does the job. Workers seemed used to having tourists watch them work. You can take photos. Even thou there is a clear sign not to tip the Guide you are put in a position to discreetly pass him something. I did not see the Tip Box. After the tour a very nice hot cuppa is provided. No idea what type we were given as we were left in peace to enjoy it. No pressure made to purchase any tea as the shop was busy with a bus of tourists. We did not have the opportunity to walk amongst the tea bushes but our driver very kindly offered a stop further down the road. Stoped there on our way to Nuwara Eliya. Visit was rushed. The lady dropped us for a Tamil group which had just arrived half way through. Tea tasting was weak tea which didn’t make us want to buy much... The tour conducted here was very comprehensive and was absolutely free. The guides answer questions clearly and there is even an opportunity to taste the tea for free! Tea sold here is decently priced. Tour and tea tasting are free. However, the tea tasting is a disappointment. If you want to buy tea, this is the place to be ripped off. A total no go.. it's a surprise how they are still on business. If your tour is taking you there, avoid shopping! We were on the road from Kandy to Nuwara Eliya and took an hour to stop at the Glenloch Tea Factory. We were invited to pick tea leaves in the fields and so began our first lessons in the art of tea making. So many things to learn but our guide Ganga, made our tour really enjoyable. We then entered the main processing part of the tour, learning how the tea leaves are dried, ground, filtered and crushed before being roasted. The kids and adults had a great experience, finished off by tea tasting. The atmosphere was relaxed and there was no pressure to purchase along the way...however by the time we had finished everyone wanted to buy some tea. Thanks again to Ganga for making the tour so much fun. Very interesting... A lot of work goes into producing that perfect ""cup"" of tea! They have a well stocked shop where various blends of loose tea can be purchased! This holiday was our first visit to Sri Lanka and we really wanted to do a tea factory/tea picking visit. This one was recommended and organised by the local travel agent (ground agent for Kuoni). I imagine this is not dissimilar to other tea factory offerings and as far as I was concerned ticked all the relevant boxes. What surprised me most was that we were touring  a working, commercial operation and allowed to get up close and handle the (largely ancient) equipment and the tea in its different process stages. I was expecting something slightly more sanitised behind Perspex screens with UK-style endless warnings about health and safety etc but blessedly there was none of that. Our friendly guide gave us a brisk tour of the different stages but never hurried us when we wanted to look closer, take photos and generally dilly-dally taking the place in. Information she gave was hugely informative and I learnt a lot about the process. After the machinery we had a tea tasting of 4 of the teas (slightly disappointingly we were just left alone to sample while our guide disappeared - some tasting pointers or things to look out for would have added to the experience) then guided through the retail operation to part with money. We didn't mind and there is no obligation to buy anything and the prices were probably not unreasonable. Finally we had a brief tea-picking experience. Basket-strung-from-the-head photo opportunity rather than a picking experience but was good to do if only to appreciate how hard the real tea pickers work for their low wages. Doing this, my wife managed to pick up a leech too which wasn't part of the formal picking experience but served to again emphasise just one of the hazards of the job for real! (Could have been worse - could have been a venomous snake bite!). A must do if you love tea and this was a good tour in a real working factory with an enthusiastic guide. Stopped here and had a tour of the factory. Quite interesting particularily some of the victorian machinery still being used but the tour is brief. Then it is into the cafe and shop where you can try a varirty of teas and purchase different teas and souvenirs. Typical tourist type place. The Tea factory is located in a natural scenic backdrop.A cup of hot and tasty Ceylon tea is served to us.I had a factory tour.Very good explanation about the production of tea was given by one the Glenloch staff. Excellent place to tour. We visited as part of a Tour group en route from Kandy to the Hill Country. We did the Factory tour with full process explanations from an English speaking employee. Then a tasting experience and on to the shop, with innumerable tea offerings. Good stop off. Fairly attractive premises externally and a nice balcony area to sit and sample the various teas produced on the estate while listening to a commentary on their origins and production. Then it as off to the factory where the guide took us through the various stages from picking, drying, fermenting, etc. Interesting talk but difficult to hear with the noise of the machinery. No noise reduction earmuffs being worn or evident anywhere. From there we progressed to the shop where the finished product in all it's varieties awaited us in assorted packets, containers, tins, presentation boxes, etc. I enjoyed the tastings when we arrived but considered the priced product way higher than I expected and did not make a purchase despite the best endeavors and entreaties of the fashionable sales ladies.  Interesting visit and we left with a greater appreciation of the conditions that are experienced by the workforce before our favourite brands reach the shelves. I really enjoyed the visit to this tea factory. It was really interesting to see the process from beginning to end. This is still a thriving and active tea factory. Very informative and great to see the various stages of production. Enjoyed the smells too. Good tasting experience at the end and of course, we bought some! We visited while on a bike tour. They factory has a nice balcony where you can sample tea (we had four kinds: English Breakfast, Green, White, and Special). They were all quite good, and were a healthy sample size. The balcony overlooked a valley, and was quite a pleasant view. However, there is some major construction happening right below the balcony which was a bit noisy, but hopefully it will be terminated soon. The tour guides wanted to know if we wanted to eat, but all they had was mostly things we don't eat (breads, pasta, cake and cookies, etc), and it was on the pricey side, so we declined. However, the other guests seemed to like their food, so it might be a good place to eat. We were then taken on a factory and plantation tour, both which were very interesting since to that point I really didn't know how tea was made, and the difference between black, green, white, and a new tea that I had never heard of 'silver tip'. Apparently it is mainly about the different age of the leafs, and then their is very little difference aside from the fact that black tea is fermented and then dried, whereas the others are steamed. We then bought some tea in the gift shop, which was very reasonably priced, and then I went to have one more delicious green tea before we started to ride again. To my great surprise, they gave me the extra tea again for free since I had bought some tea in the gift shop. The gift shop had all sorts of teas, in all types of formats. They had all the teas mentioned in the samples above, and they had mixes with herbal ingredients. They also had most in loose and bad format. Lastly, they had packages in different sizes and containers. I wanted pure green tea, and I was offered a 200 gram loose tea in a simple box for 1100 rupees, or 100 gram in a display tin for 1000 rupees. Our tour guide was very nice, and was informed. Overall, if you like tea, or are just looking for a nice view, consider stopping here, or at one of the many tea plantations along the way. Tea plants thrive in a specific combination of ideal climate, diverse geography, rich soil, and consistent rainfall. Sri Lanka’s central highlands offer these perfect conditions: high altitudes provide cool temperatures, high humidity, and plentiful, well-distributed rain to hydrate the vegetation. It is this ""Goldilocks zone"" that allows the slow growth necessary for complex flavors to develop in high-quality tea leaves. A visit to the Glenloch Tea estate immerses you in this environment, featuring a tour of the lush tea fields, the intricate leaf processing factory, and a tasting session. Afterward, guests can explore a well-stocked, if relatively expensive, gift shop to purchase their favorite blends. When you do the must-visit tea factory tour I guess it depends a lot on the guide. Our guide was pleasant and knowledgeable and answered our questions competently and politely.This factory has some quite old machinery which is fascinating in its own right.You can also visit the plantation itself but we seemed to be left alone to do that if we wished. You are given five varieties of tea to taste, which was served with a smile and was nicely hot. Then of course the shop - and what seemed expensive packets of tea. But we did follow the notice saying no tips - which is probably the only one you will see in Sri Lanka! We had earlier on visited a tea museum in a former tea factory so it was very interesting to visit an active tea factory to see the different processes and all the different kinds of tea made from the same plant. We had a free cup of tea and also had the chance to taste and compare green tea, white tea and brown tea. (We can recommend the brownie cake in the cafe, it didn’t look as fancy as the other cakes in the display but it had a good taste) Having spent 4 days in the beautiful Ella and Nuwara Eliya areas we were disappointed by this factory tour. Short and non motivational followed by pressure to buy what we discovered  later was “expensive” tea. Got an informative tour of the factory and the teas they produce by a friendly young woman, saw some of the tea-picking action, and were served 3 types of teas to try. The tea shop seemed a little expensive but was worth it considering the effort they put into the tour. We found the tour of the very interesting and the experience  of picking the tea. I would agree with other travellers that it seemed very rushed to the point of just getting you in and out. We were offered a visit to the shop after having cups of the different types of tea,this we declined as I suspected it would be over priced I am sure that there are better ones in the area. So if you have a choice try somewhere else that might take more time with you We had a fabulous tour at this working tea factory. Our guide was extremely knowledgeable and it was fascinating to see how tea is processed and hear how the process has evolved over time. The tea tasting at the end of the tour was a nice way to end, and they allowed us to try the more expensive teas at no cost. We also ate lunch here which was tasty and well priced. We didn't feel any pressure to purchase in the shop, although we did, however they listened to what we wanted and our budget and showed us only that. Highly recommend a visit. Glenloch is 2 or 3 hours drive from Kandy but it is well worth the journey if, like me, you have never seen a tea plantation before.  En route you pass through interesting countryside including tea growing areas as you get closer, and there are great views as you get higher.  The factory tour and the tasting are really interesting and I am very glad I went.  One point: tea pickers are very poor indeed so they are very persistent if given a chance to beg: you should take quite a few small banknotes with which to thank them if you photograph them. Visit on recommendation of my guide. Tour of the factory, well explained, nothing in a hurry, though I went solo. Bought some Gold Tea, White Tea, Golden Pekoe and Silver Tips after the tasting. Decent lunch with stunning views over the mountain and the lake. Maybe there are better tea factories, but I was quite happy to have visited Glenloch. Beautiful tea factory and friendly guides that walk you through tea making process. Complimentary cup of tea. Can go and walk up in tea fields if desire. The tour was interesting in what it was, though we had a very disinterested, dry tour guide not only that a couple of cheeky factory workers tricked us into paying for a photo of the station they where working in (we hadn't seen the no tipping factory workers sign at that stage). Visit is worth the stop in house guide has her talk down to a tea gift shop is well stocked.Take time to walk the tea garden the views around are amazing Stopped here on the way to Nuwara Eliya - in the middle of fantastic countryside - and was a fascinating insight into how tea is made. Something we take for granted. The factory and machinery is quite old and it felt like a real working place which we were fortunate enough to see - the whole process was very well explained too. The tour was free and the guide was very nice and informative and there was none of the 'hard sell' that you get at some of these places. Complimentary tea at the end and some nice tea products in the shop. We really enjoyed our visit and it was one of the highlights of our holiday. We spent a pleasant hour here having the factory tour & then a cup of tea & fish croquettes in the cafe. I wouldn't go out of my way to visit this place, but it was free (apart from the croquet & tips) & did break up a long & winding trip from Kandy to Ella A tea factory and visitor centre situated in a stunning location with panoramic views of the surrounding areas and tea plantations An ideal stop off point for a snack or meal Glen Loch has a great restaurant with an outside terrace to view the scenery. It does host coach parties so can be very busy if several arrive at the same time It is possible to have a free tea tasting. Samples of the various teas (Gold, Silver, Green and Breakfast) are served in china cups. Although I am not a tea drinker I enjoyed the experience very much Of course there is a shop where you can buy the tea and many other gifts Complete waste of time to visit this place. They provide a guided tour with a very very disinterested guide and then plonk some cups of teas in front after the “tour” (which in itself is a non-event) is out of the day. There is the ubiquitous shop which sells teas at a price far higher than what we usually pay in supermarkets in our home country. It’s free but that does not mean you waste precious time here. In a nutshell it’s a favorite of tour guides and drivers which is usually a good sign of a “tourist trap” or place to avoid. The tour of the tea factory was very interesting with incredible smells. Refreshingly, we weren’t pestered or rushed into the shop at the end as one usually is at the end of such tours. Even so, the shop was very busy as the prices are good and the quality of the tea is high. They also offer free tastings of the different teas they make. The second of the 2 tea factory tours we went on. The other was at Pedro, and we feel this is the better one. A comparison of the 2 below Glenloch : It operates for most of the day, and we got full access to the factory floor. And as close as we would like to the machinery. In total the tour was 45 mins around the factory, and we could take as many photos as we wanted. Has a nice shop area at the end, where you can purchase, and also sample for free, their offerings Pedro : stops working at 10am, as they told us they do most processing at night. We came just after that, and it was being washed down. No point coming on a factory tour if it's not working. Also they really didn't want you taking photos, and asked you to put the camera away. Got just 1 sample of tea  and it is their budget offering. Winner : by far it is Glenloch A must go place!  We were greeted with traditional Namesty, and lots of smiling faces. A lady named Kamaleshawari took us around and guided us thru the factory. It is quite a neat place. They also have a very nice tea lounge and shopping places. The tea made there is not of very high quality maybe. The blend wasn't of our liking! We stayed in a place just above the factory. The Glenloch villa, very nice place! I am really thankful to the tea factory Incharge for making it possible for my package to reach Colombo airport before we left Srilanka. Really nice people!! On the way to Nuwareliya from Kandy, this factory is located near pussawella. Nice place situated amidst the tea estates. Lot of tamil women working in this tea factory. A person named mrs.sasikala explained us about various types of tea and tea leaves processing. They also offered us a cup of aromatic sri lankan tea free of cost. It tastes excellent. Nice place to relax and sip a good tea. As tea lovers we were looking forward to a few hours at Glenloch and we weren’t disappointed. Our guide was very knowledgable and explained the whole process of the tea manufacturing from start to finish. We were given a tour throughput the factory, took photo’s and asked questions. It was fascinating to see and so incredible what goes into it all. We got a chance to puck some tea leaves which was great fun! Afterwards we got to try some of the different varieties and purchase some from their well stocked shop. Brilliant tour and highly recommend. We went when they were about to shut, but even then they took us around and explained to us in detail, what is the process of tea making.Very knowledgeable got to taste the various teas. overall very interesting. Our family were on a tour and we stopped off here. It was extremely fascinating and the kids enjoyed it thoroughly. Even the kids tried the tea. (Only one enjoyed!!!). We had cake with our tea and even that was cheap! I highly recommend this location! We must have had a bad tour guide, because everyone else seems to have had a good experience here. Our tour guide spent less than 10 minutes with us. She rushed us through the processing rooms, didn't speak loud enough to hear her over the machinery and only seemed interested in getting us into the gift shop -- and it wasn't even a busy day! This would have been an ideal location for a full tour. We would have loved to walk through the fields to see the workers picking the tea, and to take the time to understand how the tea is processed. But we learned very little with our whirlwind tour. It was nice to have a complimentary cup of tea at the end of the tour, however. We had such wonderful experiences all over Sri Lanka. The locals could not be more accommodating and friendly. This was the only sour note in our entire visit to this lovely, welcoming country. Perhaps the tour guide was just having a bad day... As a chauffeur guide it is us who recommend the guest/ tourist about a hotel or restuarant for lunch. Yesterday I had to take my guests to Glenloch for lunch and i am seriously disappointed the way they treated us. Is it fair to charge for guides meal as we take the guest for the restuarant ? The staff is so rude saying that the guest had only one portion meal therefore i had to pay for guide meal. This will be the first and last time we will take a guest for your restuarant. Hereafter will not recommend glenloch for anyone. For your kind information this message will be forwarded to all tourist guide groups and relavant tourism companies as well. Glen lodge do not forget that you gain your business mostly through our (guides)  recommendations. An attractive young woman took us and an Italian couple round the factory. She had clearly repeated the same information many times over and seemed somewhat stopped in her tracks when we showed interest and asked questions. She appeared eager to get us through to the end and give us a cup of tea, before escorting us through to the shop, where we were clearly expected to buy some tea. In our opinion the prices were extortionate and we left without purchasing. The young lady appeared very disappointed. Not clear if she has to rely on the sales that are made. Our driver who chose to take us here rather than a factory that I asked to go to, was also very clearly upset that we didn't buy and tried (in vain) to persuade us to go back in and buy some! Subhashini, Explained very well stage by stage which was exemplary.  We recommend this place honestly. Thanks, Vettri This tea factory makes a great pit-stop when travelling between Kandy and Ella. We arrived just as a coach tour was leaving and although crowded we had an English speaking guide to ourselves. The tour took us through the full sequence of preparing tea and we learnt about the difference between the varieties ( Strong, Pekoe, Green  etc.)  The restrooms were clean. the tour ended with a tasting of several varieties of teas, after which we bought some for ourselves and as gifts for friends. The only downside was that  Livingston Harvest Green Tea with Raspberry and Strawberry we brought home  expecting a tasty fruit tea turned out to be a coarse green tea with no additives that is undrinkable. It tasted and looked like a cabbage leaf tea...not at all what is to be expected of any sri lankan tea. This is a typical stop arrange by the taxi drivers and tour operators to put tourist in commercially tourist shops. They sell it as a ""tea factory tour"" but is basically a show around the factory to end in the factory souvenir shop to be force either to tip the tour guide or to buy a very expensive selection of tea's. This is very common in this part of the world. You would see this kind of stops in Thailand, Indonesia and even in India. The Spice Garden is something very similar and its around the corner. You might buy something that you like but at a very expensive price (for Sri Lanka). But don't allow to be push around with this methodology. If you don't wanna stop or buy, nobody can force you. Glenloch seemed smaller than other tea factories we had seen around, but we really enjoyed it. We had a tour with another couple (who were French - our guide lady said 'I will explain slowly because they are French' lol!) to see how the tea was produced. The machines were fascinating and the whole area smelt so fragrant. After the short tour, you are given a cup of tea which was really nice (and I don't like tea... yeah, I said it!) apart from the massive spider I could be hanging from the rafters. Husband bought a couple of boxes of tea. All in all a nice little stop! it's smaller than Mackwood Factory but still nice place to visit. the tour was nice and guide is a nice guy after that we have been given some cups of tea and it was awesome so I went to the store and bought some packs and that's really recommended. things I didn't like are the tea lounge were you get your complementary tea was awful and need to get finished and have a nice interior and the exterior .. same goes to the store . still they have the best tea ever (royal tea). We stopped here on our travels,  we were met by a friendly lady who showed us around explaining all the processes in tea making. We even had a go at picking the tea leaves with traditional baskets. Great experience well worth a visit. This is the first tea factory o e gets to see while heading to Nuwara Eliya. The factory has guides to take you on an informative walk around the tea factory. It is pretty informative for children as well as adults. Finally one gets to enjoy tea tasting and you can also buy the tea from there. It makes a good gift for people back home. Lovely tour guide Gung and smashing teas to taste afterwards. And a very beautiful setting. Definitely worth stopping by. Lovely Tea Factory.  It was great to see the original 150 year old factory, with all the original machinery.  Everyone was really nice and we had a tea tasting at the end.  Huge shop with lots of Tea's to take home. Quite informative tour, demonstrating how tea is produced.  It was quite short and curt and lacked real detail.  The opportunity to try tea picking was good.  Tasting was just of one brew - which was disappointing.  The shop had a decent range of products available Short visit, quick tour from informative guide, interesting. Quick tasting and visit to the shop. Toilets clean. Enough said. We arrived at Glenloch around 8.15 am, hungry and tired after almost 2 hrs ride from Kandy - so we wanted some breakfast, and some tea. Since the service started only at 8.30 am, the staff asked us to order our food and take a look at the accompanying shop. We ended up buying all kinds of tea brands from them. :) Breakfast was very heavy. We had ordered club sandwich, cheese and tomato sandwich, cheese and tomato omelette, milk tea and green tea. Green tea was on the house. And the milk tea was out of this world - so much so that we had to ask the brand, and each one of us bought at least one packet on Glenloch BOPF. You must try (and buy) this. The sandwich was too much for us, so we doggy-bagged them. But it was tasty. The service staff were very cordial. The place itself is lovely, a bit up the hill, with a sit-out that overlooks the hill. There was enough place to seat at least around 150 people at one time. After breakfast, we went for a visit inside the tea factory, and the young lady guided us and gave a brief history of tea making in a sing song voice. That itself is an unique experience. This is a short tour, and you must take it to understand the different nuances of tea production. Worth the time spent. My husband and I visited the tea factory as part of a 4 day tour we had booked through Hayes and Jarvis called ""Cultural Kandy and Tea."" The tour of the factory was detailed and the guide was very informative. He told us to pose near the tea for photos etc and took some photos for us. We viewed the whole tea making process, which was fascinating. However, at the end of the tour we were taken up to a terrace and provided with a cup of tea (which tasted fantastic by the way) and the guide stood over us, clearly waiting for a tip. My husband explained to him that our other guide (who was driving us around for the whole trip) had not yet taken us to a cash machine and so we had no money to give for a tip. We apologised profusely, however the man just stayed there stood over us, which made us feel very uncomfortable. After a while he gave up, a lady came over and took our cups away quite rudely. I was feeling quite mortified by this time and thought I would at least buy something from the gift shop with my bank card so that we would at least spend some money there. Again, the staff in the shop were abrupt, the lady who served me practically threw my bank card at me. We couldn't leave there quickly enough. I think it should be made much more clear that tips are expected here; we always tip generously, however I think sometimes it helps to remember that we had already paid several thousands of pounds for our holiday, which included the tour. It also wasn't our fault that our driver hadn't taken us to an ATM machine! (I had actually tried to take money out at the airport but he advised against it). I would recommend the trip, however please be advised that you will not be treated very nicely if you don't tip the guide. the people get paid £4 a day to pick the tea and they still smile and want you to smile back ! you a free cup of tea that is produced where you have just seen we brought some home and its amazing ! better than your tesco,asda sainsbury's Most tea factories have become just for tourists and are there for show, however Glenloch was different. This factory was a lot less busy, so the guide we had didn’t need to rush us through. We was able to see all the staff at work and also were able to take pictures (most of the factories don’t allow this.) It was fascinating to see the process of tea making! At the end we was able to taste 5 different types of tea with gorgeous views of the tea fields. What’s best is all of this is free! There’s a huge selection of teas to buy afterwards, some that come in beautiful wodden boxes, which make great gifts! Would recommend this trip to any tea lover! What a amazing place.  We just drink tea and say what a taste.  But there are lots and lots of affords behind it.  Very nice process , high quality tea packed in front of you.  Make sure that you bye one.  And you can enjoy the hills of tea plantation. It's very cold. Please take warm clothes.  You can bye organic vegetables too. Best place to hear about the tea manufacture . The staff is so nice and you feel that they do their job with a big pleasure Recommend this experience, Your guide takes you through the factory, explains the process. You have a tasting, and then venture into the plantation, where you can try your hand at plucking ! Not at all crowded, a great experience. Our driver recommended the place. We first had a short tour around the factory then we went to the plantation, where we tried to pick the tea leaves on our own. Afterwards we had a brief tea tasting and then we could shop in the local store. We liked the tea with guava and sour sop, so the store has prepared for us a few extra cans. Interesting and informative stop on any trip between Kandy and Nuwara Eliya. A guide takes you round the factory explaining the process and the function of each of the machines (absolutely necessary - there's a withering area, a rolling process, Fermentation/Oxidisation process, drying machine, grading room, etc.) and you end up in a tea-tasting cafè, on a balcony which gives you a panoramic view of the Mataweli River valley. Finally, there's a shop. This a nice relaxing tour around the tea factory. It's interesting to see how it gets made, it's a laborious task and the machines are still quite rudimentary. Enjoy some tea and cake in the restaurant afterwards, there are nice views. The tour is free with a tip box system in use at the end of the tour The visit is very informative, despite the coldness of our hostess A visit to the store is essential, but there, the staff is really anti-commercial. You are there to buy and not to ask questions!! The saleswoman gives us a dented box and never wanted to change it, claiming that there were no more Nice walk on the tea blending process and visit to the tea factory. Its an educational tour but they expect you to buy tea at the end which is quite expensive. Some teas were really good. Nice visit at Glenloch tea factory. We had a english speaking guide who showed us the tea factory. She told us all about the process. We could ask questions and she gave us good answers. Afterwards we got to taste black, white, green tea. Nice store where you could buy tea. Good experience! Visiting a tea factory is a must when visiting SriLanka.   The amazing fresh tea smell permeates the air, and the landscape of Nuwara Eliya is beautiful.   Glenloch is no exception. Our guide to the tea factory spouted many dodgy facts about tea.  For example, she seemed to think black tea was high in vitamin C and had more vitamin C than green tea.   She did not know what fermentation or oxidation were.  When I asked questions to clarify her knowledge, she hit back by asking my travel partner whether I could understand English. Ouch!  She then treated me like a retard who couldn't understand what she was saying, which was totally fine with me, because I knew she didn't know even the basics of the tea making process.   I have attached a picture of the dodgy guide.   Surely it takes only 10minutes of reading Wikipedia to pass some basic facts on and she couldn't even do that. I've attached a pic of the guide. We didn't get a tour of the plantation outside.  We were told we could wander down the path/road to take a better look outside.  We weren't allowed to walk on the plantation slopes as a safety precaution. Once inside, we tasted just one type of tea. It was OK.   The shop was a bit overpriced.  I bought BOP tea in the cheapest packaging, it was 1000rupees. No discounts, no haggling.   Our driver was pretty happy because he got some free tea from the ladies there once we had made our purchases.  I think drivers who bring visitors to Glenloch obviously get perks which depend on how much their visitors spend -  that's enough incentive for them to choose this tea factory over others.  The tea itself tastes great.   Heaps better than the Dilmah you get in Australia. In this factory, the same tea gets packaged as different brands.  The price point is just determined by how fancy the brand is, which is mainly comes down to how beautiful the packaging is.   So you might as well buy the no frills packaging. We visited this factory as it was selected by our driver/guide. Mondays a bad, as no tea picking takes places on Sunday, so half of the tour was looking at machines, standing still, as no activity took place. The guide was friendly and knowledgeable, and the free tea tasting was very nice. there are nice views from the tea house. This plantation and factory is worth visiting. It is not overly commercial and still has much of the original machinery.  As an avid tea drinker I learnt a lot, especially about tea dust. The ladies who looked after us were warm, friendly and a little wicked, in a nice way. A tip: there is no picking on Sunday thus the machinery does not operate on Monday. That is when the factory is cleaned. I had no idea how the different kinds of tea were processed before my visit here; and it was very interesting to see a real factory at work close up with an informative guide. Free cups of the finished product were available to taste and although it was, as usual, exit via the gift shop, it was nice that no-one put any pressure on us to buy anything Not being a tea drinker I honestly didn't think that I would get anything from the tour experience at the tea factory but was i so wrong I had a great time learning about different teas and how the leaves are picked by hand and dried and then ground the lady that showed us around was awesome ( sorry I forgot your name but see pictures) . I didn't like the tea tasting but in all honesty I drink coffee as my preference however others in my party love it. What a fantastic place this is.  So full of history and demonstration of the hard working people who patiently pick the tea leaves that we all enjoy around the world.  We did a short tour that is free but there is a box to place tips for the staff.  They share these which is a good and fair system.  Then you are able to do tea tasting and select tea for purchase. I got carried away shopping again but it is so fresh how can you revisit. I would buy more of the exotic white and silver tea next time. Glenloch Tea was established 150 years ago and that in its self is quite remarkable to still be processing tea for export around the world. The tour was interesting to watch the process from start to finish and enjoy several tasting cups of tea at the end. The staff were friendly and we felt no pressure to make a purchase....but we did however and my family now wish me to track down were I can purchase it in Australia! It is very quite place where you can get information about tea fabrication and its history. Also you can have a lucnh or dinner in the reataurant. Prices is not high and quality of foods is very good. I you are not the maniac of tea don't buy tea in this place. Because it is expencive, but not the best. Just enjoy history, nature and meal :) Unplanned visit. we were short on time for going towards nuwara eliya from kandy. I dont drink tea in fact never tasted. Our driver recommended so decided to take a small stop. Interesting and informative tour and follow up with a free cup of tea (if you like to). We ended up buying lot of tea for family and friends :) You get to see the journey of the famed Ceylon tea from the field to your cup. The guide shows you all the processes involved and also the various types of tea that is made. At the end of the tour you get to taste each variety of tea before making a purchase( optional) This is such a beautiful tea plantation. We were guided round the factory and explained the process by Divya. Divya then took us to taste the tea and pick tea in the plantations ourselves. Excellent service, brilliant experience and delicious tea. Of all the tea estates to visit do not choose this one. Our driver insisted we come here because it is one of the estates that is 100% Sri Lankan owned. Whilst I wanted to support local business the way we were treated here was disappointing. The lady provided a very rushed tour, she had no expression on her face and often yawned. When we asked any questions she was reluctant to answer. Of course at the end she wanted her tip and when we were browsing the shop she suddenly became interested in helping us (perhaps she gets a commission). We were so excited to visit this beautiful part of Sri Lanka but being treated like we were just $$ took the pleasure out of our experience. I have heard other estates provide more customer service training to their staff and might be better to visit. I hope the owners of the Glenloch estate read this and review their service levels. The tour takes <15 mins where they will explain about the process of making the tea. Afterwhich, they will let you sample some tea. There's a shop onsite. Its up to individuals whether they wish to buy. We really enjoyed our tour of this tea factory and learning how tea is made. We had no idea it is such a long process. You are given some tea to sample in the cafe at the end and then inevitably we bought a fair amount to bring home. The only irritant was the lady in the shop who followed us round as we were browsing the teas almost hassling us to buy! Each group gets it's own free guide, however due to the large number of visitors, they rush the tour so that they can move onto the next group. Although the factory tour was a mere 5 minutes, it was quite interesting to see the tea making process (4 teas from a single plant). Thereafter they let you taste a cup of tea (no milk). But at this point, the guide disappears, so it's best to ask questions before they go. Then, the salesmen take over and try to sell you the overpriced tea. In conclusion, we drove up from Kandy to visit the tea plantations, and had we known it would have just been a 5 minute experience, we wouldn't have wasted a night at Nuwara Eliya. Our driver took us here on the way to the Heritance Tea Factory hotel.  It was a really interesting visit.  We never realised just how many processes went into making tea.  We really do take it for granted with our tea bags back home!!!  A gentleman took us round who was the amanger, showing us the full process, we could take pictures and the staff were smiling whilst working away non stop.  After the factory tour he took us to see the tea plantation next to the factory so we could see and touch the tea bushes.  Once the tour was finished, he took us to the shop where we had a complimentary cup of tea which was delicious.  My husband gave him what we thought was a reasonable tip, considering there is a tip box in the shop, we shouldn't be expected to give twice.  He was the manager, was certainly on a better wage than the tea factory workers.  He mumbled something under his breath about the tip not being big enough.  We just politely smiled and walked away!!! We bought a box of various fruit teas for us to enjoy at home.  Worth a visit but make sure you don't have the greedy manager show you round!!!! This is a chance to see how the tea as picked starts the process into your cup. The actual tea factory looks like every other one in the area, apparently using a design perfected in the 19th century, with machinery invariably from the UK.  It is however interesting to see the process in action, starting with a sort of fermentation where a lot of the water content is removed naturally, through a grinding into small segments and then a final drying.  The there's a lot more to it, particularly the blending, testing, tasting and packaging, but those are the initial steps. All the time specialised machinery is doing the real work. After an informative tour showing the process you are invited to a tasting session where you can try and distinguish between the various products.  Finally, there is the opportunity to buy some genuine Ceylon tea.  I have to say that I did not find the selling to be very pushy. For a visit of just over an hour I found this to be very interesting. Interesting tour on the tea making process in an old factory. Enjoyed the tea tasting after the tour and bought tea to take home from the shop. I didn't know this place. The driver took me there and I've loved the place. The explanation  is very clear and illuminance. Leads you step by step into the creation of tea; white,green,black,strong and delicate. At the end they serve you a taste of all the  qualities and of course the tour ends in their shop where you can buy every kind of tea. After that it is mendetory to step into the tea plants to take some picture with their basket on the shoulders. We stopped here to visit the tea factory and the plantation. The tea pickers demonstrated their skills and the factory workers the process of producing tea. This was followed by a tea tasting session of various strengths and types before visiting the onsite shop. This tea factory/plantation was fantastic. I have attached a picture of our guide. Believed to be in her late 20's, she was very sweet, professional and knowledgable! Seeing the whole process of how tea is made was really interesting and I was surprised to learn that all different types of tea come from the same plant just a different leaf! I always assumed it was a different tea plant all together. We got to taste the tea afterwards and after tasting how fresh and how creamy the taste was, of course we had to buy some! I will be absolutely gutted when I run out of the tea! It tastes amazing. Our tea back home is nothing in comparison to here. I definitely believe this is the place to visit if you want to see a tea plantation/factory. I was told by my driver that this is the only tea factory still owned by Sri Lanka. This was sad to learn. Please visit this place rather than the places owned by large corporations! You'll never taste tea better than you do here. Also, if the owner of this factory is reading this review, the lady I have uploaded a photo of deserves a promotion, she was superb. We had visited similar places in India and China but still enjoyed our tour of Glenloch.  We had a lovely guide who explained the whole process and at the end enjoyed a tasting of a couple of the teas. Finally, we were allowed to do a bit of tea picking, touristy yes but still good fun. A must stop on the way to Ella. The tour is completely free, with samples of tea at the end. We had the amazing Divya give us the tour. Her English was impeccable and she was so knowledgeable, having worked there for 10 years! Their tea is so delicious, we couldn't resist buying some in the lovely shop at the end. The old English sorting machines are still doing their job. The team also added a new machine, which can be seen. The tea tastes wonderful. My husband and I were enroute from Kandy to Nanuoya to catch the midday train to Ella. Our driver recommended we leave very early so we could stop in Nuwara Eliya to visit Glenloch as it is Sri Lankas tea capital apparently. Tour was just the two of us and the lady spoke excellent English and zipped us around the factory in about 10-15min which was fine for us and free (just tip as you please). Tried a couple of teas and bought some as well (no pressure to buy which was nice). We called in to this tea factory and were treated to a tour of the factory which was very informative Following the tour we had a free cup of tea which unlike se of the bought ones in the supermarket has no chemicals and is so nice u don't need milk or sugar Entrance is free also Never buy anything from the tea factory they will cheat you. We purchased worth Rs. 13000/- (Sri Lankan) tea from outlet of factory all most all the containers are having tea dust... As a tea lever I enjoyed my one on my one tour here. The tour started with a visit inside the factory. From here we went outside into the tea plantation where I had a small look into the life of a picker. My last stop was a visit to the cafe where I was treated to a tasting of 4 different teas. Make sure you treat your self to a cholesterol or other treat too! I finished my tour off with a visit to the shop to purchase some tea to take home with me to Australia. The tour itself was free, I just tipped my lovely guide! Tour delivered in a speedy and robotic fashion - was difficult to understand and then man marked in the shop and felt pressured to purchase something, weren’t able to browse at own pace. Tea tasting was good though. Recommended by our driver and listed in our copy of Lonely Planet, we had a very good brief stop here. Lunch was simple but very tasty, the tour was short but very interesting. In fact, they were bagging up tea during the tour which meant we got to see the factory working. Afterwards we had a complimentary cup of tea - which was lovely. Shop is not over-priced for being direct from the source. A worthwhile tea factory tour. Like many others we stopped at Glenloch on our way from Kandy to Nuwara Eliya.   Because of the number of visitors we weren't able to find a guide who had been recommended.  And so the young woman who was available began to explain the tea making process.  Within moments it became clear that she would rather be elsewhere.  We began to feel that we were imposing as she recited her memorized script.  She  seemed  to discourage questions.   The explanation that she provide was adequate albeit quite basic.  After our brief tour we were ushered into the tasting room where we were offered a cup of tea.  She stood over us (more like hovered)as we sipped our tea and then followed us into the shop never more than a few steps behind.  It felt quite uncomfortable.....to the point where we simply wanted to leave even though we were planning on buying some tea.   Sorry Glenloch...we had hoped for a better experience. I love tea, so I was always going to visit A tea factory.  I understand they're all pretty much of a muchness, all similarly styled from the colonial days of past.  The walk around with an attractive and good English speaking female talked us through the tea making process from the leaf picking to the sorting, drying, crushing, dividing, bagging of the leaves. All looks archaic but it seems to do the trick and they produce and export an enormous quantity per day, so very impressive.  You then get a taste of 3 teas, black, green & white - all good then you can buy loose or bags.  I must say we did buy some green tea and now home can taste the difference to what I've bought in supermarkets.  What they don't show you are the fields and pickers, but you do have the benefit of seeing these lush fields on steep hills on the route into the plantations.  Looks like incredibly hard work but the Sri Lankan people are generous with their smiles so go ahead and visit if you have time. Factory guide girls are really friendly you can find a guide who can speak your language. They explain it very well. And also tea here is upto the standard. You can taste different types of tea free of charge. I take my clients to this place as the first stop on the way to Nuwara eliya from Kandy. It's a must to visit a tea factory during travelling through Sri Lanka. We had a short guided tour in the factory which was interesting. Good for buying some gifts for people at home,",3.8,400,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/c6/35/0f/glenloch-tea-factory.jpg?w=700&h=400&s=1,0.0,44.1025641025641,4.358974358974359,0.5128205128205128,17.94871794871795,33.07692307692307
Hadapanagala Lake,Hadapanagala Lake. The water supplies to many farmers to grow many things to the Sri Lankans. Electric fence gives protection to the villagers from elephants. Very well maintained by the government. if you go in the evening you will see the elephant one side of lake.you can talk with fisher man and can arrange nice boat tour in the lake,4.3,3,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/17/e5/a5/ab/hadapanagala-lake.jpg?w=700&h=400&s=1,0.0,50.0,0.0,0.0,50.0,0.0
Horton Plains Kalupahana Trail,"Horton Plains Kalupahana Trail. Wonderful Amazon tour from Horton plains very good guide Ranjan and went to the best forest in Sri Lanka today thank you very much Ranjan he is wonderful guide and make good tour we enjoy a lot,+94718824646 naturally and bird watching guide. Very nice location, peaceful hike around beautiful nature with nice views on top of the mountain, totally recommend it! It's a amazing path way for the trails of the hill side in the beautiful nature friendly ceylon tea plantations. Be good to the nature will give the return like this to see and admire very nice location and happy to be here in a happy way Your path via udaweriya,you can got a nice views on your way for momorable forever.always you can feel heaven is there Hortan plains is one of the most visited place of mine. There is few different roads we can go there. Many select Ohiya and few select via Kalupahana. After you enter Hortain plains there is more than mini worlds end and worlds end to see. There is few beautiful streems and Bakers fall. Me and wife visit Horton Plains on the way from Kandy to Hikkaduva  Very good natur park.   But lots of walking. Some say you have to get up at 5am to do this walk.  The sensible logic is that it gets hot during the day and the damp air rising up at the lookout points condenses in to cloud by late morning and kills the view which you are there for, plus rain can come in the afternoons.  We have teenage children, so 5am was never going to happen.  We started walking at 10am.  The day was part sunny and with a slight breeze and we made it to Little Worlds End with a great view.  The Worlds End view, was cloudy when we got there, but within seconds had entirely cleared for pictures, and then gone again within another minute.  Lots of wildlife along the way, Monkeys hooting and displaying in the trees, coloured lizards / chameleons all over the place, lots of pretty birds and flowers.  Best to go clockwise so you reach the lookout places as early as you can, ref the cloud issue, and then take a leisurely walk down and around the valley and the stream, meanders and waterfalls along the way.  Worth a quick look at the basic museum near the ticket office, to understand the context of how the place has changed over the centuries, deforestation, elephant killing, the impact of invasive species (who would have through Trout could be a pest?), and even potato farming as recently as the 60s, before it was made in to a reserve.  Not cheap to enter the park, but worth it to keep and preserve the area. See this place. It has a huge area of beauti. Feel the environment by walking there. It is cool place even in the day time. This is on a grass high land with some up and down, but overall it is easy hike. Very fresh air on highland and some good photo spot. a beautiful place where i could take my time looking at the scenery, a lovely waterfall with a cozy viewing deck This trail connects the major views in Horton Plains National park and is a moderate walk of 9 km taking about 2h20 to 3hours to complete. This is meant to be generating water almost every season of the country, you reach this attraction during your Horton plains hike If you like nature, and you have a few hrs to spare, then this walk is certainly a must. Expect it to take aprox 3hrs, as there's quite a lot to see and video(mobile). The walk is about 6miles long so  don't walk alone and make sure you have some form of sustenance.(food/liquid).......Enjoy.!!! This is the trail that almost everybody does once they go to Horton Plains National Park. There are many highlights in the Trail. 1. Mini World's end. 2. Great World's end 3. Baker's falls 4. Chimini Pool 5. Endless beautiful landscapes :-) The Chimney Pool is situated between Baker's Fall and the brick sign post at Y junction which had been mentioned earlier. This man made bund using granite has created a water mass in an elevation above the pool below and flows into the pool as a kind of a waterfall. The pool is in abundance with Kekatiya plants ( Aponogeton jacobsenii) which also can be seen in the stream running along side of the trail at some places. While this seems to be what travelers visit, it should not be taken lightly.  What is involved, is a 14 km walk, mostly through rough trails on rocks, mud, and river beds.  I can't imagine what it would be like if the conditions were rainy or any more wet/ slippery!  I would not recommend it for young families or anyone that does not have appropriate footwear.  I did like some of the sites but spent most of the time watching my footing.  We were disappointed not to see any fauna, beyond the deer at the entrance. This is a wonderful trail , you get to see very light green plants , blue mountains . Feels like you are passing through a piece of heaven. This plain is a wonderful sight to walk and you tent to enjoy the beauty of mother nature. simply picture perfect! take time to dip you feet and feel the cold nature water. so refreshing On A 4 route at 160 km from Colombo you get Kalupahana Junction.  From there you can take a cool walk to Horton Plains through Bambarakanda falls and bakers falls. Just remember to take enough water and food , other wise there is no place to buy them until you reach pattipola",4.5,29,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0d/f8/f5/90/photo2jpg.jpg?w=700&h=400&s=1,0.0,10.0,5.0,5.0,30.0,50.0
Hunnasgiriya Water Fall,"Hunnasgiriya Water Fall. This quite a famous waterfall mostly owing to the fact that there is a hotel built right at the top of the waterfall which was considered THE Honeymoon Hotel among Sri Lankans in the late 1900s..The hotel is still there and freshly renovated (according to what we heard). Google directions are accurate.... Wattegama - Elkaduwa road is slightly bumpy and narrow. There is a turnofff from this main road and you have travel about 1.5 kms to reach the waterfall. The access road was freshly carpeted at the time of our visit. The road is wide enough to park vehicles. There is a entranceway from where you have to buy a ticket (LKR 150 per local) and climb down a few steps leading to a pathway upto the waterfall. There is also a railing (not the safest though) which you can use to cross the waterfall in the middle. There was a summer hut, washrooms and a place to change clothes. It also seemed as if they have built a place to bathe as well. (Not so sure about this). The waterfall itself wasn't that impressive. (We visited a couple of weeks after heavy rains though). We went there on our way to Sembuwatte Lake and spent only around 20 mts there. (Hence our rating reflects only what we thought of the waterfall and the surrounding view.) Beautiful waterfall especially during rainy season. However the pathway is slippery so watch out and also be careful with the Leeches. Carry salt water or sanitizer. Try to always get a guide to take you. They are simple folk at the ticket office. We were taken by Vishwanathan. Wear good shoes which have a decent grip. It’s a very short walk but best be safe than sorry! Beautiful waterfall. It falls in 2 sections and when combined it is very wide. Recently some development activities have happened here to market this place as a leisure park. Some huts with sitting areas, a natural pool and changing rooms are available. But it’s not worth the 100 rupees entrance fee you have to pay. You can also walk up very closer to the waterfall. Parking area is also available. This waterfall gives a soothing taste for a sour eye. really is a beautiful waterfall. Be informed that if you are going near waterfall you have to buy a ticket of 300/= which is in my point of view not a reasonable charge. Be aware of leeches in raing season A group of 15 of us, travelling with ‘Flamingo Lanka Tours’ visited the lower reaches of the Hunnas Falls, situated at Elkaduwa in Matale District.  We travelled by coach up to the parking area.  The entrance fee payable at the simple office at the entrance gate costs Rs 100 per person.  After purchasing the ticket, we walked along the designated path towards the upper reaches of the falls.  Although we were advised to take precautions, we encountered only a few leeches, possibly because it was a dry morning. You can see the falls from a distance as you come along the main road.  The falls consist of two sections that are distinctly different.  At the bottom of the falls is a small pond and a little hut where you can sit and enjoy the view.  The water fall is about 40 metres high.  The virgin beauty is unaffected as there are no commercial buildings nearby.  The path by the side of the falls is moist and slippery and visitors need to be careful of the thorny bushes along the way. We stayed here for about 90 minutes enjoying the quiet, the scenic beauty and the monkeys! We had a visit there while staying at Amaya Hunas falls, Hunnasgiriya waterfall is of two parts, upper and lower. Upper part is about 5m high and is situated within the hotel premises(2nd pic). Lower water fall is of 65m of height, comparatively larger (1st pic) and more beautiful. Both are real beauty of nature. Highly recommend to have a visit there. The most thrilling and amazing place I've been. For best experience you have to go ito the water fall. Safe place. you can see them and take your picture from the road, i dont know if its worth to walk to get closer Most of the picture posted here had a very good angle 😜 it‘s a nice waterfall, but there are not many places to hang out. As you cannot really swim at the waterfall, they built a little rock pool, which looks a bit forgotten and is not very inviting to swim. If you pass by, it may be worth a shot, but don‘t expect a mind blowing waterfall to spend a day. really a wonderful place, went there on my way to Sembuwatta, in the dry season water is less but massive water in the rainy season. I loved the environment and its nature.. Entrance Fee: 100 Good place for photography and selfies... Great place to spend the day, have a dip in the pool. This is along the Elkaduwa, Wattegama Road. a car could easily get to the entrance point. I wish to visit this place again, then will do another write up with more things of leisure. by the way special tour packages can be arranged for ladies/ family and cooperate events. Please call: 0750797356 Strange that its not so popular place. But its good! :) Fantastic nature around and no tourist. U can visit also Amaya Hunnas Fall hotel. Great place for relax with a beast view. We just went there on our way to Amaya Hunnas Falls. There's a ticket counter the price was 100 LAKE. Inside there's a good area for lesure activities. You can do in groups to spend the day like. We got two packs of lunch there had it in the cool breeze of water fall. You.cam even have adip in the cold water and there's a place to even play music. Hunnasgiriya Waterfall (or Hunas Falls as called by many) is really a beautiful waterfall. It is highly recommended to visit this place. You can reach so close to the waterfall easily via the footpath. You can also have a bath at the built pool below the waterfall. You have to travel about 3km after turning from Elkaduwa Road. Vehicle parking is available at the entrance. You will have to buy entrance tickets. Hunnasgiriya Waterfall is situated close to Sembuwatta Lake. We drove for over 30 minutes from a main road to get to the Hunnas Falls, there is now a ticketing desk to see it up close and swim at the base. We stopped on the road but can see the natural beauty from anywhere. Being locals no one was there to hassle us to buy any tickets. We stopped on our way Hunas Falls by Amaya for a swim and lunch. It is a very relax and mind blowing place to go. The environment is cannot describe, it's feels like you are in a jungle with all the luxury facilities.",4.5,19,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/19/57/ff/ea/hunnasgiriya-waterfall.jpg?w=700&h=400&s=1,0.0,33.33333333333333,0.0,0.0,33.33333333333333,33.33333333333333
Isinbassagala,"Isinbassagala. This is an ancient temple located on the side of the A9 road between Anuradhapura and Medawachchiya, but very little remains from original constructions.  Thus, from an archeological perspective, the place would get 3 stars. But considering it as a stop over on the way to Jaffna and the very easy access, being literally on the side of a main road I would give it 3.5 half stars. The main attraction today is the newer stupa built atop a rock outcrop and the 360 degree view it offers. There is a car park on the side of the road and a few smalls kiosks from where you can get tea and cold, fresh local orange juice mixed with a sprinkling of pepper (ideal on a hot day). From there you can climb up to the stupa. For the most part there are no steps but the slope is quite gentle and it's a short, easy climb. But do keep your shoes on until you get to the stupa, as the rock can get quite hot during the day. According to the monk we met at the top, the new stupa has been constructed on the site of an old Stupa destroyed by the Britishes who built a lookout post there. Nothing remains today of the old Buddhist constructions, expect for a Budhha's footprint carved in stone kept near the stupa (and a cobra head carved in stone which we couldn't find). The stories attached to the place comes more from folklore than any archeological or historical evidence and are both based on a translation of the Sinhala name given to the place. One version is that this is a place where ""isiwara"" or sages lived. Other version is that Arhat Mahinda (son of Indian Emperor Asoka who brought Budhdhism to Sri Lanka) arrived here by ""iridi"" power (I suppose you can say it's something like teleporting) before arriving at Mihintale where he would go on to meet King Devanampiyatissa. [Mihintale is not too far from here and in fact you can clearly see the two white Stupas at Mihintale from atop this rock.] According to this version, it is King Devanampiyatissa who constructed the Stupa here. There is a small building towards the back of the stupa. From there, there is a set of newly constructed steps that lead down to the temple premises. As we had done zero research before visiting we climbed back down the way we came. And then we asked around how to get to the temple....! So, based on the directions we got from the kiosks, we took the vehicle down the right turn you get just before the A9 Road entrance to Isinbessagala (this is coming from Anuradhapura side). It's a dirt road but was in very good condition and you have to drive only about 500 meters to get the temple. On the way there, you would another small Stupa on the side of the road, obviously of ancient origin recently conserved. Then you get to a quite well to do temple, with a several new constructions, right next to an ancient tank (wewa). The image house built in the 1930s - 1940s had some interesting statues and paintings. If you climb up to the rock from the temple you also come across quite a sizable banyan tree and an ancient cave dwelling (which is still in use), but we didn't have time to explore these as we were in a hurry to get back on the road. Must also mention that, when we got down from the vehicle wearing only socks, the monks told us to keep wearing shoes (probably because of the heat) which I thought was very considerate of them. Close to Madawachchiya. A must visit place if u are travelling to Anuradhapura. One of the earliest temples in Sri Lanka. Considered as the first stop of Arahath Mahinda thero , on his way to Mihinthale to meet king Devanam Piyathissa. Excavations of original stupa revealed a stone foot print replica of Lord Buddha and the previous religious item of stone cobra statue which u can still see in the temple. Very beautiful place with splendid scenery around  . This place is just an hour drive away from Anuradhapura. This hidden place is so important for the buddists as a religious place and for those who are interested in a nice veiw, this place is ideal. Its on the main road so its easily accessible and theres ample parking available. An ancient reservoir built by the kings of Sri Lanka. A peaceful area without much tourists and helpful village folk. Worth traveling little away from Anuradhapura to climb Isinbassagala. Nice view from the top of the mountain and it is a easy climb. You just have to climb steps. Better to climb in the morning or in the evening as the rock gets heated. Nice, peaceful place. If you travel form Anuradhapura, this is 40kms away along the Jaffna road. All roads are good and no off road drive. You Gould visit and seen the beauty of this place and get the Monk who lives in the rock to tell the story for you. You should listen... Lovely location.You can see some nice soruoundings. Dont forget to go to the temple on the other side as it has more to see.Like Arahath guhawa. Recommend to visit early morning or in the evening. This is not a well known or popular place amongst the travellers/pilgrims visiting Anuradhapura. I too was a bit skeptical about the visit because we had to travel about 25-30 Km along the A9 road from Anuradhapura but it was worth the effort. The view from the top of the rock was extremely scenic. Buddhists visiting the stupa located at the top of the rock:  Be sure to take flowers/oil/incense sticks from elsewhere because   none of those are available at the location. I and My University members (Tourism and Hospitality Management Badge 2010/2011, From Rajarata University) arrange a Excursion to visit Isinbessagala. It's a Hidden place as for tourism. But the Location is ideal for Cultural Tourism as well as for Sightseeing. There is a hidden story that, Arahath Mahindha thero visited here before went to Mihinthale to find the direction to Mihinthale. But any way it a typical rural village Sensurround by and the Sinhala concept of Village,Temple,Lake and Dhageba (Gamai, Pansalai, Wewai ,Dagebai) Show nicely this place. So if you visit go there before noon because sunshine is high....or go there afternoon... And there is an end-less Massive Na Tree.... Easy climb. Good location to stop on your way to North (Jaffna). Nice scenery. Relaxing location. Truly enjoyed the location. Isin Bessa Gala ""Ruwangiri Raja Maha Viharaya "" is Located approximately 2km away from Medawachchiya, which is a town in Anuradhapura. (Kandy Jaffna A9 highway). This temple was built by king Dewanampiyathissa, after introducing Buddhism to Sri Lanka by Arahath Mahinda (Mihindu) Thero. History says that Arahath Mihindu Thero along with other Buddhist monks first arrived to this historical place.  You could find a monument  of arrival of Mahinda thero, at the temple premises. Temple is situated on top a large rock where four other major Stupas including "" Ruwanweli Seya"" are clearly visible.",4.7,14,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/09/f5/40/88/isinbassagala.jpg?w=700&h=-1&s=1,0.0,18.181818181818183,0.0,0.0,18.181818181818183,63.63636363636363
Jaffna Market,"Jaffna Market. A must visit to grab all your Jaffna special Favs :) The vendors were friendly and gave very reasonable prices. Everything from palmyrah jaggery to the famous Odial :) Like most local markets, they are big, loud, dirty and so many options of the same thing. I always love wandering local markets, the fruit and veg is fresh, you get to haggle and take photos. This market really gave an insight into the locals. A nice market to walk through. The products are presented in a beautiful way. The market vendors are trying to sell their goods. In short, nice to go here. Colourful array of vegetables. Cheap. Make sure that you have enough small change of notes and be aware of pick pocketers If you are a westerner like me you will see fruits and vegetables that you have never seen before. No wonder the food taste different than restaurants in the west.Different types of Gourd and the most amazing unusual shapes of some of the things. Worth a visit if you are passing by. All kind of tropical fruits and vegetables available here. Fantastic experience! Best place for fresh vegetables and fruits! A market with all the essentials items. You can buy famous Jaffna sweets from here. The jaffna grapes, nelli syrup and the sweets made from fruits of the palm trees are very popular here. Vegetables and fruits also available. Specially the bananas are very cheap. A market just like any other that you find in South Asia, Jaffna Market gives you a nice peek into local life. Jaffna market is very famous among the locals and tourist. They sell everything made and grown locally in Jaffna peninsula. Highly recommended to visit. This is a local market you can find all you need at a good price. There are local Pointpedro flat vadai ,Palmyrah jaggery and local grapes. Unbelievable price , kind sales man, ample of things difficultly find where have to go and buy the thing. A wonderful array of fresh produce, spices, handicrafts and everything in between. Definitely worth a look. This is a locals market like any other. You can buy local products as well as fruits and vegetables. Jaffna market is famous for Nelli, juggery and herbs. In Jaffna you find the most cleanest railway station. Jaffna city is famous for many things like Mango, Nelli, juggery and some herb items. This is the place you can get all special jaffna items under one roof. prices are reasonable and you can negotiate with them. They respect outsiders and visitors. I love markets and this one was lovable. The fruit and veg are always colourful and the herbs and packeted items were new to me. Palmera flour   ..for example. Lots of bustle around and some nice and clean places for refreshment. Walked up there from fort and then proceeded to library then walked along coast road to amazing fishermen's row of houses which is by far best site in Jaffna This is your typical local market and has many interesting items for sale. We bought many items typical for this part of the county such as Nelli crush and Juggery. We also ate 'Jack fruit' from a vendor who cut the fruit open and gave us the inside pieces to eat, delicious! A colorful fruit and vegetable market where you can find fresh fruits and vegetable and authentic Sri Lankan products sweets, spices and household products. The market runs several bustling blocks that you can easily spend a few hours wandering around. As I  know this is one of the best market place in jaffna. You can find local sweats,  fruits,  vegetables,  cordials and few hand made items. This is a good place regardless of the old appearance or the less number of shops open, but because of the products being sold there. The 3 decade long civil war had forced people in jaffna to almost rely on what they cultivate and produce on their own, so that there are many unique local food items. Grape wine, Peanut biscuits and Cookies made from Sago, Palmyra Jaggery are some of the highlights. Prices are very reasonable and food has their own unique taste. A good place to take some food back. Yet another market but very well kept meaning that it is clean and all the different items that are for sale are neatly arranged. The salespeople are just great. No haggling what so ever and you will really have your time to look in to the things you are interested in. It is a pleasant market to visit in that way and well worth the time spent. One of the best things to do in Jaffna,  visiting the market gives you an idea of what every day life is like in Jaffna. You can see the fruit stalls, material shops and loads of palmyra baskets. Everyone is very friendly, it feels very safe and you don't get harassed to buy anything, plus the prices are incredibly cheap. The market starts on Power House Road, down from the big teaching hospital, and sprawls out into several side streets. Even if you don't buy anything just walking around and seeing the hustle and bustle is well worth it! A pleasant way to spend an evening. For us it was just a Rs.150/- ride in a tuk tuk ( 3 wheeler) from the Valampuri Hotel. The shops are open even around 7.30 p.m. Clothes, Jewellery, shoes, etc etc. Our purchases were minimal, a book to write in,  some pens, and two pairs of sandals.  A hive of activity, dogs running away from temple firecrackers, polite and friendly folk,  a tuk tuk driver who was not free to take us back, felt obliged to get us another one...good impression all round. Just keep to the side the road at all times. I visited the market during the latter part of the day people were friendly. There were a lot of local stuff to buy from which embeds their culture lead by tamils. I love the hand made stuff using Thal leaves... People were very friendly. They can talk little bit of English. There were various kinds of Palmyra products.Very cheep. Grapes in Jaffna is very sour. Lot of handmade food. Plenty of options for buying a sari or backpack if that is what you are after. Don't believe previous reviewer who claimed he was charged USD 2.00 for a mango. I found the stall holders in the fruit and veg section much less used to foreign visitors and I was charged much less for mangoes and fruit than at other markets in Sri Lanka. People were more curious and friendly than trying to get me to buy things at inflated prices. Local Jaffna cigars were also only 30 for a bunch of 10. For a European visitor it's well worth putting aside an afternoon to wander around the shops and stalls that make up Jaffnas's shopping area. Probably for someone from India or another part of Sri Lanka it'll all be pretty much business as usual but to me it's exotic. Plenty of places to stop for a drink and a rest when it all becomes too much. Only few shop opened, I try to buy sum  fruits, Oh  vary expensive. One Mangoes 2.00 USD Each. I thing batter place is cargils food city . Especially we found fresh vegetables and fruits. Those mangoes were so tasty but need more spaces for the market stores. 19th century British buildings provide more value to the existing new constructions. If you are in Jaffma, you must visit. There are lot of lovely Jaffna food items are available. Dry Fish and Jaffna curry powder must not be missed. The market you can find fresh fish, fruits and vegetables.  Lots of people most of the time that are going shopping.  If you are into fruits, I suggest mangoes, did you know that there are how many types of mangoes there are, there you can have and experience it! To buy homemade local snacks it's a good market. Vegetables and fruits (Specially bananas) also available. These narrow but deep stalls are on a fairly busy road with the footpath sometimes unavailable or not built in the first place. There was much fruit and many vegetables for sale along with a very good variety of fish and some hardware type goods. What struck me most apart from the searing mid afternoon heat was how languid the vendors were.  There was no effort to interest potential purchasers. That would never happen in Philippines! The Jaffna market is a small little bustling haven where one can buy fresh, locally grown fruits and vegetables and handcrafted goods often made from palmyra for reasonable prices. While the vendors are generally good and helpful people, I had the bad experience of being sold rotten fruit from a particular lady so be careful when dealing with people. Overall it is worth walking around here and if you're a foodie there's plenty of street carts selling crispy vadai (savory snack made from lentils) and roti. Best thing about this market is that you do not get sought after constantly like the markets in the south. A much more laid back approach and can somewhat shop in peace. Good prices with a large variety. I went to India a few times and love going to the market there. Jaffna Market was the first Sri Lankan market that I went on my trip and I found that they didn't want to negociate too much. On day when we visited this ever loving market of Jaffna - we found varieties of fruits, vegetables and many other products specifically reminding Jaffna (Yazhpanam) - as always has been. Visited the market just for curiosity, not a big market for such a large town, the vendors were friendly & helpful.It was a market like any other market in Sri-Lanka. Most Jaffna sweets & food made out of Palmyra Palm is available. The Colorful Fruit and Vegetable new market is refurbished and situated west of  the Jaffna Hospital and the Main Bus Stand.When I visited this place  it was full of fruit,Food ,Such as Palmy rah,Jaggery ,Sugar.items.Jaffna is famous for its bombay onion, chillies, plantains, beetroot and carrot cultivations.Fishing is another lucrative trade in Jaffna. Jaffna fishermen community earn a substantial income in fishing in closerby lagoons. The catch includes different varieties of fish such as sheer fish,  mullet, prawns, shrimps, crabs, lobsters and sea cucumbers. You can even find Big Crabs about 12"" -15"" long live too.If any one wants the fresh fish they have to be at the Jaffna Market at 6.A.M On the ally way to the Jaffna Fort and Municipality you find lots of Hand bags,Travel bags,sandals,belts children's clothes.There is plenty to shop around and bargain too.There were some Cinema theaters in the center and in front of the Bus Stand was completely vanished and became Cycle Park ( Rani Theater ) . Lots of jaffna made sweets products available for sale...jaffna tholaggatti kodial drinks are one of welknown products... ගොඩක් ලාබෙට බඩු ගන්න පුළුවන් තැනක්.තොග මිලට කිරලා ගන්න ඵළවළු පලතුරැ,මුරැක්කු,රසකැවිලි වගේ ගොඩක් දේවල් තියෙනවා.ප්‍රභාකරන්ගෙ ප්‍රියතම කෑම සත්ත වඩේ යාපනේ මාර්කට් ඵකට යන කෙනෙකුට ගන්න පුළුවන් Jaffna market specialises in palmyrah products (woven boxes,mats and bags, palmyrah jaggery/sugar etc) and also gingelly oil. You can also find locally grown dates and grapes as well as dried and/or deep fried chillies. I got some great wrist bands - 2 for Rs1.50..a total bargain!! Jaffna market is also close to Jaffna bus stand(station). From here, you can take a very cheap (CTB -- big,red, state-run buses) bus to Kayts, along the causeway which runs across the lagoon from Jaffna city/town to Kayts island. If you are in the least interested in bird-watching or sea/landscape, this is a journey not to be missed. The causeway is about 3/4 miles long ( and unfortunately at the moment, sections are being rebuilt - not that that deters the bus traffic at all) and on both sides there are marvellous birds everywhere-- especially during Dec-March period when the migrants fly in from the steppes. I saw brahmini kites hunting for fish; painted storks; the grey and the other heron; a flock of spoonbills paddling for small fish followed by baby cormorants picking up the remnants; and the clarity of the January light was marvellous .You need to go early morning before the sun climbs too high and flattens everything or just before dusk, when the sun lies low in the sky. If you have being to pettah market this is somewhat similar to that , you get good from perfume to electrical  and many more, but some of the sweets of course can only be found in Jaffna only most of them are made using the palm tree, very tasty and you can get many types fruits also Nagadipa Vihara is one of the 16 sacred places of Buddhist worship in Sri Lanka. According to the chronicles, in the 5th year after enlightenment, Lord Buddha visited Nagadipa to settle a dispute between two Nàga Kings - Chulodara and Mahodara regarding a gem studded throne. The Buddha preached the virtues of non-violence to the warring factions. He urged them to forget hating each other and be united. The two kings surrounded by their followers listened patiently to the Buddha and decided to end their enmity. After the two warring kings made peace the throne was offered to the Buddha, who returned it to the Naga kings. It was later enshrined in the Nagadipa Stupa and soon became a place of Buddhist veneration. Nagadipa later came to be referred to as Nainativu island with the settlement of Tamils in the island. This is the centre of local life in Jaffna, you can buy just about anything here - pots, pans, tobacco, beetel nut, tailors, fresh fish, dried fish, fruit and vegetables, clothing, groceries plus wandering cattle. Plenty to see, lots to photograph and mostly very friendly stall holders. Must see in Jaffna, not many tourists yet so most pricing is same as locals pay! Jaffna city has gone through a lot of transformation. The town is rather crowded during day time, but only a few foreign visitors were seen. There are good hotels now. Small eateries offering local and Chinese food is available in plenty around the town. Every need could be satisfied. The lagoon and fort are a must visit. There are Hindu Shrines, Buddhist Temples to be visited. This is the heart of the city, full of hustle and bustle , the place where see the colourful, spicy, shiny side of the city. There are vegetarian restaurants offering typical snacks and meals and drinks, gold shops galore in the Kannathiddy area  ( Kasthuria Road etc), spice shops, cigar shops, coffee shops, sweet shops etc. To get a genuine feel for the daily life of the Jaffna citizen take a walk around this area -- it's crowded but that's what a market is all about . Enjoy! We went four times with in two months, all items including local products are severely over priced. I twill be advised to buy it at major super markets in this area. If it is must better bargain the price. worth a visit for a sight seeing nothing much. The Jaffna Market is in the heart of the town. The best time to visit is probably in the evening when it is not too hot and pleasant to amble along and select the local produce from wine made in the area to Karthakolomban Mangos to locally made peanut biscuits!",4.0,66,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/29/57/75/88/caption.jpg?w=200&h=200&s=1&cx=1920&cy=1080&chk=v1_9a18a6214cb6ee7a7c1f,0.0,14.285714285714285,12.244897959183673,2.0408163265306123,30.612244897959183,40.81632653061224
Jaffna Public Library,"Jaffna Public Library. Housed in a beautiful colonial building, the library can be visited only in the afternoons between 4 and 6 pm. You are allowed to walk through the ground floor corridors and the India room, containing books donated by India as part of the library restoration. And that's about it. Shoes not permitted to wear inside the library. Really if you walk past and have time because it is not unforgettable. Really quite disappointed in the end. U An iconic symbol of Srilanka historic northern province Ancient literature and documents from renowned scholars and other professionals were preserved at the Jaffna Library, and served as a cherished depository for information on the history and culture of the northern peninsula. Worth visiting for the history due to the terrible events that burnt this place down. You can only visit the central areas but you get the overall impression. The outside and grounds are very nice. A visit to the Jaffna library is definitely recommended. Firstly us it a nice building inside are the rooms with books and the archive. Very nice to have seen. We wanted to take a look inside but it was Monday and the library was closed. We confined ourselves to the outside. A beautiful white building, one of the first buildings to be rebuilt after the Civil War, to symbolize the cultural revival of the city. Beautiful building from outside and gardens. You have to remove your shoes before entering. Limited access inside. Reserved for members. You can roam around certain areas and can see the stacks lof books. The outside is much more interesting. Like a phoenix risen from its ashes, this library is almost back to its old glory, and is recovering from the harrowing incident in 1981. Parking is available, and common visitors are allowed to read newspapers in the periodical section. Only members are allowed to roam the halls of bookshelves, like most libraries. Photos and videography isn't allowed A place of historical significance. Although a lot has changed inside. It is sad to have heard the extent of loss the building has endured in the past. The Jaffna Public Library is a cultural gem nestled in the heart of the historic city of Jaffna. Founded in 1933, this grand building is a testament to the city's love of knowledge and learning. With its stately columns, intricate carvings, and beautiful arched windows, the Jaffna Public Library is a true architectural marvel. Beautiful piece of architecture. Great to see it being restored. However no photography allowed inside. Not open to visitors because of COVID. Impressive from the outside but in a very busy area.  Scooter training school and test centere nearby worth spending time watching. It was always a dream to visit this place, as it was a very important landmark of the country's civil war. It was supposed to be one of the largest libraries in Asia. Great to see it built back again to its old glory The burning of the Jaffna Public Library (Tamil: யாழ் பொது நூலகம் எரிப்பு, Yāḻ potu nūlakam erippu Sinhala: යාපනය මහජන පුස්තකාලය ගිනිබත් කිරීම, Yāpanaya mahajana pustakālaya ginibat kirīma) took place on the night of June 1, 1981, when an organized mob of Sinhalese individuals went on a rampage, burning the library.[1] It was one of the most violent examples of ethnic biblioclasm of the 20th century.[Term][3] At the time of its destruction, the library was one of the biggest in Asia, containing over 97,000 books and manuscripts. =wikipedia = The Library does have a historic value for sure, but I don’t consider it a must-see venue, especially if you’re having a tight schedule. This public library was a gift from India in the 1950s. Damaged in the civil war it had now been restored and is open for business again Beautiful architecture and one of the largest library in Asia Before it was destroyed in 1981.The library was burned in June 1981 by an organised mob of Sinhalese before the civil war. It was re-built now and it  is historic and symbolic importance to many people in Jaffna.  Visitors must remove their footwear before entering the library and  no need to pay entrance fee. We couldn't see the written old dried palm leaves stored in special sandalwood boxes?? We could only view it from the outside. A landmark of the city, its facade, history and layout are striking! This famous library was damaged during the Civil war now fully restored The collection of books less than what was before. There was nothing to see no info, and a waste of time unless you want to simply celebrate the reconstruction after destruction. Was asked to remove our footwear for no obvious reason since a bunch of Asian visitors came thru fully shod! Speaking inTamil I leaned they had come through the back entrance. We went thither and duly walked thru in 5 mins , passing several no entrance signs. On exiting the same individual who seemed preoccupied with footwear commented on our non compliance! Being totally disappointed suggested he actually helps visitors discover what there is to see than running the footwear police. Public library is important visiting point for Tamils.  Library was burnt down in the racial riots and rebuilt recently. During the fire,  books & manuscripts which were lost cannot be replaced. Worth a visit for tourists whoever learnt/knew the racial hatred between Tamils and Singhalese.  It was built in a location where other touristy areas such as Jaffna fort, Pannai beach etc. Very closer to the Jaffna Town. One can walk to the library. Alas, this public library is only open to the public, from 4.30pm to 6pm. The original building and contents was burnt to the ground by the Sri Lankan army during the civil war. This is a pleasant building in the middle of Jaffna.  Visitors can have a look in the building, but are restricted from going into any of the actual rooms storing the books. Highlight is the facade and garden.  I wouldn’t make a special trip to Jaffna for this site, but if you have time it’s worth wandering to. Unfortunately the library was closed when we visited. It was once the largest collection of books around 97,000. It’s a beautiful building from the outside. Seventeen of us travelling as a group stopped over at Jaffna Public Library, along with our guide, in the evening of 6th July 2019. In front of the entrance of this elegant, spacious architectural building is the statue of Saraswati, the goddess of education, music and art. Situated in the middle of a lush well-maintained garden, the library is one of the most important landmarks in Jaffna. There were many students and others who had come here to use its facilities.  The level of maintenance and the degree of attention to library users displayed the dedication of the authorities and the staff. Unfortunately, the library is closed to visitors after the vicious attacks on churches and hotels carried out by Islamic extremists on 21st April 2019.  Only the members of the library are permitted entry.  We were permitted only to walk outside the building. I felt saddened to learn that it had been completely burnt down together with its priceless collection of books, palm-leaf manuscripts and historic documents during the civil war in June 1981.  The present library had been extensively and completely renovated and reopened to the public in 2003.  They are justified in closing it to the public to avoid a recurrence of those sad events. We are a family of 4 of 3 generations from Colombo & Sydney but were not allowed to enter the Library premises . The lonely security guard said that he has been given instructions by the Municipality despite the public notice at the entrance which states that visitors are allowed from 3.30 to 5 pm. So much for the country's wisdom to attract travellers despite the hard times. Situated near Jaffna fort re built recently as it was distroyed by fire about 40 years ago. Lot of the very old books were distroyed. We visited Jaffna Public library in our tour program. It's one of the biggest library in Sri Lanka,  has good collection of books in English. Building has beautiful architecture,  area around is green and nice. A place that you feel more happy when you see the library entrance and get to know more about everything about srilanka We popped in because it was open and free!  It's a victorian era public library with reading rooms etc.  Frankly it wouldn't be a tourist attraction in many other cities but Jaffna doesn't have many. Lovely traditional old library, brought back lots of childhood memories. There’s a lending station, a reading room and. children’s library to the rear. There’s nothing unduly special about it but it has great atmosphere and tradition. Public visiting is from 4:30 to 6:00 pm and it’s worth a stop if you’re passing. Pay heed to the visiting hours! Think during the day visitors are kept out as school kids are given access. The exterior was gorgeous, with a statue of Saraswathy, the goddess of knowledge outside, set in a beautiful garden full of flowers. Read the history behind this place- very interesting. First time I visited, I was able to go to the top floor and view the sun  set in an evening. It was not possible this time during my visit as the stairway to the top floor was closed, may be due to some construction work. Worth a visit to this place. Sad that it was burnt down in during past civil unrest. Can combine this with a visit to the fort. Visitors cant enter the main library. Couldn’t get very excited about this place. No doubt it’s a good place to study but for a tourist it is hot, not air conditioned and rather dull. The building however is quite impressive. This is a beautiful architectural building. There is a statue of learning in front.Visiting hours are restricted. The garden is beautiful. A good photo opportunity. Short experience as most of the library rooms are off limits for visitors. It's a shame to have had this place destroyed earlier, you can feel the enormous wealth of knowledge and history this place would have stored. Friendly staff and worth a short visit If TripAdvisor allowed to give no stars at all this is the place for which I have used it. A complete waste of time. They do not allow you to enter any of the rooms which houses the books.not even to know what kind of books they have. You are only allowed to have a walk through the building. I was really excited to see this place as in terms of books they have this is legendary in Sri Lanka. So when we first went it wasn’t time for visitors which is from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. So we came again at 4 because I wanted to see this place so much only to know that you are only allowed to appreciate the walls. If it is about a security reason you can keep a place guard to check at the ent of the tour. If you are not allowed to look at books what’s the point of permitting a visit. Never ever going to this place in my life. This is a beautiful white building near the Jaffna fort. Known to be the biggest library in Asia in past. destroyed in 1980/1 due to the civil war. Visitors are not allowed to use books though. The biggest library in Sri Lanka surrounded by a beautiful garden is located very close to the Jaffna clock tower, the tall white column and the police station on the way to Jaffna Fort. The library looks like a newly renovated building. one of the most popular library in Asia. Consider World well known library. Must visit in Sri Lanka. Full of knowledge Worth a visit to see something of local culture at play. No women in periodical reading room, tourists not allowed anywhere Toilet floors swimming in water abd no taps working 4 security men at entrance Did look nice if allowed in Nice building, well renovated but poor content: you can just walk into a few corridors and cannot enter departments: you will not see much not see many explanations. But important historical place in Jaffna. open from 9am to 17hrs.Entrance is free of charge.we find the all the books.there are two areas.Indian and sri lankan section.photographs not allowed inside the library This is one of Jaffna‘s most prominent landmarks. The library was built in 1933 and got destroyed in 1981 during the civil war. This was known to be one of the largest libraries in Asia back in 1980's that had around 100,000 books and other relevant material. After the destruction that took place in the 80's, it was renovated in 2001 and today, it is the second main public library in the island. It was funtastic experience visiting the library, saw how the micro film reader works, yazh, india corner...must visit place .very quite and people are getting benefitted... We visited this place since we had time to kill. Did not undertake a tour of the premises but spent the time reading. They have the entire range of local newspapers to read. Also magazines. They are open to public for reading only from 4.30 to 6.30 p.m. This could have been for a longer duration or the whole day. The library is located in a beautiful campus. Unfriendly staff. Limited rooms for tourists to visit. Not very public at all. Not worth going inside. Jaffna public Library is Sri Lanka's prominent and biggest library. Before the war there were many books and once it was south asia's biggest library as well. Public can visit inside. Photos and videos not allowed. Two stories building. must visit place in Jaffna this a public library and visitors only can visit 04.30 pm - 06.30 pm Mondays library is closed and please avoid on Mondays I was not allowed inside as it was a holiday that day. But from he outside i can make out that it must be a nice place inside too. Just went there for taking photos and couldn't visit inside. It is a nice building and must visit if you travel to Jaffna. Mostly famous within Sri Lanka. The place could be easily visited along with the other attractions in Jaffna. We were unable to enter the building, because foreigners may visit only from 4.30pm. But it was a joy to behold from the gate, surrounded, as it is, by beautiful trees and gardens. And of course, in a sense it is a symbol of peace. This place is a must for all those wishing to learn war about the origin and history of the ethnic conflict. Re-built in 2002, this is a wonderful white building housing the new library whose books were destroyed We tried to visit when we first arrived in Jaffna but discovered it doesn't open to foreign visitors until 4:30pm. We came back a couple of days later and when we went inside discovered that we could only walk through the hallways - all the actual rooms in the library are off limits to foreigners. You can't take photos, there are no information signs or guides - there really isn't much to do. It's a shame as this library plays a big part in Sri Lanka's history and could be a really interesting attraction - perhaps it is still a little early after the war. Non locals discouraged from entering but I suppose there is a couple of casual photo snaps of you are wandering past. Could be so much better. It's really a most wonderful place in Jaffana (Srilanka). One of the famous library in the world. Very rare and vaulable book you can read here. All the sections are closed to visitors, so you can only admire the building facade, walk the corridors and see closed doors What is interesting is the statue of Goddess Saraswati - the Hindu Goddess of learning at the front Avoidable It only has historical legacy nothing much to see in present days. Make a visit in your half day city tours in Jaffna city. Can cover this max in 30 min upon arrival to library First we came on a wrong day, then on a right day it was at a wrong hour. Then we came at 15:30 and it turned out that it opens at 16:00. Anyway, we waited and went in. Most of the halls were off-limits and could not be entered by us. There was hardly anything else to see except some corridors and insight into halls, and, of course, some pictures from the terrible fire during war times. I feel sorry to give such a poor remark and I feel sorry for what has happened to this building in the past. But if they responsible people from now want that this building is admired by the general public, they should also open it (more) to the public. I visited this library after a long time and it is good to see it is functional again. Not sure the quality of the books though. Please not, you need to remove your foot wear before you enter the building. Did not get to visit inside since the break time is between 1 to 4 which was a travesty because we went at 330 You are welcome to call in and look but there are rooms where you cannot enter. One of the better public buildings of Jaffna but not sure why we visited!! Was a break in Jaffna and the library is close to where we stay. It’s an historical structure with lord Saraswathy ( god of knowledge in Hinduism) at the main entrance . worth to see when in Jaffna The Jaffna library lacks the staff to give guided tours or have handouts regarding it's importance. This is one of the best libraries in the country & none of the local authorities are interested in developing it A visitor is only allowed to view the passages & the reception area. The Jaffna library built in 1933 was burnt in 1981 and is a horrific reminder of the ethnic tension of the 80s. Over 97000 valuable manuscripts were destroyed (Seneviratne, 2006). It has now risen to being a new, vibrant library with areas for children, youth and is an interesting place. It is a must visit site for all locals to be reminded of the horrors of ethnic biblioclasm and to be challenged to think ""Never Again"" shall such a thing happen in Sri Lanka. One of the standout buildings in Jaffna with a sad history.  Unfortunately visitors only have access to the main corridors of the building.  So fifteen minutes will do it.  If you are staying longer than a few days it may be worth joining as apparently the wifi is excellent. The children's park across the road is quiet and cool to stop for a rest. Photographs in the library show the destruction it suffered during the civil war and it is remarkable that it has been restored Externally the impressive colonial architecture provides Jaffna with a remarkable landmark Internally not quite so impressive with many of the rooms off limits to casual visitors However, the atmosphere harks back to libraries of yesteryear with long shelves lined with books and a reverential hush reinforced by prominent ""Silence"" notices posted throughout the building There is history behind this place and worth the visit. Its is very creditable that it has been rebuilt and slowly getting back to its old glory. Lots of intellectuals have gone through this place and have benefited. It was nice to look around though not allowed to go inside. This Library has been restored to its early glory, and contains a vast collection of valuable books.   It also acts as a centre of learning for the local students.  restricted acces to visitors. It is a nice building, not really special. For me the most interesting was to see how proud they are about this building and how they use it. People are reading newspapers, there are archives, etc.. Architecturally a significant building with lovely laid out gardens. If you are visiting this place do yourselves a favour and avoid the frustration of being turned away from seeing anything but the corridors inside the building! Visiting Hours are limited to a couple in the evenings. It is clear that the staff here see visitors as an annoyance, they will not answer any questions and will simply walk away. There are signs everywhere that say 'Visitors Not allowed'. Best to take a couple of photos from the outside and move on. The exterior looks a lot better than the interior. There is really nothing to see here. It is a good place walk around after visiting the fort. But definitely not a can't-miss attraction. We have been told by the hotel owner to go there and we did. More than the building itself, it is observing the Which is pretty interesting! As tourists/visitors are not permitted to enter you only to see the library sections from the desk at the entrance. There are som interesting photos from the days of the blast of the place. Do take a stroll around the buildning to enjoy the architecture and the garden. Have a snack/ drink/ meal from the library restaurant before leaving it's sad during d war many rare books treasures etc were burnt n distroyed. Also it's was damaged  now re buit it again. This was one of the biggest disappointments, as its such a hyped-up place. The visiting hours are restricted (between 4:30-6pm and you can only visit 2 small reading room areas - and everything else is closed to visitors! You might as well keep your shoes on (yes, its a library where you have to take off your shoes!!!) and look at the building from outside and save yourself the bother of going in. Not worth it at all. I must have had a persuasive driver because I am unmistakenly a (white!) foreigner but was allowed in the library in the morning. I was able to have a good look round including a close look at the impressive array of books in the English section. There is also an Indian section recognising the close affinity between Jaffna and Southern India. The building is beautifully restored after the civil war. There were few people in the library but there was total silence and an air of learning just like I remember from English libraries in my boyhood. Nostalgia for a bygone age, a feeling of reconciliation after a bitter civil war and a building restored to its former glory all combine to make this a noteworthy place to visit and a welcome change (for me) from temple after temple. It's a great asset for local people and I could happily have browsed for half a day. It was my favourite place in Jaffna. I was privileged to have a chance to see it as a working library and it will always be difficult for the authorities to balance this with an opportunity for tourists to visit. The Jaffna Public Library is a tourist destination when visiting the city.  Unfortunately, it is only open after 4:00pm for foreign visitors.  Therefore, you should plan accordingly if you choose to visit.  The grounds are spectacular with an assortment of flowers adorning them.  This building was rebuilt after it was damaged during the war. The building is nice and the grounds are pretty. Only locals are able to access the collections in the library though so don't expect to actually be able to read anything. I spent a bit of time here in the afternoon and it's a great place to get away from the hustle and bustle of central Jaffna There are visiting times from 4-6. Very close to the town- in the town itself I would say, jaffna fort, library, nallur kovil, rio ice cream all are nearby. Unfortunately they dont allow you yo walk inside the library very much! But you can read some history and get a glimpse of the inside of the building. You can spend about 30 minutes here overall. Visitors only allowed between 4:30 pm and 6 pm and the not actually allowed into any sections to see any books. Hardly public library more like a private members only. Gardens were nice but I would not waste my time I did not entered the library, but it is a beautiful and big building between the fort and the city center. Start your visit of the city by the markets and the kovils of the city center, than go by foot to the fort (the library is in the way) to the sunset!! The newest station  having also the newest tracks as recently reopened after the civil war gives you a good welcome and there is no hussle with tuktuks or taxis Closed on public holidays and Poya days. You'll find the clock tower in front of the the library and the dutch fort is also few meters away from the library. good. it is opens only for few hrs. so we missed. bad luck. for us okay. but better to open it at least for foreigners for the whole day Very impressive little colonial building that was devastated during the civil war and is now renovated and back in use. One of the best kept libraries in this country. A one time ""best library"" of the Asian region. Well that's history. Its prim and kept in a check. One needs to remove his/her shoes to enter. That's a mark of respect and to avoid disturbance. Most of the reading areas are not accessible to visitors, and permits only members. Kind of disappointing for an avid reader though, thus the visit was a shirt spin around for exterior selfies and angle shoots. Its only a landmark for a visitor. The Public Library was burned down in June 1981 and is viewed as in of the defining moment of the Sri Lankan civil war.   More than 90,000 books, documents and ancient palm leaf books were destroyed.  It was viewed as aimed at the Tamil culture. The building has been rebuilt and is beautiful.  Unfortunately, it wasn't open when we visited.  It opens in the evenings only. Before it was burned in the early 80's, Jaffna Library was a treasure of Tamil culture and knowledge. The modern reconstruction is a reminder of this former glory. Jaffna Public Library , Sri Lanka One of Jaffna's most notable landmarks, it is run by the Jaffna Municipal Council. The library was built in 1933 and burnt in 1981. During the early 1980s, it was one of the biggest libraries in Asia, containing over 97,000 books and manuscripts.In 2001, rehabilitation of the library was completed, with new structure being built and new books received, although its old books and manuscripts were not replaced. It is Sri Lanka's second main public Library only rivaled by the Library in Colombo The building's classical lines and beautiful proportions make it stand out architecturally. It contains lush gardens and has been modernized with new facilities such as free-wifi Visitors time is 4.30-6.30pm, But if you are solo or couple you should be able to visit the reading section and get permission to visit other areas. Please maintain silence and observe the rules. Good selection of books. Nice system. Definitely a place to see a good collection back again The library was built in 1933 and burnt in 1981. But now it's almost renovated and only picture and posters remains. I would say there is nothing much to see now. It will be only opens at 4.30pm to 6pm only A place filled with memories. Once known to be the largest library on the country and later burnt down by the terrorists with a lot of books to be found only in the Jaffna library. Rebuilt and back on its glory.. The exteriors of this building has been beautifully restored. Inside, you can see some old pictures of how the building looked like before it was damaged before the start of the civil war. It's also interesting to see locals inside the library reading books and newspapers. It's a good place to visit for half an hour. Completele gutted in 1981, it's valuable collection of books and manuscripts redused to cinders, this beautiful building has been restored and lovingly refilled with books in the years following the war. The surrounding gardens are weel-kept and beautiful. It's a quiet oasis for book-lovers, and garden-lovers alike. The Jaffna library has been restored to its original architecture after the war.  It is very well looked after with great gardens and excellent view of Jaffna. You are allowed to go inside the library but required to leave your foot wear outside.  The place a great importance of learning so their way of showing respect is to walk without foot wear.  From a practical perspective this reduces the noise levels and the need for regular cleaning of the library. First of all the gardens seem like a little slice of Eden in the heat of a Jaffna mid morning. Managed to get in before the actual visiting hours which are from 4-6pm. Nice to see that the library has strict rules and study and reading are the first priority. Have to take your shoes off to enter the building. There's a fascinating mix of literature within its walls with most books quite old and providing interesting view points on their subjects. There is a reference room but requires membership to enter. Lovely grounds to stroll through and definitely would recommend a visit while you're in Jaffna The library only opens after 4:30pm, so please don't go if you want to go inside to have a look. It is close either 6pm or 6:30pm.. can't remember .. It is quite a shame that most sections are not open for visitors. Everyone have to remove their shoes before entering. It is interesting to see that they seperate male and female reading rooms. Male is downstairs and female one is upstairs. No photograph is allow inside, and so can't share any photos. Wow.. some priceless books also in this library.. and nice place..  This library gave me a good feeling. One of the best library in sri Lanka this is. nothing else to say  anything... The library is only open to visitors from 4.30pm to 6.00pm for free each day except public holidays and then you are only permitted to enter the reading room on the ground floor. There is not a lot to see other than a couple of photographs at the library entrance showing the damage after the library contents were burned in 1981, one of the incidents to spark the civil war. However it is a very impressive building with lovely landscaped gardens surrounding it. The Library is very big. However nothing much for a visitor to see as only a small section is open to public. Understand that public visiting the reading areas would disturb the users however maybe tours should be arranged with a guide when library is closed. The Jaffna Public Library is advertised as one of the sights to see in Northern Sri Lanka, During the civil war the Library which was even then one of the hallmarks of Jaffna was burnt down and now rebuilt. I had sent some books to Jaffna for the library, so I looked forward to seeing it. I went on a Sunday morning and was told it was closed, so I made an arrangement,  after a conversation with the man at the gate, to come in early the next morning. I arrived at 9am and was told that visitors were allowed only after 4pm. I explained to the only one who could speak in English that I was from Australia, and that I had an interest in seeing the complex. I still had the same reply. In the end they let me through but showed no interest in my appearance there. I did not see all of it to make any comment. I felt that I was being treated as a inconvenience to be tolerated, and so I left. If you advertise something as a tourist attraction the you should make arrangements to make sure your visitors are made welcome. I do not think I will go back there and while I wish them success I will not personally contribute. It didn't opened when I went there. Seems it would be open between 4-7 or so, but not in the noon. Worth a visit. One of the oldest libraries in south east Asia now renovated after an unfortunate incident during the insurrection. Lovley library but few areas off limits for foreigners  lovley building n gardens  not far from town and fort Nothing much to see. you can wander inside the building. But you have to take off your shoes before you enter it. But most of the areas of the building are prohibited to the travelers. It is understandable because it is a library. Well worth a visit in the late afternoon to wander through the rooms and end up on the balcony overlooking the gardens. Beautiful building restored after its destruction by racist forces, incredibly important both historically and symbolically. You cannot take photos inside because it is still a functioning library, but you can peek. Having Sri Lankan parents, they raved about  the library for a long time and were proud for what it stood for. But visiting for the first time as a 'foreigner' there are signs telling you that the books area is forbidden. This is absurd. In no other country are you told to not read a book in a library. They told us that certain visitors come and destroy the books but that's why there are employees and security personnel. Waste of time which is upsetting as this is my heritage Jaffna Public Library is supposed to be the biggest in whole Sri Lanka. There are many different sections - some of them are prohibited for tourists, but one friendly librarian showed me them anyway. Recommend it if you are strongly interested in books and reading, otherwise it won't be interesting to you. From the balcony you can see the Cricket Stadium and Jaffna Fort. The library is also opened for visitors every day from 4.30 p.m. until 6 p.m., so please not go there in the morning. Opening hours are from 4-6pm only. We were there in the morning and had other plans for the afternoon, thus missed visiting it. The Public Library has some of the oldest manuscripts and documents of the region and of the Tamil language, so we were disappointed to have missed going in. We visited there in the morning which we didn't have any clue that the visiting hours are in the evening. The security wasn't friendly and had a rude tone telling us that we should visit in the evening. Inside the library looks like any other library. The architecture from the outside is nice to watch. Socrates said that the first victim of the war is truth, and it is equally true that places of learning and art also suffer greatly in war as a deliberate attempt to  damage the collective memory This was once one of the greatest  libraries in Asia, containing  97,000 books and manuscripts and much of it was burnt in the civil conflict. It has  now been painstakingly restored, and once again looks beautiful but the loss of burnt books cannot never be compensated. We were only able to go into the main hall, where the periodicals are kept. It was like entering another time zone - the furnishings, the building - the entire ambiance.  Definitely a site to visit.  The grounds are spectacular. i lucked out arriving the day and time that the library was putting on a play, also i explored the building. very nice place and worth visiting. This is a very famous and great Library in Sri Lanka. Built in ancient time. It was burnt during the war in 1981. Now it is completely recovered. There are nearly 100,000 books. This library is the most peaceful with a large array of books and a wonderful view of the sea on the second floor. Extremely peaceful for people who want to unwind. We were very disappointed with the interior. It was not set up for visitors and most rooms leading from the corridors were out of bounds for tourists The building itself is nice and history behind it very heavy, but besides taking a picture of the building there is not much to see there. Access is limited to members only. Why not if you have extra time, it's next the fort entrance. The was destroyed years back and now fully  renovated. This has a very large collection. Visitors are allowed to go in after 4 pm and restricted to a selected area See above. Building is great, just cannot get anywhere inside which was disappointing. If they could open a couple of sections, as I would have really liked to have seen some of the older books etc. Jaffna Library was burnt down during the civil war and recently fully renovated. It is a must visit site for travellers going to jaffna Great location near the fort and interesting for what it is hoping to replace: the building itself as well as the collection. What a pity the original had gone. Once a legend that was smashed down by piety politics but glade it stands again as we have heard in past. it will serve our nation more than before The visit to the library was a excellent trip.The library looks attractive after the renovation some years back.This library is world famous with a large collection of books.Very famous persons visited the library in Jaffna.The location is maintained properly. No visit to Jaffna would be complete without a visit to the well known Public Library, seeped in history and .... misfortune. The building, together with its valuable collection, was destroyed twice but now the Library stands tall, a beacon of knowledge in the north of Sri Lanka. Among the special sections are : the Sri Lanka collection and a room dedicated to Indian publications. The children's section is bright and colourful with a lot of activity on the Saturday morning that we visited. Visitors are required to remove their shoes before entering the Library. If you are hoping to see the excellent book collection, please become a member. You can get a temporary membership at the counter. Otherwise, all you can do is admire the building and its gardens. This place is very popular with locals. This is a historical place in jaffna. A lot of books are here. And rare once also. Nice architecture of building. This Library is one of the Best In Asia. This has variety of rare books. Very popular with the public. This an Icon in Jaffna. Given the historical significance of this place it is worth visiting. Don't miss the photos of the damage from 1981 above the doorways in the reception area. But it is, more than anything else, a working library and a visit doesn't take more than 15 mins. At the moment there is a little exhibition outside on 60 years of Sri Lanka in the UN. We were allowed to walk around the grounds of the library, but were not allowed to enter the building, as visiting hours were late afternoon only. There was a very interesting exhibition outside,  on the work of the United Nations in Sri Lanka. First of all its open to visitors only between 4:30-6! It's a nice place to see but I was expecting a whole lot more space/ rooms with books.... But there are some things you can see and even learn.... The structure is magnificent!! This is a must see see place in Jaffna as it is one of the key sites that jaffna is known for. There are very specific visiting hours from 4.30pm to 7pm. Most of the library halls are closed to visitors, but you can take a quick peep through the doors. Gleaming white under the Sri Lanka sun, the building's classical lines or colonial style stands proud in the Northern City of Jaffna.  The building itself has beautiful proportions and make it one of the architectural standouts of the South Asia region.  What is not appreciated is that during the Civil War this building was reduced to ashes so many times.  A war torn region this building represents the Phoenix Like rebuilding of a war torn area.  Originally this library had one of the most eclectic collections of books ranging to about 97,000 books and articles pertaining to the Tamil Life and History. All sadly destroyed. Now things are returning to normal - what ever normal can be in this day and age.  Worth a visit but I would allow no longer than 1 hour if that to wander round the existing building. Looks quite an impressive building but the day we visited it was closed ,so we went to the cafe for afternoon tea & cake it was fairly full as folks where taking there driving tests in a field opposite driving round traffic cones!!!!!!!!!!does that explain the erratic driving  me thinks,they all seemed pleased they passed came to celebrate over a soda. Building is kept clean and well maintained. Its a Historic Place. Having had a bad experience 3 decades ago, now the place has come back to its origin. Well done. Staff good. Unwanted elements are not found. Visitors enjoy their visit. Its worth it. Though the collection is less (it was burnt down in 1980s), the renovated library (with foreign foundations) has excellent architecture, good furniture, excellent children's wing, Computer wing and a good park outside to relax. Portiobs are air conditioned. An excellent place to visit Beautiful building from outside, nice garden,easy to find, visitors are not allowed to go the ""sections""...so basically you can walk only in corridors...but will not take you more than 15 minutes. One time graded as the best in South Asia but lost almost all the manuscripts and invaluable collection of books. Visiting time is 4.30 pm so those who would like to go there, please arrange your schedule according to this. Good to see the well maintained garden as Jaffna is a challenging place for this kind of green. Libraries are always nice place to have a break from the city life and get quiet and learn some more. The library is open for public viewing only from 4.30 pm to 6 pm. You can walk through a few public areas on the ground floor and the first floor. Although the building is quite nice, do realize this has been completely rebuilt after the civil war, so it's historic value is a bit less than meets the eye... You can skip going inside if you're in a hurry as the inside offers a standard public library with entry to the sections prohibited for visitors. You are able to see some pictures of the building before the restoration inside if it interests you Visitors can visit daily from 4.30 - 6 pm but if you did happen to miss these times, don't feel that you've missed out, It's just a huge building but hardly anything to see inside. Didn't see one book! Very sadly there is little inside as all the treasures were burned by arsonists. The architecture of building must be seen. No need to spend too much time here It's one of the best libraries at south asia. You need to remove shoes before entering to the library. Nice place to visit but unfortunately we picked a day when it was not open to tourists so only got a quick peak round the outside. Next trip will plan better to take a look on the inside! There is not much left from the Original building. After the war the library is rebuilt but lots of old Tamil documents are damaged or burnt. In the building itself it is prohibited to make pictures and the sections are not open for public. You can climb the stairs to 1st floor to enjoy the view. The corridors on the ground floor are free to visit and so you can glimpse a little in the sections. That is about all. So, from the outside it is a beautiful piece of architecture but from the inside it is rather disappointing. Even after it was burnt down by the time of conflict  , today Jaffna public library stands still after renovations,this building it self resembles the perseverance and strength of city's people,by standing tall in the middle of Jaffna city. .Library is not open to tourists  on Mondays, other days except week ends it's opened to tourists after 4.00 PM, Once in side the library you are given limited access to the library, as a visitor you are not able to see all the rooms with books or sit and read a book, you are only given a chance just to see the reception area, a hall way leading to a computer room. However the library is one of the must see places in Jaffna as it is a historic building. This library was destroyed during the war and now its rebuild to reflect the past glory. We couldn't visit inside the library as we arrived at a time where it was closed. But we enjoyed looking at the building. The rebuilt library is certainly an impressive building. No photos are allowed inside and many of the rooms are not accessible to visitors. The periodicals room is very good though with lots of english language things to read. The history if this library is fascinating and that alone is worth a visit.This is where it all started in terms of Sri Lankan civil war in force. Tamil heritage manuscripts *palm leaves) and about 91,000 volume of books involving Tamil history was burnt to ground by mob (with the blessing from official government) in the early 80's. After the war ended about 6 years ago, Janna people built the library first. It is an amazing testament to the Tamil's intellectual and will power.The building from outside is pretty to look at. The only problem is tourists can not get access to anywhere but the reading room. There are photos of NY Public Library, Library of Congress and Columbia University's library which is my husband's alma mater and my husband is a retired professor/founder of the Dental School in Stoney Brook in NY. I asked him to go to the front desk, introduce himself and ask if we can go inside to see the collection. It was very easily granted. What was disconcerting is how they are now storing the donated palm leaf manuscripts. They were very kind to open the cabinet and let us touch (we did NOT) but we were horrified to see that these manuscripts are not even properly folded. They are just piled up, dis organized, collecting dust. Rest of the rooms have some Tamil and some English books and no, it is not a world class collection. However, how does one tiny city in a tiny country rebuild a world class library after losing 91,000 volumes of its heritage? I almost wept in emotion. Thia is a amazing Library, one must visit when in Jaffna and the pathetic story was during 1980's this place was set fire due to an ethnic issue in the country and there was very unfounded books were burnt. Well maintain Library in Sri Lanka and pretty nice location in Jaffna it's a huge building in Jaffna with a bit of a history. It was worth a photo. I wouldn't plan too much time here. The Jaffna library has come a long way. it was set on fire in 1983 because of ethnic tensions and most of its valuable and historic Tamil scriptures were destroyed but it has been rebuilt and its modernization is impressive. There was a hidden art gallery on one of the floors which is worth finding. Was a good place to visit but access to most of the places are restricted apart from the reading rooms. Not much to see on the inside. With visitor hours being 16:30 - 18:00, if you can't make it inside during those hours, you're not missing too much. Just about every corridor is closed for visitors. But, since it's free I can't complain too much! Beautiful architecture but recently restored due to bombing in the civil war. Historical photos available for public viewing showing how it was and when it was bombed. If you go upstairs make sure you go out onto the balcony at the front. There is a lovely view overlooking the gardens. Well worth the adventure. An amazing symbolic structure that amazes you with its outside an inner beauty. And both the old and new story of it is a vital part of understanding the history. This is one of the most popular place in the Northern province of Sri Lanka - Jaffna. This library was the one of the biggest in early 80s in Asia and then burnt in 1983. This is one of the symbol of the conflict affected people. Though the building is renovated and reopened for public, the people still carry their inner wounds as unhealed. This was a nostalgic trip for us and revisiting places that our grandparents frequented was a wonderful experience. The staff were very understanding and accomodating. Highly recommend a visit Historic building, bring sadness to anyone getting to this library was burnt once with so many Historic books. Let history not repeat itself It was good to see this famous building brought back to its old glory. Was able to do a tour inside. The library is well equipped & modern now. It was nice going up to see the view of the surrounding area, from the balcony. The downside of the place is a dirty canal that is at the entrance to the library, which  has not been cleaned up  for ages, as foreign tourists  & children visit the library, the canal  should be cleaned up soon,  it is a health hazard &  very ugly as it is at the entrance. A lovely, proud building with an important story behind it. As with so much in Jaffna (apart from the busy market), it is quiet and unassuming and worth visiting, even if for just a cursory stroll. An important symbol of Tamil identity, read up on its history; it will make the visit even better. A good reading room as well. A modern building built on the ruins of the previous Library which was burnt down with all the ancient manuscripts. To see but i would not recommend a visit, it's a library. I attended a forum here. The facilities were modern, the sound system was up to date, the room was air-conditioned - a nice venue for business and education. they day we went they said it was not open to foreingeners ? till 4pm but we never had enuff time to go back ., great looking building tho ..good luck getting in Jaffna Public Library is one of the main attraction of Jaffna located in the Jaffna City Centre itself, along Jaffna Dutch Fort and British Clock Tower. This is the second largest library in south Asia which was built 8 decades ago back in 1933. The locatian in the city center allowes any visitor to view the beauty of the unique architecture of the libray and the valuable contents. Although, a remarkable amount of books were lost during the confict lasted for more than 03 decades, the renovated building and collection of books gives a new look for the library now. The library is closed for public on Monday and there is no entrence fee. More information about Jaffna Public Library can be seen at www.jaffnalibrary.lk. Well tended garden, imposing building and a restored library after all its literary resources were destroyed in a fire. The library has many books and has a vast assortment of readers and borrowers of many ages. One thing I noticed though was that, even though the staff is greatly dedicated, there not many qualified librarians here.  The indexing, classification of books and arrangement according to genre, author, was in wanting. Some help from  visitors who can assist  the Library Management in this area can be helpful. This public Library is one of the famous one and had a lots of Books.This was burnt down during the unrest and later restructured with the same old style. Worth popping into see after or before going to Jaffna Fort - if only to see the extent of the post war restoration work. Peaceful and cool. It had become an attraction for tourists only due to its past destruction during the conflict. Even I went to see the place to see it's majesty look and books it is enriched with. But disappointment as tourists are not allowed to go through the books Available in the library, even after buying a ticket to enter the library as a tourist. You could go and have a look at some pictures taken after the destruction and information about few missing journalists during the conflict. It will be a definite disappointment to tourists who are really eager to know about the books it has. But for a tourist looking for a architectural beauty of a building, got something to enjoy. This beautiful, huge public library was burnt down at one stage during the civil war. I was unable to visit inside but its exterior looks most impressive. It is a grand, working monument to peoples' education. Before destroyed by the LTTE this was the biggest libraries in south east asia, and now have reconstructed with the same architectural structure. Opened for public from 4pm to 6pm only. Not much to see inside other than a normal library. Important because of the historical value Famous Jaffna library. Fine old building and access for tge public to the library. Nothing much else to note. The library is nice to visit. You can have a quick look around but will have seen it in an hour. For us it was just nice to escape from the heat for a little while. The best think about it is the outside as it is a nice building. Impressive that despite decades of war, the people in the region prize learning, education, and preserving books. Although it was burnt down during the war, a lot of effort went into getting this place up and running again. Happy to see so many students using the library and checking out books. Cant say I loved it - but the story is quite interesting. Would step by for a few minutes as part of bigger Jaffna tour It was the biggest library in the Continent. During the conflict it was destroyed and it was a base for fight. Everybody has to contribute in the form of books to make it glory again Could only see from outside as visiting times are limited.  What we heard about makes it worth trying to get inside. This library was completely burned down by the LTTE during the war. A lot was lot in that fire and now it has been rebuilt. Open to the public: 4pm-6pm Entrance fee: Rs. 10/= The biggest library in Asia (at early 1980) which was burnt due to the conflict. The oldest building was renovated and handed over to the public recently. This library is located near to the general bus stand, closed to the Fort (dutch) and used by almost all the armed groups as a  base for their fight during the conflict time. In  any part of SriLanka library is not a tourist attraction other than Jaffna. This has a history This library was one of the best in Asia if not in the world. People of this area treat this as a place of worship (Temple, Church or Mosque). When this was burnt down every body cried and condemned. This is a new construction with new books but the old books and leaf records were destroyed . Still all Sri Lankans contributed in some way to redo the library. because of this back round this is visited by all visitors to Jaffna. This is the only place I have seen the visitors are not permitted with their footwear, there is a place to keep  your foot wear. There is no entry  fee but certain time restrictions are there I guess it is after 4 pm better you check before you go there. Apart from this this is a library. One of the sites to take in, when in Jaffna. Has been restored, the bright white building stands out on the sky line near the seaside. The library gardens are on quite a large block, and it is surrounded by parks and fields, and lake, so it is good to take a peaceful walk around, just outside the city centre. Bring a bit of food for the resident dog (he's shown on dog-star charity). Their health could certainly use it to stave off the mites. The children's park is just across the road, and the courts building a further block away. It is also easy to visit the library, and then walk a short distance, past the pillar, stadium, and around to the old fort. A good walk with sea breeze.",3.7,216,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1c/86/bb/04/jaffna-public-library.jpg?w=700&h=400&s=1,0.0,25.66844919786097,13.903743315508022,2.13903743315508,20.32085561497326,37.96791443850268
Kabaragala Mountain,"Kabaragala Mountain. A fascinating place that's within a day's effort. The scenary from atop on a clear day is the reason for it being high on the list of dedicated hikers. An easy climb once you're through the tea Estate and the panorama would compel an hour's stay. Be watchful walking the path along the ridge as some parts are very much on the edge of the steep precipice. Leech activity is to be expected. Be careful climbing up/down the thickly covered savannah in the incline as you would not see where you are about to put your feet. Take time climbing due to this issue. Please bring back all that you take and help bring back what's left by the irresponsible and ignorant. Get the bus to Dolosbage from Gampola and ask the conductor to drop you by the aptly named Craighead Estate, giving indications of the intrepid pioneers from Scotland who opened up much of our tea country.Find your way through the excellently well maintained tea estate and the through the village.And no you do not need a guide. Few folks who you might along the way is all you need to find the foothill of the steep incline through the savanah all the way up until l the view point .Time to the top is under 2 hours even by a senior citizen. Yes the trek is ok for a senior.Watch out for few leeches during the wet season though. View from the top is GOOD in the highest sense. Take extra care if you feel like walking up to the highest point since some parts of the path is bit too close to the precipice. And the view from the very top is second  to what you get to see at the first view point so you might as well decide to not try the summit.. BRING EVERYTHING BACK.INCLUDING THE WHAT'S LEFT BY THE IDIOTS .PLEASE. Kabaragala, at 1506 metres is a nice and easy climb which could be covered within one day with hours to spare. The hike takes one along various types of terrain,right through a mountain village and finally up a savanna type grassy slope to the first view point for breath taking views of the valley below. A journey along the ridge from the first view point would take the traveler to the summit. Public Transport to the foothills is available from both Gampola and Nawalapitiya. The first view point of the mountain could be reached within just 2 hours after starting the climb. Path is clear till the edge of the village and from then onward its savanna with the trees at the top of the hill  clearly visible .Road to Craighead, at the start of the trail is in good condition .Expect a degree of leech activity during the rainy season.",5.0,4,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2a/75/5d/a0/caption.jpg?w=700&h=-1&s=1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,66.66666666666666,33.33333333333333
Kala Wewa,"Kala Wewa. We passed by this huge reservoir en route to the Akuvana Buddha. It holds more than 120 million cubic liters of water. It supplies Anuradhapura, 20 miles away, with its water. It dates from the 5th c AD.",4.5,2,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/ae/90/23/kala-wewa.jpg?w=700&h=400&s=1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,100.0
Kallady Beach,"Kallady Beach. The beach conveys atmosphere of the past with a look to the future. To the images of fatigue of fishermen engaged relentlessly in daily work you see young couples walking on the beautiful endless beach. Everyone responds with smiles and nods to your greeting in harmony with the quiet undertow of the ocean. Time flows under a centuries-old tree that refreshes you courteously from the tropical heat. You leave everything behind you, you only look forward, with serenity. Here's a single dump. Plastic and cans everywhere. It's hard to believe but so you can ruin beauty from The beach itself was lovely and well-maintained. Nevertheless, the rough sea made it challenging to fully enjoy a swim, especially with the uneven sea bed causing further difficulty. For a solitaire who just needs nothing stands around him and the ocean, there's no better option .Take a walk along the beach towards the promontory and the memory would last a lifetime.. Nice place to see another peaceful beach in Batticaloa . Pls go on any day than Sunday if you are a peaceful person. if you like crowd,,,make sure to be there on Sundays Take your walk from the center of town ,towards the clock tower, then turn right and walk along the old iron bridge .Once you have passed the bridge for about few hundred feet, turn left near Saravana Bhawan [a restaurant] and walk straight on, for another few hundred feet. Trust me this long walk will add to the feel you are searching for. Once you reach the beach the first feeling might be somewhat underwhelming , but this first impression is not the reality. Walk to your left along the paved road for about 1km and you would find the bliss .Think of a moment and place where its just you, sea and no one else around. You will find it here. Keep on walking till the edge of promontory if you have time. This is beyond Kallady beach but who cares. Nawalady beach is for those who want the whole vista for themselves. Serendipity. Apart from diving and sea bathing area offers a few things.  The beach was very beautiful. A bit lonely. A handful of tourists can be seen relaxing. Some tourists and the dive center arranged clean ups.  The people in the area need to be aware of the pollution. The floods rain too bring rubbish to the beach. Authorities need to focus the attention to keep the beaches clean. One more thing I noticed. The large village nets so called MAA Dal is being used. They do not get enough harvest for the efforts. People are very friendly All in all if you need to relax this is the place. I would not recommend this beach for swimming. The waves are big (at least when I was there in February) and there are signs advising against going in the water. Also, I did not feel comfortable being in a bikini on the beach since everyone else is fully dressed. Nice place for a walk though. Wonderful place to Relax Most Evening I spent my free time here with local community people very friendly, helpful and Safe please 100% natural eco, very clean beach and your can see Tsunami memories. No any other place to replace this zone Very calm and tranquil place. One of the cleanest beaches I have seen in Sri Lanka. Beach spans across a vast area and yet its hard to spot any garbage lying around. Not suitable for bathing. Best visit in evenings or early mornings. Good place to witness sunrise. I don't know if it's just the part of the beach that we visitied at the Northern (Kallady Bridge) end, but I was disappointed. The approach is through a sea of rubbish: though the beach itself is clean near the sea, there are plastic bottles strewn over the sand. There was nowhere obvious for something to eat or drink. But the sea was gorgeous and warm and the sand gorgeous Very beautiful beach in Eastern province Sri Lanka. Just 2km from Batticaloa town. Very relaxing place to spend an evening with your family. 'Cherish' is the song which hums in when the solitary walk is taken when the sun is in the western sky. Entire beach is almost deserted ,save for a couple of tourists and few fisherman .This isthmus which is home to the Kallady beach is sparsely populated all the way to the promontory .Story has it that this picturesque beach once housed a tiny colony of Srilankans -all direct descendants of the Portuguese  Virtually the entire community perished in the morning of Tsunami .The memorial to them add to the sentimentality of the evening when the sun is about and hour to set. Kallady is among the most romantic beaches of Srilanka .Its clean and safe . Cool and the Gang never came to Kallady .Not sure about the guy who wrote the song however. If you are a beach lover, this place is perfect for you. The beach is almost empty and a great place to relax. In the morning you can watch the fishermen go out to the sea. The beach is much smaller than it was due to erosion.  But still a great hang out place for a pleasant evening. Never miss the sunrise enjoying from this beach. You can see the fishing boats returning form the sea & busy fishermen. The beach is big enough to have children's activities. A must visit place in Batticaloa. Beautiful huge clean beach. Best time to go in the morning or evening to see the sunset. Very clean and well maintained. Waves are very rough and not recommended to take bath. Excellent place in batticaloa and we can go to this place via boat and vehicle also. My selection is boat. charges only for boat other all are free. When we go to the beach both sides lagoon and see. Nice experience with my friends i had It is a beautiful beach in the east cost of Sri Lanka. Nice place to spend your evening and enjoy the sunset. Nice ocean but the waves where very very strong today.... we could not go in. It looks abandon. Not a lot of people... Lets get one thing straight - I'm not a swimmer. The Kallady Beach is perfect for people like me who would go and soak up the sun, without heading too far out into the ocean. The Kallady Beach is virtually on the continental shelf. Venture six to ten feet out into the ocean here and the water gets very deep, very fast! For Suba Divers, Kallady Beach offers, by all reports, a couple of excellent wrecks to dive on, a fair distance from the beach itself. Not being much of a diver either, the reader should check this on Google! This is a few beach to spend time in Batticaloa.This is a average beach.This is a place here for you to spend the evenings. There is not much to do in Batticaloa and if you are here you are here to relax at the sea and this would your best bet. A long stretch of beach hat just seems to go on forever. I was here in February so not a tourist season, the sea was rough and you could just not think of getting into the water. And no crowds in February literally had the entire stretch of the sea to myself. your pretty standard Sri lankan beach, can get crowded at times, go around 4 or 5 when the sun goes down as it pretty unforgiving. We are a family with small kids (6 and 7). We went there in the afternoon 2 times and we also went into the water. There are waves and the kids need to use some swimming helpers as usual. The sand ist very find also in the water. You can go a bit away from the local beach area and there you are alone. The local area is unfortunately spoiled with some plastic litter like almost all places in Sri Lanka without extra cleaning people. But after you pass that it is beautiful. Bring your own food, water and shade if you need, as there is no touristic infrastructure. But that makes is special. Kallady beach is a one of the landmark of batticaloa.nice environment .every sunday evening large number of  people are gathering for enjoy their weekends. a long beach with few people. Fishing boats. Seaside temple, with another bearing the impact of the tsunami, being shifted & tilted. Many of seaside homes rebuilt. Went there on evening time.. It was nice.. Small kids were playing with kites on the sky.. Lots of families were sitting there and having a free and relaxed time on the beach...when night falls something starts to glowing on the beach.. Some say its small creatures..some say its some animal stuff..i don't know..but it was a nice experience..for my luck it was a full moon day..so i enjoyed my visit... I prefer the evening time to visit here... The beach is not clean at all now. The beach is very narrow comparatively to the other eastern beaches. The color of the sea is not that attractive. Probably because we went on a rainy day. This is an interesting place to see the locals out enjoying themselves.  After school the mothers bring their children down for an ice-cream or to enjoy themselves on the play equipment.  The older boys play volleyball or beach cricket, and the mothers watch the children or watch the waves.  Too dangerous to swim for me - and for the locals.  No one was in the water when we were there despite the heat.  Nice fishing boats, but pity the beach is so badly littered with rubbish. One of lovely beaches situated at batticalo . Children could enjoy much with sand play. Few were had sea bath. We were scared of bad whether forcast. Otherwise it is another lovely beaches in Sri Lanka and easy to travel from town This place is popular among the locals. Beautiful sandy beach but people are throwing garbage everywhere even though there are bins. There have been many incidents and deaths because of the high waves and circular currents. Be caution if you are not a good swimmer. Beach is really nice and have great views to the sea. You will also find fishing boats and fishemen there. Its a long beach and you can find places which are crowded and also very much isolated. Nice beach to relax at with the family and have a BBQ with close family and close relative at night. It's one of the virgin beach in Sri Lanka.Nice place to enjoy.It's clean and good surroundings.Week ends and full moon days local people visit here. Kalladyg beach frontage is a beautiful place to visit. Lot's of local visitors have thrown plastic bags and garbage all over the place. The municipality has to take action and keep the beach clean. Cows roaming around a pretty beach with a few tourist and a few locals and fisherman def worth a visit. There are really two parts to this beach. The first, the section adjacent to the access road and parking lot, is where most local people go. There's a dilapidated boardwalk linking several run-down wooden gazebos and, at one end, what used to be a children's playground; the odd bit of broken playground equipment is still there. All of this was constructed a few years after the tsunami, and has been neglected since. Further along, after the boardwalk, is the other, undeveloped part of the beach. Fewer people come here. Walk far enough (half a kilometer?) and you will end up at the tsunami-destroyed Kallady Thiruchchunther temple (it's amongst a grove of trees). The beach has a lot of litter. Part of this is swept in by the tides; you'll find soda bottles from Thailand and Malaysia, for example. Some of the trash is left behind by the fishermen who use the beach, and part by littering locals. There are few, if any trash bins to be found so please walk your trash out with you. However, if you can ignore the garbage, it's a lovely place that few people, tourist or local, go to. A word of warning: there are very strong rip tides at Kallady Beach, and people drown here every year. So unless you are a strong swimmer who knows what to do if caught in a rip tide, I recommend you stay out of the water. This is one of the many beached that tourists have not yet discovered.  Some local holiday makers have thrown plastic bags and garbage.  During the day time the beach and the surroundings look great.  Keep your vluables in the hotel.  Nice place for sea bathing. Nice place, good for all ages, relaxing and peace in mind place. Recommend for all to spend few minutes to relax and stress out your busy life, good for health (physically) and mind, good to go with family. All the best Like most beaches in Sri-Lanka this beach too is a nice place.Check up before swimming as sometimes the sea can be rough. Must make a visit if you happen to come to Batticaloa. Quiet beach with peaceful surroundings. You can watch fisherman return from the sea with their night's catch and even help them if you'd like. Best place to swim and work on your tan. Nice long stretch of empty beach was told it was quite safe to swim here but did not bother best to see it before the concrete blight takes hold. Though the site is so beautiful but no one taking care of cleaning up properly. Good place for diving, walk around especially at morning or evening hours. You can see the beauty of Batti, traditional way of fishing, and Eastern lagoon here. We were unlucky with the seasonal weather, which triggered abnormally high waves and dangerous swimming conditions. It may also have led to the very high volume of rubbish washed up on the beach. The beach area is unkempt and a lot of garbage lying around. But a beutiful beach.swimming is not advisable here. Very scenic. I stayed and dived at the deep sea resort and after noon was at leisure. I went for a walk and found this natural; beach.  Foreign investors and hotel owners have not yet found this virgin beach If you want a beach all to yourself look no further. But everything you need with you as all there is there is empty sand and sea A rather well kept secret this beautiful beach in Batticaloa ideal for a early morning stroll. Not very clean though as there were discarded bottles and plastic. Advisable not to go there after dark. best experience during sunrise. Was effected severely during the Tsunami. Village folks very friendly. In the weekend or on festivaldays it may be busy, but for the rest of the week you have kilometres of sand all alone for you.  When I visited, there was one guy with a tuk-tuk who was selling cool refreshments.  I didn’t see another café or restaurant. The beach was also cleaned before I arrived, so I had no problems walking barefoot on the sand. Nice beach you can enjoy if you go on a normal day.Unfortunately the day we visited it, there was a kite festival with a cultural show.Massive crowds with lot of vehicles. Managed to catch the beautiful scenery of a colorful evening sky with a calm sea. Please check  for any festivals or activities before visiting the beach,to avoid inconvenience. otherwise it is a nice beach to enjoy with family & friends. I visited this beach for a short period of time during evening. Really beautiful and nice place to stay. But be aware while walking on the sand, sometimes there are glass particles which can injure you. very big and no tourist beach, fishermen go out in the evening, nice to see the action, the bad part is that the beach is really dirty, a lot of broken glass, so beware your feet... Super beach, the beach was totally isolated, there was no one around. we were only there for a hour . We took a night train from Colombo arriving at 4am to Batti. we took tuk tuk to Kallady Beach and spent 2 hours until sunrise. was really beautyful experience! tuk tuk waited for us and than took us to Sunrise for awesome breakfast. tuktuk driver took 400rs and we were all happy I had the privilege of living in Batticaloa for 3 months, and I loved the Kallady beach. I would walk here from the Batticaloa city centre on some early mornings to watch the sunrise. It is usually empty and a great place to relax. As the morning progresses, watch the fishermen go out to sea and the local kids come out to play on the beach. Take a walk along the road parallel to the beach to see the destruction from the 2004 tsunami, and spend a quiet moment at the monuments erected to remember the victims from young and old. Do keep in mind that this is not a touristy area, and it's best that you are properly dressed to respect the local culture. Kallady beach is one of the most stunning beaches in sri lanka. The batticaloa beaches are generally more nicer than all the beaches in south and west sri lanka. Kallady beach is one of the nicest in Batticaloa District. Its said that it is dangerous for swimming. Thats not true! we were swimming every day and its not dangerous at all. Kallady beach is one of the beautiful beaches I have visited in east coast of Sri Lanka. Very scenic view with sea, beach and fishing boats. Little children play area is also present nearby and there are some ruins due to tsunami of 2005 too. Must visit place while at Batticaloa.",3.9,76,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/09/37/6f/13/kallady-beach.jpg?w=700&h=400&s=1,1.6666666666666667,23.33333333333333,13.333333333333334,3.333333333333333,16.666666666666664,41.66666666666667
Kalpitiya Kite Beach,"Kalpitiya Kite Beach. Beautiful place. Les crowded compared to other beaches in Sri Lanka. A great place for kite surfing, diving and dolphin watching tours.",4.0,1,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/22/17/17/06/caption.jpg?w=700&h=400&s=1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,100.0
Kalu Ganga Reservoir,"Kalu Ganga Reservoir. This is quite a new reservoir completed a few years ago. If you take a road trip down Rattota - Illukkumbura - Hettipola road you come across Bambarakiri ella, Riverston, Pitawala Pathana, Sera Ella, Thelgamu Oya and the newest addition is Kalu Ganga reservoir. It has scenic views and once we went there found out that there is one insta famous spot where you take a pic on seated on the middle of the road with a particular mountain as backdrop (not sure what it was, could be Lakegala). Once you pass the reservoir you can go all the way to Girandurukotte crossing the new bridge over Mahaweli river or you can go down to Hasalaka from Hettipola. Sadly the road from Raththota almost upto the reservoir offers a rather bumpy ride. The road is not terrible per se, but it's not a particularly comfortable ride either.....",5.0,1,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/0a/b4/35/a-new-reservoir-built.jpg?w=700&h=400&s=1,0.0,100.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Kalutara Bodhiya,"Kalutara Bodhiya. A good place to visit to understand local culture and beliefs. Photography is a must. Carry your camera aat all times. A really nice location by the river on the edge of a busy road. Large picturesque Stupa. Very quiet when we visited.  Small but really interesting frescoes of the life of Buddha. Take a nice tuk tuk journey to it. Would not make a special journey to visit it, a nice stop over. Made a brief visit to this Buddhist temple. It was very impressive, the local people were very accommodating. If you go to Sri Lanka it is a must, very nice temple and wonderful feeling and never seen so many Lotus Flower. If you seek relaxation and calmness to your mind, no other better place than this to do the job. Peaceful enviornment and will feel worldless emotions when you come out of this sacred place. Must visit place if you explore Kalutara area. I have visited Kaluthara Bodhiya many times, where I enjoy the religious rituals and Sri Lankan culture of Buddhist society. Great place for Buddhist photography. Part of the temple is facing the kaluthara river. and the other part is next to the rail track. You will get the best view from the north. You can reach there by train or road and very calming environment. Got to visit this place if you are in the area.  A must. Very educating, if you want to know about Buddhism. It is good to visit on Poya day (full moon) when many locals attend and the atmosphere is very good with most of the ladies wearing white. went into Kalutara Bodhiya a few times and although its a busy high street it was a little grubby and also be warned if you want to go to the fish market, take a peg with you, it STINKS!! also be aware a lot of begging and market traders trying to get you to look at their wares and goods, very pushy all the time, put your foot down and be firm and if anything you do like make sure you go into the actual stallholders stall, they will not hassle you. over all the high street not bad, however when you go to the bridges you can see the temples, these are beautiful and although unsure if you can go into the actual temple itself one side of the bridge allows tourists in, you will get a guide and again make sure if you tip them, give them what you think you need to and be firm, one of them tried getting to greedy, I had to tell him in tell him in the end where to go, that's not me but this is what you need to do, I gave £1,000 rupees this was plenty and works out just under £5.00... dont let this put you off, it is really nice in there and a lot of respect for the Buddhists This was an amazing experience. It was like being in the whispering gallery with a gallery of paintings all around. Such a wonderful experience and a joy to visit. Please be respectful when visiting Visited the temple with a friend from Sri Lanka, I found it a very moving and spiritual experience. A very beautiful place.  There is no entrance fee to the temple but you can make a donation. If you are visiting Kalutra this is a must on you list of places to visit. One of the best little temples we saw in Sri Lanka , well maintained and we were able to take all the beauty of it. Well worth a visit As everybody knows Kaluthara Temple is one of the highlight and secret Buddhist temple in Srilanka. easy stop and worth visit for anyone passing Colombo - Galle (A2) road It is situated on the galle road at Kalutara town.the best time to visit this temple is after 6.00 p.m. the Bo tree is very powerful. If you go and make a wish, 100 % your wish will come true. Specially if you are wishing some body to have good health while he/she is sick, this place will help you. This place was a really nice stop. The buildings  were simple yet beautiful I recommend this place if you have some time. This one is more different than all other stupa's. This one is pure And not seen by lot of tourist. There are several Boeddha statues. Also THE area arround this place is nice u Can see THE beach view from upstairs. Worth a visit - but don't get caught into paying for a guild through the temple, its free. They may ask you to donate for milk money for the babies however they then ask for 1700 Rupees !!!! Not really a lot of money but its how its done. Nice and peaceful place to be, nothing special about this place. Can visit en route while going to other places WE have visited Kalutara Bodhiya On the way to Bentota Beach Hotel when our daughter, son in Law and granddaughter visited to Sri Lanka from Melbourne Australia  in June 2016. Kalutara Bodhiya situated in Kalutara at a side of the Galle Road. Those days there was a big Bannion tree (nuga Tree) at the entrance of Kalutara all the vehicles had to go under the Banion tree. Some time back the tree was broken down due to weather and now there is no sign of the tree. All most all the vehicles pass near the Kalutara Bodhiya donate some money to the Bodhiya and also conductors of the public transport collect money from the people who like to donate  and put the collected money in the till which is constructed on the wall of the Bodhiya. Kalutara Bodhiya is an old Bodhi tree which is identified as one of the 32 saplings of Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi which was planted during the reign of King Devanampiyatissa in the 2nd century BC at Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka. Now there is a viharaya built opposite to the Bodhiya. In side the viharaya there are statues of the lord Buddha.Every day lots of people visited the Bodhiya and the Viharaya. During Full moon days the Bodhiya and Viharaya full of people who observed sil.This is one of the attractions in Kalutara and travelers who are going down South should stop there and visit the viharasya which is opposite to the Bodhiya. The environment in the Bodhiya is calm & serene, as you settle down on the floor, transcending time & space, looking inward for a brief time, leaving the cares of the world. With a fantastic view of the Ocean, the place is divine. As a part of my sons school trip we visited this place. Kaluthara Temple is located at both side of the road. It’s around 1.5 hrs from Colombo. The Upper Bodhiya is a sprout from the Sri Maha Bodhiya at Anuradhapura. This temple is believed to be belongs to the 2nd century One is typically dropped off at the other side of the road where a guide is picking up the tourists and shows you this part with the ancient (and beautifull) tree. The guide asked us (quite directive...) to donate 10 usd per person as a donation to the poor. Interesting to see the official desk for donations at the entrance of the temple on the other side of the road. In hindsight we would have preferred to give our donation here. Its a place for Buddhist to worship and pray, when you go there its essential to wear long cloths white or pale colored.no head ware allowed. peaceful place to relax and calm the soul down. We visited this lovely religious place during our stay in Kadutara & it was a very nice experience go to inside of a Stupa! Kalutara bodhisattva is one of the main Buddhist attractions and a religious destination in Sri Lanka and the history behind this stupa will take you to many centuries. Fascinating to see all the worshippers, and to walk around between two temples barefoot.  Lots of lights and flashing neon, and streets decorated with flags. When you enter, you are told to take off your shoes. If you are a woman without any cover for your legs, you are given a stinky cloth. Inside, nothing too interesting. Just a lot of candles burning and pigeon poo. I got attacked by one of the pigeons. Inside the dome, it's quite scary. Quite a lot of wasted space really. People walking around in circles for ages and playing drums with others watching. This temple is so famous in kalutara. Me and my Family went here to see the beauty and to worship the temple. The temple is  old and big. One of the most recognized places in Kalutara specifically among buddhists. Situated either side of the Colombo Galle main road. Has a scenic view adding to it’s religious importance. One of the rare places where you find a ‘chithya’ inside another and you can walk inside it has to walk about 50 m from the car park to bodiya. nice view from the temple. kalu ganga can see widely. I am Christian  but hotel  arranged  me city  tour to Bodhiya temple..The was very clean and neat. People  over  there are more  helpful for the foreigners.. This is the best place to visit when we are in problem. The environment in the Bodhiya help to relax our mind and take the good decision after thinking with peaceful mind. Buy you flowers from the vendor outside and make a wish inside . Climb the stairs and at the top is a huge circular domed room with paintings depicting the birth of Buddhism . My knowledge of the religion was limited so enjoyed it . I biked from the nearby Anantara , dual carriageway with tuk tuks lorries buses and cars weaving about made it an interesting experience too ! 😀 This temple has two sections, one either side of a busy road, but is connected by subway. The first section requires a donation and you are accompanied by a guide. The guide was very informative. We were accompanied by our rickshaw driver for the second section and he explained much about the temple and the pictures of Buddha and the stories. I learnt more about Buddhism in 30 minutes in this temple than I had learnt in my life before. Thoroughly recommend. Buddhist temple, looks nice and interesting from outside. The entrance is free, but you have few people standing around waiting for tourist to show them place for tips. ( I know they want to make them living, but if you would tip everywhere even on free public places you wont have much money left) The colours of Buddha are very nice and paintings too. Be prepared to take of your shoes of before you enter in to the temple and make sure that your body its coved with clothes especially women's. There is holy water outside of temple on the side of the road for drivers to stop and have a little blessing for them journey on the road. Cross the road is market with flowers where you can buy them and bring them inside to temple. watch out for the fake guides- you dont need a guide... its pretty striaght forwards but remember to remove your shoes I really enjoyed visiting this place. It was very spiritual. I know very little about Buddhism but tried to learn during my visit to Sri Lanka. From what I could gather, there is the stupa one one side of the road, which you can go inside as it is so large and hollow, and the other, older Buddhist temple or viharaya on the other side. Of course there is also the Bo tree. There is a lot of history and culture here, so make sure you see it all. Don't just visit the stupa, even though it's architecture alone is amazing. Soak up the culture, look around, listen to the locals who have come to worship here. You'll take more away from the experience that way. we had travelled past Kalutara Bodhiya and thought it beautiful but felt abit self concious going in on our own...we really shouldn't have worried a lovely gentleman showed us around and took extra care to explain his belies and the amazing temple to our daughter. he helped her light and oil lamp and even gave her flowers for her hair. our daughter took it all very seriously and everyone was lovely with us all.yes we were expected to tip on our leaving, but after all the time taken with us it was really a pleasure giving to help this incredible place . it is a bhuddist temple. If you want to visit the temple u should wear a dress below knee lenght. otherwise u will not b allowed to go inside . Who ever goes to this place despite of religion will fall in love as it's absolutely a best location. The Kalu river and the beach lagoon and the railway and mail road from all this place get the amazing view that you can get pleasurable scenery. Very interesting. If you are a Buddhist this place is a must go. Even if you aren't there is a lot to see and experience about Buddhism and Sri Lankan culture over there. very clam and quite place.also very secret place.people believe it has power . Very secret place for buddhist This place is one of the most important places in sri lanka and to the Buddhist culture. Lots of things to see, and learn,  in here you have a rear chance of walking in to a giant pagoda. An Amazing Place, Highly Recommend This temple was beautiful and very busy because we were there during the school holidays. We then visited the small museum next to it which has interesting artefacts and a coin collection with coins from different countries. Well the temple I saw many times when went tuk-tuk. Near temple is located flower market. By the way opposite bus station was my favorite tea shop. They have different high quality tea: black tea, orange pekoe, green tea, fruit tea, herbal Free entry but you are expected to make a donation to the shoe lady who looks after your shoes etc You don't need guide or anything, we got the local bus from kalutara to here A place of visit of all Buddhists. One of the many places Sri Lankan Buddhists stop by/visit who are traveling on the Galle-Colombo main road. Dont pay for entrance,. give a donation into the box or for the official office for placing shoes. Very nice, very calming. excellent views - can see all the way up the river to Adams Peak. Kalutara is the place where I was born.  So much has changed since -  from the increased traffic to the noise and the pollution - turning the small, peaceful town of Kalutara once was, where I grew up, into a chaotic, restless place. There is a highway runs across the town, making it easier for the drivers to get from place to place , quicker than it used to be. Amid the hustle and the bustle, Buddhists never failed to stop by the Kalutara Bodhi.  The old temple I love to this day. This is the only place I miss since I moved out of Kalutara and  I never fail to visit the temple since. They have made a few changes, yet, the old Bo tree, (a sacred tree) and the old shrine room where there is a very old statue of Buddha, remained just as beautiful as they were many moons ago. This is due to the constant care given by the Buddhist society, in Kalutara.  You feel the power of the Blessings as soon as you step into the temple.  There is also another very big statue of Buddha on the other end of the temple.  Unlike those days, you do not have to risk your life trying to cross the main road to get to the other side of the road, where there is a branch of this ancient temple, that is built on a hire hill. There is a subway to cross the main street. These temples are situated by the famous Kalu river (meaning -black river in Sinhalese), where I used to bath with my Papa, when I was a little girl.  I absolutely adore this place.  I would also like to add, if you are lucky, you might see elephants on the roads, with their carers of course. Hearing the recent news of a man being attacked by an elephant in another country, this is something I always say to people who visit Sri Lanka. Wherever you go, if you see an elephant, do not  run up to it and start taking photographs, flashing the camera light in his eyes.  This disturbs the elephant.  Many years ago, someone dropped a cigarette end in front of the path of the elephants during the main procession in Kandy.  When the elephant stepped on it, he got disturbed.  That day, the elephants ran a riot and killed many people.  Elephants are adorable to look at, they are very important part in our lives, but when you visit these places, respect these animals and the religious places you visit.  You have to remove your shoes and dress appropriately.  Well, I hope many people would visit Kalutara and enjoy the sheer beauty of the nature.  Calico is another place to visit in Kalutara.  Be very careful when you visit this places.  If you go to the near by hotel for a cup of tea, you could see the Kalutara Bodhi from the distance and also, you can stand on the rocks, by the Calico.  I stress, be very careful, because water crazily swirls round the rocks. The photo of the Bodhiya is the temple on the hill, on the other side of the road.  Inside is hollow and massive.  It is decorated with stories of Buddha's life.  There are also statues of Buddha inside.  Takes about half an hour, if you care to read all the information and look at the beautiful paintings on the walls.  I have been there many times in my life time and I will be going again in February 2016.   This is why I selected this date from the drop down list. Got five tuk tuks into kalutara as a trip to town went temple and was fascinated by the architectural parts of it was clean and very welcoming then into the shop part can haggle get good bargains if need This is an iconic Stupa, we all pass along the Galle Road heading south. But it is when you go in, that you discover the amazing fact that you can virtually walk inside the Stupa. The echoes bouncing back from walls will continue to echo through your soul. A must visit after worshiping Kalutara Bodhi. Interesting and clean bigger than it looks this is still in use and local people are always there praying The bodhiya was build to pay respect to the holy bo tree on the opposite side of the road. It is a unique experience to visit especially in the evening, when it's filled with locals praying and bringing their donations and sacrifices to the Buddha. This is the only bodhiya where you can actually go inside the dome on the top. If you go at daytime, you'll be rewarded by wonderful views of the surroundings. Make sure you visit the garden around the holy tree across the street (use the ""sub way"") Went there twice. First time, on a full moon night. Got to experience something very local which was absolutely amazing. Must to inside the temple too. Also walk around the bridge, see the train passing. People are so friendly here. ""Kaluthara Bodhiya and Dagaba"" is one of the main attractions of people going through the Galle Road. It is situated in the Kalutara District and is one of the main Buddhist shrines in Sri Lanka. The specialty of the Dabada is that, people can go in to the outer Dagaba and there is another small dagaba inside the large one. we were at there,memorable places in our vacation . lot of tourists will visit this important  place. Kaluthara bodiya is located in a very nice area beside the Kalu Ganga.it was the 4th highist river in sri lanka. One of the gretest temple in recently build very famous among travellers.locals who travells south put donation to get blessings.beauty because of it's massive Stupa and Old Bo tree.Stupa is great because can climb inside.inside can fide lot's of paintings belong to story of Budda. We visited the Kalutara Bodhiya during our stay in Kalutara and were truly moved by its peaceful and spiritual atmosphere. This sacred Buddhist temple is built around one of the 32 saplings of the original Sri Maha Bodhi tree in Anuradhapura, making it a very important site for local worshippers. The white stupa (dagoba) is unique because you can actually walk inside it, which is quite rare in Buddhist temples. Inside, there are beautiful murals and statues depicting the life of the Buddha. The entire area is clean, well-maintained, and offers a calm, respectful environment. Located right by the Kalu Ganga (river), the setting is very picturesque especially at sunset. It’s a great place to reflect, take in some history, or simply enjoy the peaceful surroundings. We also appreciated that it wasn’t overcrowded when we went in the late afternoon. This  Buddhist temple is  a world reknown place, it has a lovely Bo tree(sacred tree) & a beautiful Stupa where Buddhists love to worship  . The temple is situated on the  Galle Rd in Kalutara. Loved it 😁 Great way to see budist temple. It's located on the banks of Kalutara river. So peaceful and so much to learn about the budism. Every one in our family enjoyed. Definitely one place to visit if you are going down south. It is much crowded during poya days and Sundays. So if you want to relax your mind and go for peace of mind, avoid those days. Parking is available a bit far off the bridge. Great monument to visit. Amazing combination of sea, river, green Boo tree and White pagoda. One of the must place to visit when you are at Kalutara and you can climb the large Pagoda and you will find real serenity inside the amazing Pagoda. Kalutara Bodhiya is located centrally right where the bridge is starting at Kalutara South End. Spread across both side of the road, this is a spiritual Buddhist temple. Main prayer hall is a majestic circular hall and a definite visit in Kalutara. However, travellers beware that this is the only place in my entire Sri Lanka trip where people tried to scam and never expected the same inside Buddhist temple. On entry, one person offered to explain the place as a tour guide. In the end of the visit, he introduced to one person and saying that tomorrow is full moon and there will be prayer and offering at the temple, asked for USD  5 to give. I offered him LKR 100 sensing something amiss and this was a scam as the 2nd person was a complete outsider in connivance with the tour guide. At the end of the tour, the guide himself was asking for money and again the kiosk which was keeping shoes asking for money. I am ok offering money to the persons keeping shoes and also the guide explaining but the guide himself will scam in a Buddhist temple in the name of offering to God in full moon day is really bad!! Please note donation is accepted in all temples but always put the same in donation box and not to anyone directly. This is the main Buddhist hub of Kalutara with 2 ""BO"" Trees . Calm  , peacefull spiritual relaxing religious place for who loves to visit. Please dress white dress with full covered your body. Nice place to spend a few hours very active and a lot of devotees very famous place. nicely located by the side of the river This is a place one can easily accessible located around 40 km from Colombo. This is a wonderful scenic location blessed by the famous bodhi tree which is one of 32 saplings of Sri Maha Bodhi. We arrived here the weekend following a full moon, and the queues to go and see the relic were tremendous - hundreds and thousands of Buddhists, all dressed in white and carrying lotus blossoms and lilies. This is the only temple in which you can go inside the dome. Walking around the inside, you can walk round the 75 pictures depicting various scenes important to Buddhism. On the other side of the road (best to use the subway), one of the ladies there gave me an incense stick to burn, another provided me with incense oil. It was beautiful to take part in these rituals. The local people were very kind and explained what was going on. Definitely a must-do if you stop in this town. Visited the Bodhiya on Christmas day. It was a festive place where there was a lot of worshippers giving thanks and prayers to the Buddha in the Bodhiya temple. Poya is the full moon holiday that occurs every month. The Bodiya is the only dome temple that allows entry and people come from far and wide. Beware the guides solicit donations for a food drive and to be fair there is a donations office along with a shoe store for foreigners footwear. Well worthwhile and rewarding In keeping with the Buddhist culture. Beautiful to look at and pilgrims who had come to worship added to the special place tourists were admiring. The oil lamps and offerings of flowers at the temple provided a very Eastern atmosphere. Architecturally pleasing and somewhere which is well worth seeing and part of the land. Large monolithic buildings like these really attract me and the open space provided the perfect space for the devoted. This special pagoda is unique compared to any others in the world and most respected one for Buddhist.   Located in between the Indian ocean and the One of the main river (Kalu) in Srilanka. Nice and calm place for meditation and longest walking path for meditation also available. Kalutara Bodhiya is a Bodhi tree located in kalutara western province of sri lanka. Kalutara bodhi can be considered as a famous place among all the tourists attractions. very Calming and peaceful place (Buddhist religious Place),No entrance fee, you can freely visit and worship its very beautiful and one of the very ancient and important buddhist pagoda to visit. ancient paintings to see. i recommended you to visit on the way to down south We were in May 2015 there , there was a big Festival with a lot of light and flowers ! Nice experience. Its a buddhist temple.Well it was a different experience.The place is peaceful and you cannot wear cap and shoes inside. If you have thirty minutes or an hour to spend in Kalutara, go to the temple! Dress well: knees and shoulders covered. Sit at the Bodhi tree and watch the locals preform their rituals. The main stupa also has additional information on the life of lord Buddha. Just watch out for swindlers. We had a really nice visit here which was the main reason for us visiting Kalutara.  We arrived for evening puja and enjoyed wandering around the site, under the subway and inside the dagoba.  The birds roosting at dusk were very memorable. Peaceful but huge. The big temple has an ancient bodi tree and a stupa dome that you can enter. Inside there is a smaller stupa and artwork showing the life and teaching of Budda. This is situated at the entrance of the city of Kalutara which is about 35 KM from Colombo there are ample public transport from Colombo Bus will more easier it will not cost even $ .50 cents. This teple is standing just by the side of the Colombo Galle road. This place is worshiped  by all Buddhist people.  All  are permitted to can go in to the temple. On one side you have the Bo tree and the temple other side the temple and the Tagoba (The big white dome), a specialty here is that you can go into the Tagoba. Please note there is no entry fees or donations to any one if you want you can put it into the box or the temple office(don't give to any individual) . There is a place for you to leave your foot wear so don't go to shops and kiosk and be cheated.  In my view you don't need a tour guide to this site you can manage by your self there is a beautiful river by the side of the temple and a beach close by. There is a tunnel crossing you can use to cross the busy road. Please be decently dressed no shorts and mini skirts are allowed. Definitely worth a visit as this is a rare opportunity to go inside a stoupa. There is a stoupa inside the stoupa, and a series of paintings which tell the story of Buddha, The Stoupa is part of a larger temple site which is well attended by locals. So many people come for kalutara bodiya. kalutara river is by the side of bodiya. There is small tunnel to cross the road. This is very useful for pilgrims. The big stupa is other side of the road. We were there at national day, so there were many people and we were the only tourists. But everyone was very friendly and we got a good insight into the culture. Definitely worth a visit! It's  one of the  great  places in  Kalutara. Beautiful  location  on the  river, bridge make it  looks  nice during the day  and  at night. Close to the  temple  bus stop. I  recommend to visit. Visited while staying at Kalutara. Car park is further than expected. Temple was less crowded since it was a weekday. The underground tunnel is a safe way to cross to the other side of the temple. Worth a look if you are Kalutara as it is one of the few things to do in the centre as a tourist. As in all Buddhist temples visitors must remove their shoes and there is a lady who looks after your shoes whilst you visit. There is a ""discretionary"" donation for entry and for looking after your shoes. The ground was quite rough so wasn't the easiest to walk on if like us you don't walk barefoot outside very often. Inside there are four Buddha statues to view which aren't particularly ornate. A best view of Indian Ocean and Kalu River. If you are lucky enough you will see the start point of the river (Sri Pada Mountain) when the sky is so clear.So this is a place you can see both the start point and end point of a river.A very sacred buddhist temple so it is better to speak softly and wear light colour full cloths We were allowed in this temple that signposted no guides no fee. The uniqueness of the place is the done that is hollow and can be entered. A good place to ponder Visited this lovely building and certainly well worth a visit. We both found that it was quite an emotional experience seeing the eternal flame for victims of the tsunami. The building is free to enter but you will be expected to make a small donation (20 rupees) to look after your shoes during your visit. Don't be fooled by 'touts' who unfortunately will show you around but then demand up to 2000 rupees per person. This money doesn't go to the temple it goes straight into their pockets. All in all it was a very good experience and we are glad we visited A nice religious place with a lovely surrounding. The architecture is superb. I really loved the scent of the fragrance sticks :D An interesting insight to the Bhuddist faith. The stupor is hollow. Ask a local to tell you what is happening. The people are very friendly and helpful One of the iconic Buddhist temple located at Kalutara (next to galle road). This temple is famous for the Bo tree located in it and pictures at the inside of the sthuppa. Extraordinary temple with a vast stupa. I found the Buddhist teaching from our guide in the area across the road from the temple a little more interesting than the slightly antiseptic interior of the temple itself, although the illustrations of the life of Buddha were fascinating The Kalatura Bodhi is the Buddhist temple where people gather to worship. The sacred Bo Tree is one of the main attractions. Very helpful guide explained abut the religion.  Spent an hour looking around the temple.  Worth a visit. Not very far from the Hotel with Tuk Tuk !! Only Rupies 300 one way to the City Kalutara. One can also reach this town with Train from Turyaa Kalutara Hotel. The majority of Sri Lankans (82%) are Buddhist and every where you go you come across great Buddhist temples. This is a must for any traveller who wishes to experience the rich teachings of Lord Buddha Great place to visit. Very old bo-tree with a giant sthupa. Almost everyone stop at this place if traveling to down south via Galle road. Ample parking is available. Need about 1/2 - 45 mnts to explore the place. You can't miss the Kalutara Bodiya (Dagoba) if you are driving on the normal Colombo to Galle route, it's a magnificent Buddhist temple where millions of people venerate every year, the evening light ceremony is the best time to view it, it is one unique Dagoba where one can enter in to the belly of the Dagoba which is very rare in other temples, the Bo tree on the opposite side with a golden fence is a highly religious place where people go to engage in pooja, must stop if you pass by here.. Rohan Jayamanna Probably better to see the Kalutara Bodhiya as part of seeing other sights unless you plan to meditate for a while or just sit and and enjoy the peace. Only saw this temple from the road. Very impressive and very popular. Many people stop to pray outside the temple. Very nice temple, makes a nice photo opportunity. Very clean and well maintained. Lots of locals both inside and outside praying and many people selling flowers for you to take in. Very peaceful place. I thought this place was hundreds of years old. The drawings on the ceiling are stunning. Well worth a visit so quiet inside and well looked after. Put donations in the yellow bins or take into the office and they will give a receipt. I went early evening to pray, it was absolutely stunning and serene even though it was quite busy with others praying A great temple located close to river sea and bridge. So beautiful view and so pleasant surrounding . Smell around is really nice. Recommend for all It is a Buddhist shrine located in the Kalutara District of the Western Province .It has an architecturally unique Dagaba. A beautiful and clean shrine where maintenance is well done.It is located near the Kalu Ganga. It consists of two sections on either side of the road and is connected by a short underground tunnel.With a peaceful environment and historical value, this shrine is a must visit place for tourists. a new temple not interesting at all. very big but it was not interesting to visit it. people is very spiritual in Sri Lanka...this is interesting... In busy down town. First Buddhist tmple. Not the prettiest by far thiugh. There are many more beautidul ones to see. You can not miss it, if you are travelling from Colombo to Galle. It is huge structure painted in white. We could not go inside because of the space between the place for taking off the shoes and the temple entrance is having beach-like sand. So we could not take off our shoes, as it was very hot.  It may be suggested that this gap is covered with titles or grass. Well worth a visit, its massive. Depending at what time of day you go it can be very, vey busy .Its nice to people watch there There is nothing wrong with looking at the temple like this it is just that if you seen two or three they all begin to look alike While you have to deal with the scorching floors barefoot, the serene silent and calming areas around this temple on both sides of a main road let you know what life is truly about. Spend time here to experience internal bliss and sites the soul will appreciate. Leave energized. Easy going calm 2hr vist.Temple easy to locate,no queues and followers eagerly willingly to share their beliefs. We negotiated 600 rupees from the hotel, 200 under the quoted rate, and lived to arrive at the temple, 6 km journey and 17 near death experiences. A friend of the driver took us in hand and showed us around the temple.  It was very informative but was spoilt when he asked for 5 dollars , 1000 rupees each.  The couple we were with stormed off leaving the temple, I paid 200 rupees, and took the subway under the main road to the largest  Step take (hollow dome) in the World. 34 paintings of Buddha's 3 journeys to Sri Lanka.   Well worth the trip. Worth a visit but wouldn't make a special journey.  The frieze in the Bodhiya detailing the life of the Buddha is interesting and the area where the stupa is situated has a number of beautiful shrines dedicated to various deities. You are required to cover your knees and shoulders so ensure you go prepared. You are also required to remove your shoes and some of the ground is quite rough. Visited this temple with a large stupa while staying in Kalutara. It's very nice and quiet place despite being on both sides of a busy road. This place is very beautiful & it belongs to Buddhist temple where you can study more on buddhism. Attracted by many religions The only Bhuddist Sutra (dome) that is hollow inside, well worth a look, incorporate it in a trip to the black river or to Bevis Bauers home This amazing place has an amazing story.... Chances are, if you are in any sort of Tourist Vehicle passing by, the driver will stop without being asked to, get out, put some money into a receptacle, and then get in and drive away again, leaving you wondering! Apparently, almost all drivers stop here at this Temple at the beginning of their journey down south, and put some money into one of the many boxes made for the purpose, as a sort of ""prayer"" for a safe journey! Seems to work, because very few people have complained that it didn't! Oh, and, it's a really good place to view a magnificient Buddhist Temple first-hand, ask your driver to allow you to spend some time inside, expecially in the evening when it's really beautiful! Kalutara bhodiya is a one of largest temple  in sri lanka. With a historical background and the beach sorrounding is beautiful. This is kalautara bodiya it's wonder of western Provence of sri lanka but its not a true one and only sri lanka ""bodiya "" you can reach in side the bodiya  amercing place near the Black river world one and only place you can see river starting place and mouth of the ocean One of famous Buddhist temples in Sri Lanka situated in Kalutara near River Kalu. One of specialty of this Sthupa is you can go inside of it. Our tok tok Driver took us  here for the day. He also came into the temple with us. You do have to cover your legs if you’ve got shorts on, but the lady at reception gave me a lovely white sarong to cover myself with, everybody in the temple is wearing white. It’s lovely to watch the locals going about their day and praying to Buddha. you can also then go underground to the other side where there’s the massive dome which you can go inside and walk around and there are paintings around the wall of buddha , well worth the visit. Was taken around by our tuk tuk driver tree full of fruit bats and Buddha life story in picture around inside of dome. Well worth a visit if in the area The Kalutara Bodhiya and the Stupa is located on either side of a busy road in Kalutara. The Stupa and the Bhodi Tree are an absolute must visit for any tourist. They are both located about 40 minutes out of Colombo, heading south at the mouth of the Kalu Ganga (river). The location itself is wonderfully picturesque. However the real treat is when you visit the actual Stupa as it is a white 3 storey high stupa that is uniquely hollow, allowing visitors to enter it, or even walk around the inside of it, or sit on the floor and just experience the peaceful atmosphere within. The larger stupa actually contains a smaller Stupa inside. The interior of the Stupa is decorated with paintings of the life of the Buddha. Then across the road from the Stupa is the Kalutara Bodhiya which is said to be another sapling grown from the original Bodhi Tree that is still living in Anuradhapura. Both these sites are very popular with all Sri Lankans. Therefore, you will find that both sites will be packed with devotees either just stopping-off before embarking on a long journey, or visiting for the day, or visiting and meditating perhaps for the day or even longer. When we visited, both sites were as usual very busy. The whole site had a very pleasant and peaceful energy. We observed many ladies at the Stupa praying or meditating around the site. We also entered the Stupa and walked around the inside, viewing all the paintings on the walls. While we were there, we observed a young man meditating and chanting Buddhist scriptures, in a very melodic tone, which seemed to reverberate around the whole Stupa. What a wonderful experience it was. Temple is located on the main expressway from Colombo to Galle. This can be your first stop point during the drive. How much time you spend matters on yourself. Beautiful Temple. Well worth a visit. Take flowers or buy them outside the temple. Free to visit, but donations gratefully accepted. I would normally rate this sort of thing higher as i love going around places of history, culture and religion however if i am honest it didnt grip me and say yes i would recommend everyone goes here. If you are in the area i would definitely have a wonder round. It is free to go in however you will be expected to make a donation if you ask for them to look after your shoes you may also end up with a guide showing you around and he most certainty will want a tip. Our guide wanted 2000 rupees each which i did find steep so we most certainly brought him down on this. It is beautiful to see the colours of Buddha and the paintings are brilliant. In the courtyard you can see the eternal flames burning for loved ones and can see the great tree. If you wonder under the road you can go into the main temple and walk around at your leisure it is very echoy so be careful not to speak to loud! Outside there are some fantastic views over the river so make sure you have your camera to hand. Iconic place of the Kalutara city also Kalutara district in Sri Lanka. This Buddhist place is maintain by Kalutara Bodhi Trust. It's first chairman was Sir Cyril De Soyza who founded this place. Special thing is the large and beautiful Dagoba can enter the inner side to view and worship who need to go there. Nice to see & experience the way of Buddhist shrines. The way of building is attractive. Great view with the river The kalutara bodiya is one of the religious place which is venerated by all buddhist in sri lanka. anybody who comes from colombo or galle stop over at the sacred shrine to pay their respects by way of worshipping and offerings. here is a hollow dagoba with interesting paintings. during 2nd century ad the ven. mahinda thera has directed that 32 saplings taken from the sri mahabodhiya be planted at certain points around the country it is believed that the present bo-tree in kalutara is supposed to be one of the 32 saplings of sri maha bodiya. the kalutara bodiya is located just after the kalutara river from the colombo side. A nice temple to visit but I wouldn't go out of your way to do so Once inside there isn't a huge amount to see Shoes must be removed before you climb the stairs but they can be safely stored Donations only required This is a beautiful temple. Be sure to climb up the stairs into the stupa (the large dome structure) and enjoy the views of the region. For an interesting little-known peaceful meditation place, cross the street into the other temple complex and find the building with a bodhi tree in a small courtyard. The building has a stone bench that surrounds the courtyard, and is a great place to meditate. Quite a large complex with underpass to reach main temple. Do not accept any offers from guides. Even though it's banned! We visited Kalutara Bodhiya during our trip to the south coast and it turned out to be one of the most peaceful stops of our journey. The temple is beautifully located by the Kalu River, and the huge white stupa looks amazing from the main road. What makes it special is that you can actually go inside the stupa and see lovely wall paintings that tell Buddhist stories. As a couple, we really enjoyed the calm and spiritual atmosphere it was a nice break from the beach and the traffic. We sat quietly for a few minutes just taking in the surroundings and watching locals bring flowers and offerings. dress modestly, remove your shoes before entering, and only give donations at the official box. There were a few people near the entrance offering “tours” for money, but it’s best to politely decline. We went around 4:30 pm, and the light was beautiful for photos, especially with the river and sunset in the background. Highly recommend a short visit if you’re passing through Kalutara peaceful, cultural, and a lovely shared moment for couples. One of the most secret Buddhist places in Sri Lanka and a must visit place if you are travelling in Sri Lanka. Situated glamorously on the shores by the Kalu Ganga the Kalutara Bodhiya is a Spectacular side and one of the most visited temples of Sri Lanka. Daily thousands of devoted Buddhist come to pay homage and get bless and to offer flowers, incent stick and light oil lamps to worship The Lord Buddha and the Stupa. Its on the way to down South of Sri Lanka and situated about an hour away from Colombo in the Galle in Kalutara. Most Buddhist visit the shrine on their way to down south , one important items is that it has an under ground leading to other side of the road. Kaluthara Bodiya is one of the best place to visit, mostly tourists will visit this holy place. Kaluthara bodiya is located in a very nice area beside the Kalu ganga (River) It is really claimed and cool religious place in Kalutara city. The Bo-tree has historical value too. You can see the nice view out there with Kalugaga river and the sea. Nice and Huge Temple in Kaluatara, Sri Lanka. Go and visit. Remove your shoes before enter. It was little bit crowded when we visit. The temple is an interesting building of Buddhist culture. You can get a little interesting insight into this culture. The entrance is for free, donations are welcome. Of course you should be respectful to Buddhist Religion and behave like it is suitable for a religious monument. Then you get a little feeling of the spirit of this place. The temple is well known in Sri Lanka and attracts many pilgrims and visitors. Located on the main Colombo/Galle Road it overlooks the Kalu Kanga River and is close to the centre of Kalutara A trip to Kalutara Bodhiya was an unforgettable experience. This temple is not only a religious site but also a cultural and historical monument. With Hai Srilanka Tours, I had the opportunity to observe beautiful Buddhist statues, paintings, and traditional buildings, while learning a great deal about the religious and historical significance of the place. Our guide, Sithum, explained everything to us in detail. No admission fee – free for all, though donations are welcome. Around 1–2 hours is the best to see and absorb the atmosphere.The temple atmosphere is serene and spiritual. You feel peace and positivity as soon as you enter.It is crowded during weekends, poya days (full moon), and religious festivals, but weekdays are quite emptier and peaceful.The staff and monks were friendly and courteous, politely guiding visitors on customs and prayers.This is the best place for anyone looking to experience Sri Lankan culture, Buddhism, and history. It is most appropriate for families, singles, and groups looking for an enrichment experience. Such a tranquil place in the town of Kalutara. One gets a sense of fulfilment when inside the temple. So serene and peaceful. There Bodhiya has two places on either side of the road and on the banks of the river. The inside of the place is huge with a white dome. Lovely place to pray in peace. A very interesting temple to pray and understand a bit more about Buddhism. Just avoid the solicitations. One of the most venerated place in sri Lanka .it is famous for its pagoda which is one of the uniqni creation in sri lanka .unlike other pagoda in the country it is hollow in side and painted with stories relating to the past lives of lord Buddha.they are very elegant paintings.its architecture is associated  with the world famous civil engineer Dr H N S Kulasinghe of pre fabricated concrete fame. Enough of parking before the Bodhiya when you visit from colombo side. But on a poya day this will be crowded. More valuable place for Buddhist people. ""Kalugana"" is beside the Bodhiya. Kalutara is the only church which you can go to Sri Lanka,We took the easiest to with tuk  -tukkal,he river of Sri Lanka's third largest river,the bus station tea is good for business Temple was crowded by pilgrims. But we were able to worship both side temples. The dagaba was unique. It was not made like other ones. It was not solid.  You can walk inside. Other side of the road you will find the famous Ananda Bodiya. Which is historically sacred place. People say Your wishes will come true if you worship this sacred place. Parking was situated off the bridge towards colombo side. You have to walk along the bridge. If you traveling towards south via Galle road when you passing this sacred place don’t forget to worship. It will make your trip successful. Almost crowded area..However calm sit and one of most popular Buddhist site..more crowded in poya days and weekends.. This is  one of the most beautifully painted temple's with the story of Buddha painted round the dome we have ever seen , definitely worth a visit. Clean and well maintained temple. Good place for meditation. View from the upper temple is extremely picturesque. This place is so nice and quiet. We spent there very nice time during some celebration. Monks are so kind. this budhist temple is near the bridge where one of largest river flows by. Amazing view from the temple and worth visit. As luck would have it we visited on the full moon festival so the temple was like a hive of activity. Plenty of lotus flowers sellers, incense sellers and lots of drums and noise. Very atmospheric. This Bodiya said to be one of 32 samplings obtained from Sacred Sri Maha Bodiya at Anuradapura (A sapling from Original Bodi Tree Lord Buddha stayed for cover when he became enlightened), during same time as it was planted. But what is more prominent is the giant Dagoba or Chaithya lately built close to it and some consider it to be the best recently built such structure in Sri Lanka, but crowded on many days with locals due to its proximity to Town, Colombo and Main Galle Road. If you are heading towards Galle using Old Galle Road (Not Southern Highway), better not to miss. Even clearly noticeable  from Road. At nice very clam and nice place. So beautiful in the evening . Buddhist secret place in kalutara... This is a popular  Buddhist temple in Srilanka. All the vehicles stop here while going past and the drivers pray for  a safe journey. Kalutara Bodhiya is a sacred temple for Buddhist and you can find many devotees every day. It is located just beside the Kalu Ganga (river). Walk on the bridge and get into the Temple. Temple has two sections either sides of the road and connected by a short underground tunnel. Make sure to visit both sides. ENTRANCE FREE Fantastic temple, made to feel very welcome and we were even asked to have our photo taken for the school children by their teacher. Really a must see. Buddhism is a very historical and important place for visit. Inside main temple you able to go inside and do any religious activities. If you need to get relaxed to your mind please go there and stay few hours Wonderful! We experienced the evening prayers. very welcoming. Visitors need to cover their legs before entering the temple. We enjoyed visiting this interesting temple - really interesting. It was very busy. As is often the case you need to be dressed appropriately - ladies are provided with shoulder covering. Shoes must be left at the entrance - not good for those with tender feet as there are many rough surfaces or stones This is on of the biggist budhiya temple on the Sri Lanka island. All the time so many local people come to this place and pray. When you go to any temple - you must to take your shoes off a cover knees a shoulders.When you do this, you are free to go into the temple. This temple is huge, really good for intention to detail. A guide came in with us which was very interesting! One of the most sacred buddhist temples in Sri Lanka. Surrounding is always peaceful. A must visit for a visitor. We had an amazing experience with Hai Sri Lanka Tours! Before starting our main tour, our guide Sithum and driver Dilan took us to a local hidden gem early in the morning. It was stunning and peaceful, with almost no crowd, making it a perfect start to our day. One of the highlights of our tour was visiting Kalutara Temple. The temple is incredibly beautiful and serene, with impressive architecture and a calm atmosphere that makes it perfect for reflection and photography. The surroundings are well-kept, and the temple offers a glimpse into Sri Lanka’s rich cultural and spiritual heritage. Highly recommend visiting if you want a peaceful and memorable experience. It is well worth stopping at the Kalutara Bodhiya if passing through. This historic temple and people from the area were instrumental in promoting the Buddhist revival during colonial times under the British. A place with a rich history dated as far as the arrival of Lord Buddha to Sri Lanka. Most sacred item was the Sacred Bo Tree. great country amazing things to see,good food ,lovely people,a must place to visit. great beaches ,to the tea plantations in the north. we stayed at the Avani spa and resolt in Katutara .The hotel is on a the beach and other side looks over a lagoon. The staff are so friendly and the food excellent. we stayed on a half board basis. I payed extra for a romantic meal for two on the beach and we were totally spoilt . We would really recommend this to any couples with a romantic side. Nice, but quite like any other temples. People are not very friendly, looking at tourists like troublemakers. A must stop and visit and donate money for its upkeep as it is genuine.A unique dago a as you can visit it’s inside which no other dagoba has. When you travel srilanka you must visit this temple at kalutara. this is a different kind of sthupa. you can go inside of the sthupa and sea arround the island. you can sea the beautiful kalutara beach from there. Clean place, busy with dedicated locals praying. You can buy flowers before you go in. People carry their lamp burning accessories/incense sticks. Cross the road via an underpass & you come to the main temple with its huge pagoda, visible from a distance. It is one of the few attractions in the area & was nice to visit. I believe this temple too has a lot of significance for Buddhists. Even when passing by, they bow their heads & many stop & drop a donation in the many boxes placed by the pavement. We travelled on a tuk-tuk from our hotel in Kalutara to the Bodhiya Temple. You enter on one side of the road. There is no entrance fee but you have to leave your footwear and it is expected that you give a small tip to the staff keeping your shoes safe. It is a good idea to wear an old pair of socks to protect your feet as you visit the site. There are a few small buildings, including one brightly coloured Buddha on this side of the road. Then you travel via a tunnel under the busy main road to the site of the main temple. You pass many flower sellers and have to climb a considerable number of steps before you can enter the main dome. Uniquely, this is not solid but hollow. When you reach the top level inside, you can survey 360 degrees of town, countryside and river through the windows which go round the inside of the dome. Above the windows are a large number of paintings of the Buddha, his life and travels. The atmosphere is enhanced by the throng of pilgrims and people praying. So many sights catch the eye. I was amazed how some quite aged and badly crippled worshippers bravely climbed the large number of steps to reach the prayer hall and the main dome. It is certainly a very worthwhile place to visit. As with most of Sri Lanka all the Buddhists respect and honour the shrine at Kalurara everyone stops and pays respect at the shrine just as we did a quite humbling experience the great place for buddhist people to worship. this is the biggest bodiya of kalutara. all the sri lankan people respect to this bodiya. Kaluthara Bodhiya is a Buddhist temple. The temple is located in a very beautiful location which opposite of the Kaluthara river. There you can enter to inside the pagoda. There you can see Ananda Bodhiya which is son tree of Sri Maha bodhiya, Anuradhapura. Went by Tuk-Tuk it was interesting to appreciate other religions. Good guide. Bought flowers as an offering outside for 100 Rupees (50p) in UK money. Would have cost £30 or more in the UK.. We had a very nice tour guide that gave us a tour around the whole complex. Place is very fascinating and i would recommend visiting. Reminder: You do have to take off your shoes when entering a religious area. This is an important place for buddhists. View is nice. Remove shoes before you enter. There is a place to keep them safe. Spectacular site! Wonderful huge stupa and temple with beautiful views of the surrounding river and railway / vehicular bridges - and no horrifically overpriced (and discriminatory) entry fees and touts. So serene! A must-visit place! We visited the temple of the tooth and found it absolutely crazy not what you would expect to find in a Buddhist temple extremely busy and loud . This temple on the other hand is exactly what you would expect . Peaceful , thought provoking and beautiful. you walk anywhere and feel at ease and the smells are phenomenal.  1 tip for anyone going , buy incense at a local vendor to instantly transport back there once home Relics were stored in a chamber, so we didn't see them, but the painted walls depicting the life of Buddha and his influence on the Sri Lankan king was interesting. Glad we did a tut tut tour that included going to visit this temple site. Really serene, calm place. Beautiful artwork and easy to walk around and look at everything. It's on both sides of the road with a walkway (subway) under the road. I enjoyed our visit. You can't miss this edifying edifice - wherever you are in Kalutara. It's a lot newer than it looks, especially after the brilliant white paint job it was undergoing during our visit. However, it's no less colourful for that. Remember to take small change to pay them to look after your shoes. The temple itself is very beautiful and well worth a visit just beware of the guides !!!! We were well and truly conned by one of the unscrupulous men. We arrived at the shrine opposite the temple and were met by a guide!!!! He was very informative and showed us round the shrine then took us beneath the underpass and demanded 2000rupees from each of us !!!! We didn't have much choice but to pay it he was very demanding. We then left him and went into the temple making a donation. This experience upset the rest of day. So please be aware of these horrible people who use a place of worship to extract money from you. We will not make the same mistake again !! A wonderful place to visit which looks great during the night time with the lights. It is located just next to river Kaluganga. There are two saplings of Sri Mahabodhi from Anuradhapura, planted here on each side of the road. So the temple is on both sides of the road. However the Dome is main attraction for tourists. I have been to some other Buddhist temples in sri Lanka/ Mayanmar/ Indonesia but this is the only dome that i have come across which is empty from inside and you can go in. there is one more dome inside this big one. There also a lot of pictures depicting the life of Buddha and also of his different incarnations. Nice place to visit as it looks really beautiful during the night time. A very calming place with the chanting by the monks in the evening, when I had visited it. A must see in Kalutara. It is on  both sides of the road with and underpass connecting both the sides so that you need not cross the busy road. Kalutara Bodhiya is an old Bodhi tree which is identified as one of the 32 saplings of Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi which was planted during the reign of king Devanampiyatissa We were lucky enough to see this during the festival it was amazing everything was lite up and people were everywhere really loved being apart of this This venerated temple has a prestigious history emanating back to the early colonial period. Once known as the Gangathilake temple, It was destroyed by the Portuguese to build a formidable fort to control cinnamon trade. It is now a most visited temple in Sri Lanka. The Bodhi (Fig tree) is known as a sapling of Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi of Anuradhapura This Buddhist temple is on your way out of Colombo to the south of Srilanka.You will never miss as all Srilankan drivers will stop and pray for a safe journey.You must  get down have look.Its one of the famous Buddhist temple in Srilanka. We visited as part of a trip around Kalutara, this is a lovely temple, very peaceful. Well worth a visit, especially as you can walk up into the dome Visited by many buddhists in the country and famous among both local and foreign. The place gets very crowded during buddhist religious festival days and this is one of the temples in sri lanka that has access to the bodhiya inside.. This serene temple situated on Galle Road in Kalutara and we saw many drivers stopped their cars and stopped over here for worship prior to continuing their journeys. There was a large stupa and a bo tree.  We were very interested at the inside of the stupa.  The place was really peaceful and quiet and good for meditation.  Recommend you to visit this temple on the way to Colombo. The temple was properly maintained through the purposely set up fund and you can donate the sum for goodwill. A world famous Buddhist temple in Kalutara. This temple is situated on the Galle road, therefore its a very busy & crowded place. Be cautious when crossing the road as its by the side of a very busy road. Much revered place by Buddhists, but it will be an interesting place for others too. Parking of vehicles will be  a little away from the temple. The Kaluthara Bodhiya is located in between the ocean and one of the main river in Sri lanka, it names Kalu Ganga. This place is very calm. Everyday many buddhist people come here and worshiped. And also we can go inside of the Big Stupa and there is a another small stupa for worship to the people. This Place is nice see who are traveling in Sri lanka. One of the first eight samplings of Sri Maha Bodhi planted here. All the respect should goes to Sir Syril Soyza for present conditions of the place. This large concrete dome shell structure was designed by Dr. A. N. S. Kulasinghe of the State Engineering Corporation of Sri Lanka. The Architectural consultant was Dr. Justin Samarasekara. It was the first hemispherical thin shell build in the country. Almost like a Egg shell. In certain period of times you can view Sri Pada mountain on the nearby bridge. Must see place. Car park is situated in the River Delta. visited with my familly ,its the landmark of kaluthara,make me pride as a srilankan..its like jem of srilankan history..also a great architecurel design and construction that its build on river bed..soo beautiful landscaping when you sit on middle of the bridge and looking around.. This a wonderful place to visit if you are passing by kalutara. Facing the magnificent Kaluganga ( river). If you can visit around 7am or after 5pm you will witness some breath taking views from the kalutara bodhiya. Do not forget to walk into the kalutara bodhiya. The uniqueness of this temple is you can walk into the pagoda. Its a wonderful experiance believe me. As it is religious place always remeber to where a decent attire. This Temple is well worth a visit. It's very busy in and around the temple grounds. There are guides offering to give you the tour at a cost, but you can walk around on your own. It's customary to offer a small donation to Buddha . If you have time for sightseeing,you will find not more options in this region. You fill find some paintings around the interior space which are related tonbudhists myths. one of the places i visited during my stay in Sri Lanka, worth seeing. had a tale of history. first view was from the bridge and then decided to go closer. My home town. As school kids visited ever day. Since I moved to Gampaha , when I visit my home used to visit & worshipping. I really love the place. I was curious to see how buddhist celebrate a holy day. It was a nice experience for me ( the first one ). I was impressed by the gentleness of the people and amused about children openness and curiosity. We came here knowing it is a free entrance Bodhiya. A guy took us in, showed us everything, told about its history, the tree, the rituals. Then asked quite abruptly for 10 USD so called donation for each person. Since we didn't bring that much money we gave him RS 200 and continued to see the stupa across the road without him. We were told it is the only stupa in Sri lanka you can go inside. There is very nice view, lots of people just browsing or meditating. It is quite calm place even though you can hear the street noise. Definitely worth visiting, just be prepared to take off your shoes and ignore the guide at the entrance. We were staying at at the Cinnamon Bey Hotel, Behruwala. My driver/guide suggested we visit the Kalutara Bodhiya as it is one of the only Buddhist temples where you can enter inside the Stupa. We had to park the car and walk through a tunnel under the road to get to this temple. Very peaceful temple. What amazed me were the beautiful paintings around the wall which told the story of Lord Buddha. The Kalutara River is also has good scenery. Definitely worth the time we spent visiting this place. Nice calm place. Buddhist people come and worshiped kalutara bodhiya. More people visit and worshiped this wonderful calm palce Very beautifull place, big stupa with all the orginal elements. Visit when their is a ceremonie. You can buy at the local market. ""Amazing such a beautiful building ! To read the story of Buddhism Must be seen in the day and night"" . best place to visit for  mind relaxing peaceful place.. lovely atmosphere and beautiful view will relax and please you.. You park on the other side of the bridge and cross the bridge, the temple is very beautiful both inside and outside. However it is worth a visit We first visited Kalutara in the night and the site of the lite dome was impressive. We went in the temple on both sides of the road and it was surprising to see how 'bare' the main temple is. Great to see at night all thevcandles lit outside under the tree and to smell the incense. Lot of local prayers there in every day , it's very nice architectural design , you can go inside of the temple and see it. River is beside the temple. Parking area is very big , easy access. This temple is located in the middle of the Kaluthara town facing Galle road.However it is a calm and quite place at night.Visitors can walk inside the Kalutara Chaitya to worship .This large concrete dome shell structure was designed by Dr. A. N. S. Kulasinghe . we were ripped off by people who told us we needed to pay to enter. You don't have to pay to enter, do NOT pay these people: donations to the temple should be put into the locked boxes available. such a shame we had this experience, the temple was beautiful, serene, well worth a visit - but please learn from our mistake. like food and bevarge,accomodation,staffs dislike the evening entertinment.band was not so good.im asking about evening entertinmnet bcs i like to enjoying the DJ's we were taken to this temple by our tour guide buddika when we were on our way to galle.i learnt so much of thing from this visit, If you are visiting Colombo and are interested in Buddhist temples, this is one of the main places to visit. It has a large stupa which you can enter, a rarity in Sri Lanka. Kaluthara temple is very famous between locals.there are plenty of activities going on every day.it's so beautiful because of Stupa.you can walk inside.on the top you can find drawings of buddas story.it's so glad to be there. Lovely peaceful temple; nice escape from the chaos! Remember to take your shoes off before you go in. I wouldn't make a long journey to visit this temple, however if you are less than 30 minutes away then give it a go! While visiting Kalutara we went to this temple , a very pleasant feel place , one can see lot of devotees offering prayer to Lord Buddha by sitting around the Temple. It’s on both side of road and is connected by Sub way . You can climb the stupa and see the upper storey and offer prayer.. This is the main buddhist temple in Kalutara area. Close to city centre. Easy access. By the the river . specially on Buddhist holidays you will find a large crowd of local worshippers here. this place is a real original temple and one of the biggest Dagobas in Sri Lanka. You will see it from the mainstreet when riding from Colombo into the south using the beachroad, or from the railwaytracks - Kalutara is where the nice beaches into the south are starting - loving this place and always try to visit it when ever I am in Lanka Whether you follow Buddhism or not, this place is really worth seeing. It is important to go to both sides of the road via the underpass to see the whole complex. We found everyone very welcoming. It is always very busy but they seem to keep it clean despite large numbers of people. Car parking is difficult. The views from the top of the large pagoda are worth the climb up the stairs. A beautiful place located in a river bank where you can spend some time with peace of mind. However, better to go there in a less crowded day, otherwise you wont be able to indulge in that serene feeling. A must visit place if you are around Kalutara This Buddhist temple is a world renowned place, it has a lovely Bo tree (sacred tree) & a beautiful Stupa where Buddhists love to worship. Beautiful Temple and well worth a visit. Take flowers or buy them outside the temple. Very educating information are available, if you want to know about Buddhism. Most of the times i visited kalutara bodi.it is a calm and quate  religious place.i invite all to worship kalutara bodi The outside of the temple is quite stunning but the inside let it down a bit - nevertheless worth a visit if you're in the area. There is no entrance fee, so make sure you don't get lulled in by a tout who wants to show you the temple for an exorbitant price  - rather give some money as a donation to the temple. Worth a look and read all the stories behind the pictures in the upper dome. Use the under road tunnel to view both sites of the temple The huge stupa is unique we were told in that it is one of the few that can be entered into. It has depictions of the Buddhas life and a view of the surrounding from its height. Very authentic place, pleasant aromas of incense, beautiful details and one of the best and largest bodhias of Sri Lanka. It's better not to come on Sunday, so there'll be fewer people. And it's better to go with a guide who will tell you about the traditions of their religion! We visited this temple out of season so it was fairly quiet inside. Buddha sits in the centre of the dome and on the walls of the dome are paintings of the Buddha story. There is no entry fee though a donation is welcomed. We visited the shrine over the road first where a guide (?!) wanted to charge us $30 to take us to the Bodhiya so beware. I visited the bodhiya with my family. Very tranquil and nice, despite the busy traffic on Galle Road. I recommend entering the bodhiya through the underground tunnel instead of crossing the road. I always try to buy my flowers from the old flower sellers near the bodhiya. A must see/visit place if passing by Kalutara. The temple was very interesting - the big one that is.  There is a smaller one across the road, but be careful. There is a gentleman who directs you there and tells you the only way to big Bodiya is from tunnel under the road. But he is directing you to the people who want you to pay them to look after your slippers and show you round.  The temple has big signs signing no entrance fee should be paid, only donations.  Make a generous donation instead. One of the Most peaceful and beautiful Temple in Lanka and when you pass kaluthara junction from Galle road , this is must visit place,  this is one of the few temples which can go inside the Sthupaha.  inside the sthupa we can see and explore the outside area from glass windows. and temple are was spread other side of the road we can cross the Galle road through under road tunnel. wear suitable clothes when visit there. in poyaday and weekend crowded. no need to buy tickets to enter temple, the pichture of the dagaba( chaiththiya) you see here is actually hollow and a concret shell.designed by a famed sri lankan engineer. inside yoy find a sall dagaba with relics. the oer sapce inside is similar to maluwa( ( perimeter) of a conventional dagabo, i t can accomadate thousands of people. the picture of the dagaba ( chaiththiya) you see here is actually hollow and a concert shell. Designed by a famed Sri Lankan engineer. Inside you find a small dagaba with relics. The space inside is similar to maluwa  ( perimeter) of a conventional dagaba, it can accommodate thousands of people. There are two bo trees. One beside the road is patronized by many. The other one is at the top of the hill beside the dagaba. It is a very popular bo tree among some Buddhists who believes some Bo trees have more divine attraction than others. The minute you arrive some local will approach you . Pretending to be a guide. When you give the lady your shoes keep the tag ,otherwise he will try and charge you at the end . But it’s all free!! Let him take you around he will explain it and show you where to go . But do not give him the donation at the end ,put it in the box yourself when collecting your shoes .

But it was interesting.",4.4,387,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/bd/03/e6/caption.jpg?w=700&h=400&s=1,0.8333333333333334,34.166666666666664,7.083333333333333,1.25,15.416666666666668,41.25
Keeri Beach,"Keeri Beach. visited the Keeri Beach with my family members and had really a great time in the cool waters. Shallow and safe free from rough surfaces and corals . Wind mills are along the beach to generate electricity. Located near Mannar Town to  Thalvupadu  road . Find Keeri Junction and proceed to the beach. There is an Ancient  Mosque with a Tomb of a saint on the other side of the Keeri Junction marked as Keeri Internal Road to have a quite time. Plenty of Palmyrah Products like dried Yams and The yam powder good to control diabetes . Yet to be developed with facilities for Tourism We had a hard time finding the beach, but it was worth it. Crystal clear water with no litter on the beaches. A calm and quite beach which spans a large distance. You need to drive through unpaved gravel road parallel to sea. Go towards the location marked as public toilet. There you have changing rooms and bathing facilities after bathing at sea. The sea is very calm in the days we visited and it’s just like having a swim in a pond. The water looks dirty with dust particles hovering around. I’m some days jelly fishes do roam around. So be bit cautious when having a bath. No any lifeguards on duty here. The beach is pretty much vacant.",4.5,4,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/2a/60/3f/photo0jpg.jpg?w=700&h=400&s=1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,33.33333333333333,66.66666666666666
Kirindi Ella,"Kirindi Ella. Scenic waterfall which is accessed after a steep 500 meter descent made up of steps. Entrance is paid but before 8am access is free. If you are coming from Colombo towards the hinterland, it is worth a visit Most beautiful   Waterfall experience  ,can bath in clean cool water stream. Top of Waterfall is piece of hewn,  must see place The drive up is a bit.. Interesting. Thank you to our driver for getting us there and back :) It is quite easy to miss, it is on the right of the sign that has the information on it. The path to the viewing is not so bad but if you plan on going to the bottom, be prepared with long trousers as it is very overgrown! We went up and parked up by the tea factory and caught a tuctuc to the entrance and had a wander down to the view point. Even in the dry period it looked pretty cool! Wonderful waterfall. However, this is not much famous in travelers. Around 100 steps down to the view point of the waterfall. But, if you want more adventure, you can go to the bottom of the fall. The route is not well cleared, because not much travelers use this. Anyway, this is a place you must go. 7th Highest Waterfall in Sri Lanka, Kirindi Ella creates an absolutely breathtaking view during the rainy season. Kuttapitiya road (the last 7KM ride to the waterfall) is very narrow and but in fine condition (as of June 2018). This is not the easiest of waterfalls to get to but is worth the effort if you are in this area. It is in the Pelmadulla area, several kilometers off the Badulla-Colombo main road. The road to the falls is not good but is accessible by vehicle.As with all falls, it is spectacular in the rainy season. The area has significant rainfall during several months of the year which adds to the likelihood of poor road surfaces and mud-slides but contributes to the wonderful lush green surroundings of these falls which adds to the overall beauty. The spectacular nature of the falls can be viewed from a reasonable distance or one can reach the falls by walking from the nearest place a vehicle may be parked. This is a hidden remarkable spot which you should definitely try. A huge amount of water is flowing through this waterfall.  Located at palmadulla. You can easily find it on google maps. Road is very good for any Vehicle.  Surrounding environment is also very nice along the way. Of you are in good physical condition you should  definitely try going to the bottom of watetfall. You can surely have a nice cool bath from here. The path is very sloppy. Highly recommend place. One of the best waterfall in Sri Lanka. A must do if you are in the area. You can walk across the river get your legs wet to see a great view of the falls. It cools you down. A good tip if you are driving or have a driver is to go all the way down the lane and park up at the hotel at the bottom and buy a few drinks before the short walk to the waterfall. The lane on the way down is very bumpy typical Sri Lankan style. This waterfall is located at Pelmadulla area. When you will be travelling in Colombo - Badulla road via Rathnapura, you have to turn left at the junction just before the Pelmadulla town towards the where Gankanna Central College located. There is a drive of about 6 km in that road to reach out to this waterfall. The road condition is not much good but possible to use a car. Please keep in mind that the read is a narrow road with bends. There is a name board in the road after driving about 7km in that road. You have to park your vehicle at a side of a road (no dedicated car park) and have to walk down from the road. After walking about 50m in that foot path (cement stair case is there), there is a view point which you can have a nice view of the waterfall. If you would like to go closer to the waterfall you have to walk more distance from that point. But it depends on your physical fitness. I have heard that is is possible to reach out to the top of the waterfall too. But still could not try it. This is a waterfall with the height of about 116m. The water stream connects to the Kalu Ganga at a later point.",4.7,10,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0c/3d/ee/6a/kirindi-ella.jpg?w=700&h=400&s=1,0.0,33.33333333333333,11.11111111111111,0.0,33.33333333333333,22.22222222222222
Kotmale Dam,"Kotmale Dam. It's the first dam in the Mahaweli project and the second dam from the up stream. Its visible from the main road from Ramboda. If you want to get closer, you can take the Ulapane - Pussellawa Road. There are various ways to get to this road. You can either come from Gampola or Pussellawa/ Tawalantenne side. We started all the way from Ulapane (which was a bit of a detour) since we wanted to see the Fools Bridge, which is visible from the Ulapane bridge. There is also a hanging bridge and then you get to Kotmale bridge. Google map directions are accurate and the road is in good condition. You have to pass the dam which is on the right side of the road, towards Pussellawa side for about 500 meters. Then you come to an observation point. You need to get a ticket which allows you access to a look out point and a tiny museum. Then you can take the same ticket and go back to the dam which will allow you to walk the length of the dam. As soon as you pass the observation deck and go towards Pussellawa, you get a left turn to Mahaweli Maha Seya. On the way to Mahaweli maha seya you also get a right turn to see ""Dehadu Kadulla"". This is supposed to be an entrance gate in the border between Ruhuna and Malaya and the very gate used by Prince Gemunu around 2000 years ago!. It seems to be in perfectly good condition. So I am not sure whether this is the real thing or a replica based on folk lore. Once you pass the Kotmale dam and go towards Pussellawa in the Ulapane Pussallewa road, you get to Ranamune Raja pihilla, another landmark in prince Gamunu's story. This is a beautiful paddy field with ""out of this world"" views and a famed fountain. A little while after, this road meets the Talawakele - Tawalanetenne road. It's best to take that route to get to A5 as the Pussellawa Road in not in good conditon thereafter. Also, while the roads were in perfect conditon, there were not many places to have lunch after Gampola. When we visited the previous time, we went to the Kotmale rest house which was a left turn-off before coming to the dam. There was also a home stay kind of place, right next to Ranamune pihilla, but we couldn't figure out whether they served lunch or not. If you know prince gemunu's story or if you have followed ""Ganga Dinge"" this would be a perfect road trip. Even if that is not the case, this trip does offer lovely views and an added bonus is that it is a rarely travelled road, so you can enjoy its beauty in all its pristine glory . Beautiful view. once you buy a ticket you can use the same to watch the reservoir and dam from observation point as well walk on the dam. Further you can see the kotmale dam museum. The road through the Dam closes at 6pm. The authorities doesn't entertain tourists hanging around and taking pictures but the walk is well worth it. Cool and interesting. Especially if you’re staying in the villa which was owned by the minister who had initiated it... Fortunate to visit the viewing gallery with family to witness first hand experience. Direct and closer view of the dam and surrounding offer great photo shoot opportunity. School children can learn the history of the dam, including output, processes and the construction milestones. Recommend doing the trek in good daylight. The climb down to the Dam is steep and you need good footwear. Once you get to the Dam the views are breathtaking. You really get to take in nature at its best and  mountain fresh air. You can get a Tuk tuk both ways for LKR 1000 from the entrance to the Pedro Estate Lover’s Leap division. Good place to relax and meditate .awesome quiet and hear natures sounds only .stunning scenery and lovely foliage ..a painters dream location . Kotmale Dam is a really beautiful and memorable place. View of Kotmale Reservoir from the dam is breathtaking. The mountain range behind, adds much more to its beauty. Unlike most of other dams in Sri Lanka, Kotmale Dam is a linear dam, with a length of 600m. Just make sure, you walk along the dam to the other end, to feel the beauty in full. And don't forget to observe Kotmale Mahaweli Maha Seya seen little far from the dam. Kotmale Power Station is the second largest power station is Sri Lanka. If you get sunny day, better. First you need to get tickets from visiting center, 30 Rupee per head. After you can come to dam Where you can walk. Vehicle allow only for resident Set in the beautiful valley of Kotmale, the view is amazing and is a must visit. You can either view the dam from the viewpoint or walk along the dam with a ticket. you will see a unique and beautiful view. do not forgot take a picture of this place. if you wish you can walk trough the dam but have to get permission from authority. The walk along the bridge was very exciting especially when all the school children joined us.  the views are wonderful and there is a little museum which explains the historical value of the dam  to Kotmale province. The Kotmale Dam view point is just a place to have the most gorgeous views of the dams, the lake and the surrounding waterfalls. It is just mesmerizing. Enjoy the games of the clouds over the lakes and the hills. The breathtaking views of the nature gives mind a fresh start. We will cherish the views for a long time. Its a great place to visit if you are in Sri Lanka and up country. There is lots of history involved which you will love to see and hear. Worth a visit. Make sure you plan other places to visit also if you travel upto Kotmale. This damn is in a very pretty place in the country. The area still has a lot of old Sri Lankan charm. I used to spend a lot of time during my school holidays when I was growing up in Sri Lanka. This area is a bit away from the normal tourist trail. Could easily spend discovering the area. You can visit this impressive damm. If you are there please stay in Mas Villa along the lake and love the view, the food and the marvelous staf. We visited the dam as part of a trip with a tuktuk in the area. First stop is at the museum at the dam viewpoint, where they charge the entry fee. The view from there was indeed very nice, providing the opportunity for some great photos of the dam and the lake. The museum itself had a few interesting pictures of the construction, but didn't contain too many other interesting things. Next up is that you can walk over the dam, which also provides a good opportunity for some impressive photos. Unfortunately, it is not possible to view any actual rooms or machines of the dam or the power plant. But nevertheless, it's worth to visit the dam and to spend around 30 min - 1h there. Well worth a visit if you are driving by! The view point area has a small museum with photographs of the construction, a miniature layout of the hydro dam and info about the project. Surprisingly, the construction was completed way earlier than the expected date, so that opening was moving forward by a few months! You can also access the dam itself, which is about 1 km away from the view point. Vehicles were not allowed when we visited in Nov 2016, but it was accessible by foot; very picturesque location! Also, do visit the Kotmale Seya (stupa) / Mahaweli maha stupa which is overlooking the dam. Its close by and well worth a visit! Kotmale dam and reservior are the most popular tourist attractions of the area. There is museum and view point at Kotmale Reservior. You can have a fantastic view towards the reservior from this view point. The Dam also can be visited but entry point is about 1km down the view point. Mahaweli Maha Saya is the pagoda built to commemerat all temples submerged during Kotmale project. It is one of the tallest Stupas in Sri Lanka. Other tourist attractions around the area are Dehadu Kadulla (ancient gate of Kotmale), Ranamune Pihilla (water spring used by prince Gemunu for bath), Morape Dewalaya, Pusulpitiya RMW and Ulapane False Bridge. Kotmale project is one of five major headworks projects under the Mahaweli Ganga scheme. The dam site is at Kadadora located about 6.6 km upstream of the confluence of Kotmale Oya. It is close to the Pussellawa-Ulapane road and is nearly 37 KM from Kandy town and average of 135 KM from Colombo. The nearest rail-head is Ulapane, 11 KM away. You might get the permission for access the site and there is a view point for your study purposes.  All the details about the dam project is available for you. Ideal for student, photographers and travelers.  In keeping with ancient irrigation tradition of Lankan, a modern large stupa named as Mahaweli Maha Seya is dwelling at visibly to the Kotmale dam. Love #nature #photography #driving #travel @shashikasign Pics taken on 20151003 Camera: Lumia 640XL The dam was very beautiful with a view present in Centre of big rocks.. It was likely long from the top view.. And the entrance ticket was around 20 LKR.. There are models and photographs were displayed at the time of built. The dam generates power and it was constructed underground. People allowed through vehicles on the road it must be an nice closer view since we visited late in the evening we were not allowed. On the way out there are local fruit vendors with fresh fruits were u can buy mainly butter fruit and seasonal fruit.. Purchase the ticket before arriving to view the dam as it is located 500 above the dam.Project Model is there in the ticketing premises.No vehicles allowed inside the entrance except nearby village residents.Evening along the dam could be very attractive Kotmale Dam is one of the few places to visit if you are in the area. Especially in the evening it is very serene with a great view on both sides, the valley and the lake. But more than the dam itself, drive further up to a well known route that takes you down to the surface of the lake. Here you find a semi sumberged temple which is apparently under water during Monsoon, and only appears during periods of draught. This story by itself was mystifying. There was no information about the temple in the site itself, almost like a less known gem. Devotees had to get into the water to face towards temple and pray. It was quite a sight, almost like seeing something ancient, historical and so mysterious. Kotmale reservoir is a part of ""Mahaweli Development Project"" and built during 1979 to 1985. There are two roads, one from ""Tawalamtenne"" and other from ""Gampola"". Road is not bad, but it's a mountain road. There is a view point and we had to take tickets from there. Tickets valid for access both view point and the dam. Don't forget to view the small museum near the view point. ""Mahaweli Maha Seya"" a pagoda built after the completion of Mahaweli Development Project also nearby. Located in top of a mountain. Don't drive there unless you are driving a 4x4 and you are a skilled driver. They allowed to photograph the place.So you can take lot's of nice pictures. Kothmale Dam is one of the most fantastic place that took my mind. It is  really an amazing experience. A huge project!! Cool,refreshing surrounding. I think that We as the new generation young people should try to  do such memorable and useful things for our country's next generation. Our Grand parents  sacrificed their houses, lands for this major project. And also their dedication is marvelous. There's a museum too. As a student i recommend this place for educational purposes. The dam was jus so so lika any other dam. Just located near the forreat that makes it more beautiful and more interesting. Only a few know that Kotmale is a historical city related to ancient kingdoms.  The newly built reservoir in late 70's adds glamor to this wonderful valley consists of ancient temples, waterfalls,  ttraditional industries and charming people. This dam is located at an alternative road to Nuwaraeliya (Little England). I encourage everyone to enjoy this peaceful environment by spending 2-3 hours in the vicinity.  My only worry is that there is a preferential treatment to visitors known to the management and the security. So others will have restrictions to enjoy the beauty. The Kotmale project is one of the five major projects undertaken under the Accelerated Mahaweli River scheme. The project was completed in 1985. It is not to be mistaken for the more recent Upper Kotmale Hydropower Project in Talawakale. The dam can be visited by paying a nominal fee and you can walk right across it. The reservoir and the surrounding mountains make up a peaceful view. There is also a tiny museum. The Mahaweli Mahaseya is visible from the dam. It is a gigantic gleaming 100 ft dome which houses a smaller stupa within it. The acoustics inside is amazing.  Its construction commenced in 1983 but still remains incomplete. 18 temples and 2 Hindu Kovils were inundated in order to build the Kotmale Reservoir. The late Gamini Dissanayake made the Stupa to compensate for the loss of these religious shrines. Some temples are visible when the water level is low. There is a lot of folklore attached to Kothmale including stories about Prince Dutugamunu.",4.5,33,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0e/05/88/71/kotmale-reservoir-view.jpg?w=700&h=400&s=1,0.0,25.0,3.571428571428571,0.0,21.428571428571427,50.0
Lunugamvehera National Park,"Lunugamvehera National Park. Peaceful and uncrowded park.  We were the only jeep in sight for most of the trip. Usual animals: elephants, deer, crocodiles, buffalo, many types of birds.  No leopards.  A more relaxed experience, good if you don’t need a constant parade of wildlife Outstanding trip. Best ever. Roads are more even than Yala. Best of all we saw two leopards. Had a really good look at them. Also saw two hornbills quite clearly. Several elephants coming quite near. Spotted dear. Birds of prey, painted stalks, bee eaters. Harsha was our guide and he was knowledgeable and patient. untouched and less commercial than the others. can see elephants in thier natural habitats. beautiful secenaries. We went on the safari organized by our hotel (Tranquil Wild) and it was absolutely great experience. We heard stories about overcrowded Yala National Park, where hundreds jeeps packed with tourists try to spot elephants and leopards... We wanted to have it an easy way and we got what we wanted - hundreds of birds, peacocks, several elephants, crocodiles, turtle, eagles...no leopards but we were still really happy! There was only one jeep beside us. Perfect morning. Go there! We set out at 5am for this trip but it was perfect. Just us in our jeep with a very good careful driver and a friendly and knowledgeable guide. it was peaceful and unhurried. We were in the park for approx 4 hours and only saw one other jeep. We saw a huge array of beautiful animals and birds waking up in the wild with no stress of even being aware of us being there. We visited this park in the afternoon having been to Yala in the morning, and far preferred it.   It was much less busy, and unlike Yala when we did see elephants, jackals etc we had them to ourselves rather than a scrum with scores of other jeeps arriving. Very enjoyable visit. So here is some information about this park. Very limited on information. Lucky we found some locals at Priyanthanee Hotel where we stayed. I don’t know local language but I can just say the things I had seen. First off, didn’t see any jeeps out front. This place is not commercialized at all. Actually we were the only ones in the whole park, on Sunday. We seen so many animals though. Wow. Incredible time today in the wildlife safria of Tanamalwila, Sir Lanka. Seen today about 100 birds, monkeys of course, elephants, deer, crocs, lizards, many peacocks, foxes and so much more. Will make a video on it soon so stay in touch on my YouTube. Epic! Forest Destine So if coming here I highly recommend finding a hotel to help you or take your time coming here. You might have to question things all day long even before you can find a Jeep, driver and even a ranger as a guide. But we seen so much. It was truly an amazing experience. Lunugamvehera National Park lies between Yala and Uda Walawe national parks. 184 species of bird have been recorded in the park, mostly forest birds and water birds.Sri Lankan junglefowl, Sri Lanka woodstrike, painted stork, Brahmin kite, grey hornbill and many kinds of Eagles can be seen at the park. It is a home to elephants, spotted and sambar deer, wild buffalo, giant squirrel, palm cat, sloth bear and leopards. We did an afternoon safari entering at Ruhunu. There are a lot of birds to be seen,  such as Asian Open Bill, Hoopoo and Hornbill, and if you are lucky as we were, you may spot a leopard. Varied and beautiful countryside. No crowds. It is very good national park.  And it is a new park for safari at Yale jungle.  There no many jeeps.  Only 5 or 6 jeeps are entering to the park every day.  Lots of animals with leopards and birds. Nice park with lots of animals to see. We weren’t lucky enough to see a leopard but we had some pretty good jackal encounters, 2 species of monkeys and more than 50 bird species. Our driver was very good. He drove slowly and carefully and stopped immediately when told by the park guide or us. His name is Walter, company name: Sellam Safari. mobile: 0702000097/98 The Jeep (fitting 6 people) was Rs 8000 for the whole group (4 hours turned into 5 hours). Entry fee into the park was US$ 10 (+ 8US$ service fee per group, + 15% tax). This is the ideal place to visit if you are looking for a peaceful and less crowded national park for safari. Lunugamwehera also known as the block 5 of Yala national park has many scenic locations around the Weheragala Reservoir. We saw many birds and animals during our visit and highly recommend a safari here as you can experience wild life without any disturbances. We saw: Redback jackels Yellow-wattled lapwings Red-wattled lapwing Changeable hawks Serpent hawks Malabar Pied hornbills Peahens and peacocks Western purple faced langurs Common hoopoe Black-rumped firebacker Painted storks Open bill stork Elephants Green bee eaters Blue-tailed bee eater Bulbul Munia Spotted deer Water buffaloes Crocodiles Grey mongoose Green pigeon It rained for part of our safari which I found very refreshing. Of course we had to put our cameras away for a while. After the rain we continued on. I got some really great shots of the wildlife, especially the birds!! Loved this place. My wife and I spent the whole day here during our recent Birdwatching Tour of Sri Lanka 🇱🇰. As others have said, much quieter than Yala and apart from Leopards 🐆, everything is easier to see and at a much more leisurely pace. Stunning array of bird life. We particularly enjoyed watching the Little Swift fly below us as we stood on the Dam. Lots of Asian Elephant 🐘 and Water Buffalo 🐃 (Feral) Spotted Deer 🦌 (Chital) were abundant as were Toque Macaque and and Tufted Grey Langur. We even managed to find a single Indian (Black-naped) Hare and the only Golden Jackal of the trip. A thoroughly enjoyable visit. Highly Recommended. Lunugamwehera National Park is a paradise. No more jeeps, very relaxing place to visit. Lots of birds to see. Elephants crocodiles and leopards also. Beautifully lakes ant two big water reservations. Many type of eagles. Very nice park with plenty of animals. Unlike yala this park is not crowded. Also the people who visit the PARK and the trekkers are more disciplined. We were fortunate to see many elephants. Two of which came charging at us. The veheragala dam adds to the beauty of the park. Lovely park indeed. Beautful scenery by the reservoir. Good place for some photo shoots. Saw plenty of sea eagles. The safari is quite lengthy but found it enjoyable. we were really fortunate to see two Leopards! That's after a long ride around the park. but it really paid it off! Went here this morning and we saw lots of birds .. one elephant .. stripe necked mongoose, spotted deer but no leopard! The leopard seems to be the gold star spotting that every one wants to get to see. But I really enjoyed the less busy safari and the forest itself is of such great beauty .. well worth the visit. Next time maybe we ll see the elusive leopard ❤️ We rated this National Park much higher than Yala its neighbour National Park which is more popular and therefore much more busy. We had a truly magic day there. Millions and I mean millions of lemon butterflies decided to hatch the day we were there and it felt like being in an enchanted forest.  The vegetation was lush and we had so many opportunities to see wildlife as there are much fewer safari jeeps visiting.  We were very lucky and saw a pair of leopards which made our day! We recently visited Sri Lanka to do a number of Safaris.  This little known National Park had beautiful scenery, a variety of animals - yes we even saw a leopard chasing a spotted deer and best of all we only came across one other safari jeep.  If you have the time, this National Park is certainly worth a visit, even if just for the serenity of being in such a beautiful place.We were able to take a number of great shots up close, except for the leopard as they move like lightening. We had a good trip with no other tourusts but regretted not going at dawn. Started at 10h and it quickly got hot. Saw some great birds and stunning scenery with wallowing wuld buffalos, jackals and deer but no chance of a leopard. We paid lkr 6000 to go in and lkr7000 for the jeep. Lunuhamvehera National Park or Block 5 of Yala National Park also known locally ad Yala Jadhika Udyanaya is a vast national park. Despite the 4 hours safari the number of animal sightings are sporadic with some crocodiles, peacocks, other birds, water buffaloes, spotted deers and some small monkeys. Rather uncomfortable jeep ride due to the rough trails. Hefty price for the safari and the entrance fees. No where compared to any African Wild Life Safaris. However if you are in Tissamaharama town for want of a better thing to do go for it but keep your expectations low and you may be surprised. A good Park with lesser number of visitors. The park is a lesser sized park compared to other National parks. we visited in September and we found animals were less, probably due to the fact that the season was very dry and hot without rain for the past few months. Animals are very rare during the daytime and were not roaming around much. Peacocks and Deer were very very common all around the park. Various types of Birds like Eagles and few small birds were found. The Bungalow we spent the Night was situated in a very beautiful location overlooking a lake but due to the Weather it was partly dry but was the home for a number of Crocs. A good place to spend the night feeling the breeze coming from the Park. Cook is available and you can provide materials to cook for meals. Electricity and Water is available This park is smaller than Yala which is shut for parts of the year, and therefore a bit more rustic and quieter. Lots of birds due to the abundant water and small number of elephants and water buffalo. Oh, did I forget to mention the leopard .  What a magnificent animal.  So lucky to view one of only a dozen in the park. Getting away from the crowd in Yala's main feature (block 1) we got to Lunugamvehera National Park. Actually also Yala but this is block 3! No traffic jams and here we did see leopards! Please do note that the drivers here are exclusively focused to find the prized leopard. Although it's wonderful to find them but it did give me the feeling nothing else matters. This park is one of the least visited parks as most people visit the famous Yala block 1. As a result this park is almost empty and ideal for bird, leopard, elephant, deer, bear sightings. I highly recommend a full day safari where the jeep cost will be Rs. 10,000. Make sure you book a Toyota Hilux cab or Mitsubishi L200 cab and never a Mahindra jeep because the Mahindra is uncomfortable and engine makes a loud noise scaring away animals. Also, check if your safari jeep front glass can be opened to give you a better view. If you visit this park make sure you go to Lunugamwehera and book from there and never from Yalal because safari jeeps in Yala take you to Yala block 5 claiming that it is Lunugamwehera where it is not!! It is only a part of Lunugamwehera which is also called block 5. Compare national parks in other counties such as in the USA, Kenya and in South America, this is a small park, but even in low season when I am visiting, there are still way too many visitors in too many safari jeep,, This is a total contrast to the the busy safari park at Yala, where the jeep drivers had no respect for the animals and were only interested in getting as close to the animal as possible, crashing into each other and frightening the leopard away so no one got to observe it. But in the lesser known Lunugamvehera, which we entered opposite Block 3 entrance to Yala, it was tranquil and peaceful as not many people use it. We spotted an abundance of wildlife, and we saw 3 leopards on our afternoon safari. In contrast to the terrible behaviour of safari jeep drivers at Yala, here the drivers were respectful of the animals and were content to sit quietly and observe the leopards. Would definitely recommend over Yala any day, which is much busier. This area is absolutely stunning. The scenery, trees and wildlife incredible. We saw 3 leopards in 1 day. We won't forget this any time soon. Lunugamvehera is one of the lesser known National Parks of Sri Lanka. It is not too popular with tourists, as a result of which the park is not overcrowded. The park is in the catchment area of the Lunugamvehera reservoir. The park contains Elelphants, leopards, deer and a wide variety of birds. The dead trees standing in the reservoir's water was a very scenic sight. I was lucky to sight a leopard late in the evening along with jackals, mongooses, deer and birds like Brown Fish-eagle, Crested Hawk-Eagle, Hornbills, Pied Kingfishers etc. Lunugamvehera is worth a day visit! Visited during August and it was very dry and dusty. Came out covered with dust and saw less elephants as they have all gone into dense jungle. But got the opportunity to eye some wild boars, lots of deer, birds, alligators, peacocks. Also had the rare sight of alligator hunting down a bird...Weheragala reservoir inside is very nice and refreshing place. There are lots of fish and can even get down and go closer and have a good foot massage. Landscape is really nice and varying...but wet season would be the best to visit as many jeeps were inside as Yala was closed. And visit in early morning which will give you more beautiful scenery. Yala has lots of animals but loads of tourists and queues. If a leopard is sighted it is bedlam. This was much more authentic. Less numbers of animals but they all seemed more active and we got to get into the forest on small trails. We had close encounters with 2 leopards and with elephants. We saw crocodiles in action and eagles and other birds as well as herds of deer. A great afternoon. If you are a wildlife photography lover like me, this is a must visit place. From elephants to birds to deers to caymans you'll get to see all these animals in one place. We went through the new gate which was opened to public on 17th December 2016. And we were the first lot to drive through one of their newly opened track. New gate is just 30 to 40 mins drive from Thissamaharama town. You have to take A2 highway towards lunugamvehera town and Turn Right to Lunugamvehera reservoir at L'vehera town. Drive all the way to the end till you reach the park entrance and ticket office. You will at least need a good 5 to 6hrs to roam around the entire park. More time the better. 6am to 6pm is the park open time. I suggest you go early in the morning or around 3pm in the arvo. We saw lots of elephants, deer, rabbits, crocodiles, beautiful birds and reservoir has a beautiful scenery. We entered through the newly opened gate  from lunugamvehera reservoir side so animals are not very familiar with vehicles so fan away as we reach . Very friendly staff . This is declared as Yala block IV. This park is not reechoed as Yala. This park is have nice landscape and there are lot of spotted deers are rooming around the park. There are possibility to site leopard as well. We had a grate safari trip in Lunugamvehera \\\yesterday afternoon.  i accompanied with My SRI  directors . We could see, Elephants,Lepored , Shamber, Spoted Deer, crocodile,  and more birds. this is beautiful park, no more jeeps, We used yala eco safari   jeep. Mr. Teddy was a driver. I visited Yala the DAY before it opened, so had no option but to visit block 5, Lunugamwehara national park. It's like the poor cousin of Yala, however the same entrance fees (Rs. 3,708.07) applies. This is before you pay the safari operator +Rs.5,000 per person. An expensive day out. Wonderful natural smell and surroundings, although everything was so dry and dusty. Spotted 2 leopards briefly before a car park of Indian safari vehicles arrived along with their diesel exhaust. Saw lots of spotted deer, peacocks, monkeys, eagles, crocodiles, monitors, but sadly no elephants. It’s September which means the annual closure of Yala National Park due to the  drought and maintenance. 2nd week of September with the long weekend I decided to head down to Yala and visit nearby wetlands and an alternative national park. we went to the park around 6 .00 am morning.there were only few jeeps at the entrance. no traffic was there like yala. we able to spot excellent birding , three leopards, two sloth bears and herds of spotted deers. we had only half day safari. but this is good for full day as well. We wanted to visit Yala National Park, but found out after booking the trip that this park is closed 1 Sept-15 Oct each year.  Disappointed we decided to visit Lunugamvehera National Park.  $100 for a driver, jeep and guide for 3-4 hours driving around the park.  We didn't see much and there were quite a few other jeeps because Yala was closed.  Saw a few elephants (3), 1 King Mongoose, lots of birds, spotted deer, barking deer, and a mouse deer.  Better than not going but do not expect much.  Leopards were no where to be found. I visited Lunugamvehera for the first time, couple of weeks back. This is the Yala Block 5 and the best thing was there were only us and another Jeep. The park is not crowded. Afternoon visits are recommended since there is a chance of seeing a leopard. Must have a good 4x4 and an experienced tracker. This time, on my way to Yala National Park, I decided to cross the Lunugamvehera National Park. I have entered to the park from Kalupaalama Entrance, Thanamalvila with a special permission. Soon after entering, you can have a river bath in Kirindi Oya river. Then you can proceed to Galge exit point which will take you to Buttala-Kataragama road. It is actually great experience to cross this jungle with your own vehicle. You can observe large groups of Spotted deer, Buffaloes and Sambur. You can have a rest on Weheragala Dam and that place is really beautiful place to be. Also you can hire a safari jeep for a tour as well. if you use your own vehicle, it should be 4x4 and should have high ground clearance. Our guide suggested this Park due to the closure of Yala National Park for a month in September. We were so looking forward to a full day safari at Yala National Park therefore we were obviously disappointed in the closure but we went to Lunugamvehera National Park with a heavy heart. We took the afternoon trip and was greeted by both an elephant and monkeys just at the entrance of the park which perked up our day. During the next 3 hours we saw lots of black faced monkeys ( whose scientific name I've forgotten ), many peacocks and peahens, spotted dears, iguanas, many species of birds including the pelicans, toucans, kingfishers, stocks, parakeets, white bald eagles, water buffaloes but just 2 elephants. We also visited the Lunugamvehera Reservoir. Overall it was a good safari , many thanks to our wonderful guide Sri Sanjeevan and our driver Rohan. We find the Park average mainly because in Malaysia, we too have many of the animals spotted in the park. Yala and its leopards would be better but then again maybe I'm biased. Thanks again to Sri and Rohan. I know lot of people are interested in going to Yala and the place is some what crowded. Two weeks back I was there with a person from the area. I saw at least 50 deers in one go and around 500 during the tour inside the park. We saw plenty of elephants as well. This area is adjoining the Yala block 5 which most of the tourist are not being taken to and the animals of the Yala stage 5 move into this area pretty often. As per the experience of the local person he has spotted 2 leopards during another visit and that was during evening. But during my visit I did not sight any leopards. This area has a lovely view of greenery compared to Yala. Lunugamvehera National Park is one of the major national park in Sri Lanka which situated and bordered to Yala National Park. You can visit this National Park via two (02) main routes as follows: Via Colombo>Rathnapura>Uda walawe>Thanamalwila to Lunugamvehera (approximately 231km) Via Colombo>Hambantota>tissamaharama>thanamalwila to Lunugamvehera (approximately 265km) By visiting here you could observe Wild Elephant, Wild Boar, Leopard, Wild Buffalo, Crocodiles, Spotted Deer, Rabbits, Peacock and variety of Birds.

Mahiyangana Raja Maha Viharaya,"Mahiyangana Raja Maha Viharaya. The temple is built in places visited by Buddha on his first visit to Sri Lanka. Behind the temple stands the Knuckles Mountain Range, which enhances the atmosphere of this place. This is a very sacred Buddhist religious place in Sri Lanka. It is believed to be the first Buddhist stupa built in Sri Lanka 🇱🇰. This is also the place Buddha stayed when he first visited the island. Apart from the religious importance, this is a very beautiful and calm temple. We visited at night time and it was really peaceful with less crowd. A must visit place for Buddhists . Mahiyangana temple is ancient temple in Sri Lanka. Accoding to ancient  records,  Load Buddha  came to this place and this was one place among sixteen places. Mahiyanga stupa was renovated  by King Dutugamunu and other several kings. Mahiyangana Raja Maha Viharaya is believed to he the first visit of Gautama Buddha. And it is an ancient historical site situated in Mahiyangana My wife, our grandson and I visited The Mahiyangana temple early morning on 22nd July 2019.  After parking our car, we walked along the 150 metre long eastern paved path leading to the gleaming bell shaped white stupa accentuated against the lush green mountain range beyond.  I later found that there are four entrances on the four sides.  At each of these entrances is a moon stone with carved animals, clearly wasted by the many feet trudging over them.  On either side of the moon stones are two sculpted guardian figures about 750mm high.  There were many devotees who had come to pay homage at this Stupa.  We joined them and circled around along with other devotees while capturing some interesting photographs. I learned that this had been the first stupa built in Sri Lanka.  Records show that it had been renovated by King Dutugamunu in the second century bc.  It had since been renovated on several occasions.  The height of the stupa stands at 120 feet (37 metres).  This is a prominent cultural attraction that had been declared as a protected archaeological site. On the western side of the Stupa sits the image house.  We saw many devotees there.  A Hindu kovil (temple) dedicated to the deity 'Saman' is also prominent.  No photographs were permitted within the image house and the kovil.  A sculpted statue of future Buddha Maitri sits behind the image house. Even though it was early morning on a weekday, there were many devotees paying their respects by offering flowers and engaging in prayers, seated on the white sands, in typical elevated - hands together posture. A new buddha statue that would be 84 feet (25.2m) high is under construction, a little away towards the south-east of the stupa. We spent a little over an hour at the Mahiyangana temple. Entrance to the temple is free. Visitors are expected to dress modestly and behave with decorum as well as remove their footwear before entering the temple premises. It is more than worth to visit this temple, surrounded by locals and no tourists , it gives a special feeling. We visited in march 2018 , but this is not anymore on the list0 A huge temple and a very significant temple in Sri Lanka. Always having some devotees. When it rains can get very muddy. This is the first place where Lord Gauthama Buddha has visited in Sri Lanka. So for all the Buddhist people, this place is very important. This is located in Mahiyanganaya City and please wear a suitable dress here, even though you're on a fun trip. Here you can explore a bit about the Buddhist culture. very nice place..it feels very comfortable for life.so happy to stay long time there.very good place for buddhist place We had a wonderful visit to this very historic temple despite the awful weather - it was pouring with rain and skies were grey as my photos show. Nevertheless, we waded through flooded paths to see it and were not disappointed. It has a magnificent approach with a long pathway lined with a wall that has elephants along it. This is reached through crossing a moonstone. The stupa is huge and the atmosphere peaceful and spiritual. This temple is very famous as it is believed to be the site of the Buddha's first visit to the island. Main attraction of Mahiyanganaya is the Mahiyangana Temple.. This is the perahara season for Mahiyanganaya.. must visit place if you are a budhdhist Mahiyangana Raja Maha Vihara is an ancient Buddhist temple in Mahiyangana, Sri Lanka. It is believed to be the site of Gautama Buddha's first visit to the country, and is one of the Solosmasthana, the 16 sacred religious locations in Sri Lanka. Mahiyangana Raja Maha Vihara is an ancient Buddhist temple in Mahiyangana, Sri Lanka. It is believed to be the site of Gautama Buddha's first visit to the country, and is one of the Solosmasthana, the 16 sacred religious locations in Sri Lanka. Authorities should take nessesory steps to preserve the beauty of this heritage site. Information center would be a good additive with some security staff and proper housekeeping. PLEASE NOTE!!! This is a review for Veddha people in Dambana Village near Mahiyanganaya, Sri Lanka (which I cannot find in any list of trip advisor). I was so eager to meet with these people, I visited their village and I tried to arrange a co-existance for 1-2 nights for the 3 of us of our group. First of all, the village was empty, then they would let us be with them without water supply, toilets and beds, just with 2 or 3 meals, they would show us the way they hunt (no hunting during August), they would show us some of their dance and songs... AND they asked for 70 euros per person per night. After our denial to accept this, we went to another settlement  near by to be informed that they would just arrange for a show with some music, dance and singing, then they would show us around the place and the way they hunt for 35 euros per person. Since our aim was to live with them some days we were so disappointed we left with the most negative impression. So, I can say without any fear, that the Veddha people attraction is a FRAUD...don't even bother to go and see them. As in most tourist attractions in Sri Lanka, their only aim is to get the ""bloody tourists'"" money and if you are sensitive enough, you will feel their dislike against ""westerners"" who they feel as responsible for all their poverty problems. I have to repeat what I say every time I write about Sri Lanka. It is one of the most beautiful countries I ever visited (top 3 of 35 I visited), its people are the sweetest of all I ever met, BUT in tourist industry they are unacceptable amateurs. A two hour bus ride from Kandy, the 'Mahiyangana Raja Maha Vihara' is a sprawling and scenic site of pilgrimage and veneration. You will love the ten kilometre, winding road that descends onto the plains of Uva Province. Sunrise and sunset are rather nice. There is a fee payable at the main ticketing box located opposite the main Vihara, where you will receive a lovely, glossy, folded information brochure. The grounds are expansive and photo opportunities are certainly available.... ... But not in the shrine room, of the main Vihara. The resident Sangha are friendly and welcoming. Bring 'dana' gifts and donation money with you, for the till boxes. Monks can only possess what is given too them. Unless the community provides, they go without. Shop in Kandy before arriving and fill up a big box full of things that you would appreciate having, if you were living life as a Monk. The museum is small and quaint. The local 'stray dogs' seem friendly. The most shocking accommodation options that I have seen in Sri Lanka are available. You're better off sleeping at the Monastery, returning to Kandy City or moving on (immediately) after your visit. It was visited by Buddha during his first visit to Sri Lanka, by playing role to mediate and calm the conflict of two tribes living there originally and turned the area and people to be Buddha's followers. We visited on our way back to Kandy after visiting the Vedda tribe. Great place to stop and wander around, although the large elephant at the rear that was chained up didn't look to happy. Mahiyanganaya Dagoba has a very good written history and it is one of the symbolic icon of Buddhists. Every Buddhist must visit at least one before end their life time and worship. Very peaceful area with beautiful nature as well. Must visit place for Pilgrim tour. Mahiyanganaya is a town situated close to the Mahaweli River in Badulla District, Uva Province of Sri Lanka. It is said that the Lord Gautama Buddha visited Mahiyanganaya on the full moon Poya day of January in order to settle a dispute arose between Yakkas and Nagas (two tribes then inhabited this area) and this was his first ever visit to Sri Lanka. Then the Lord Buddha preached Dhamma to Sumana Saman, a leader in this area, to whom the Lord Buddha gave a handful of his hair relic so that people could worship. After that Sumana Saman (now the God Sumana Saman) built a golden chethiya in which the sacred hair relic was deposited. Later on about seven chethiyas were built over the original golden chethiya from time to time, the last one being built by the King Dutugemunu. As such, this historic town is a very sacred place for Buddhists. At Mahiyangana Temple one can find the worlds first Buddhist Stupa which was built with the knowledge of Lord Buddha it self  during his first visit to Sri lanka just nine months after his enlightenment. The Stupa was built by God saman with a height 7 cubits placing Hair relics of Buddha given by Buddha himself in 6 BCE. subsequently monk Sarabu increased the height up to 12 cubits placing the GREEVA Daathu (Throat Bone relic) of Lord  Buddha,  then King Uddachulabaya increased the hight up to 30 cubit and King Dutugamunu increased the stupa to the present height of 80 cubits. Stupa is located in a beautiful location, on the side of range of mountains and river Mahaweli. One of the three spots Buddha came in Sri Lanka; the area is very clean (not like Kataragama); no entry fee!; a lot of attractions",4.5,25,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/06/9d/cc/6b/mahiyangana-temple.jpg?w=700&h=400&s=1,0.0,18.181818181818183,13.636363636363637,0.0,18.181818181818183,50.0
Mannar Island,"Mannar Island. This is a popular location for bird watchers. There lots of migratory birds during the season including flamingos. Beaches also. A very historic place and is said to be the closest place to India. The place seems to be modernising too soon and could harm the flamingos that normally migrate here with seasonal changes. It has very peaceful environment. Also this place does miracles. You can enjoy the nature there with a lot of space trees birds etc The tranquility of this place is being spoiled by major road development and the placement of up to eighty wind turbines.  The salt flats where flamingo migrate to are next to a set of road works and now the only way to see flamingo is to get up at 0500 before the traffic starts The beaches are mostly in use for fishing so are not nice or clean enough to relax and enjoy The area also has a major problem with drug trafficking and drug taking. We found a nice beach area only to be joined by a group of locals doing cocaine On the positive side we enjoyed a couple of walks beside the salterns and saw lots of painted storks and pelicans There is a lot of history and interesting places to visit, the Doric, where the world acclaimed fresh water pearls were found. Fort at Arippu nearby and a larger Fort at Mannar You have many places to visit at Mannar island although many simply ignore this place due to the extreme hot weather and less facilities. But it’s a must visit at least once. Mannar is famous for flamingoes in the migratory season. You can see them beside the road connecting Mannar and main island. Some of the major attractions are Mannar fort, thaleimannar pier and light house, thaleimannar beach, adam’s bridge, Keeri beach. The Adam’s bridge is a must visit from all of this. Specially visit in evenings, the sunset view would be amazing. If you can get navy permission they’ll take you on a boat ride towards the first island of town he adams bridge. On the way to Mannar you can visit Doric bungalow, arippu fort, Madhu church and thanthrimale temple. It's like stepping back to the Eighties! No fast food, just one supermarket, no traffic lights and NO TRAFFIC, but you enter a land where donkeys roam freely, Baobob trees grow amidst the thorny shrub, desolate white sandy landscape stretches for miles. Near empty roads, lush Palmyra trees and birds, hundreds and hundreds of them everywhere.  If you go off the beaten track, there's a stretch of beach which is completely isolated in parts except for a tiny fishing village or two. The silence only punctuated by bird calls is therapeutic, to say the least. I am of couse referring to Mannar Island, rather than Mannar on mainland. The only tiny disappointment was the Mannar Fort but the huge Baobob tree, supposedly over 800years old and, 22.8 metres in circumference, made up for it. The drive to Talaimannar Pier is absolutely beautiful,  hardly a single vehicle passes by. As if all this is not enough, a Donkey Clinic!!, over 30 donkeys live there and one can feed and pet them. We're definitely going back for the birding season, which is from November to around March I believe. beyond the dry arid landscape Mannar Island has more and more to offer. From observing the migratory flamingoes that escape the harsh winter to Kite surfing at Ayu, to an exploration of the old dutch fort Mannar is still raw and untouched and unspoiled by mass tourism. A good place and a admiring place with see more sea side view with more old port and near railway station too Went there as it was the only town in Sri Lanka that I had not visited. Not a great deal to see. However, there are some superb sea bathing spots close to Thallaimannar pier. Ask the Naval personnel on duty and they will guide you. The sea was the warmest it has ever been (in my memory) and the sun set is a photographers dream. This is an unfeveloped region of Sri Lanka but really worth going there if you're interested in birds. Nov-Mar is the best time to see resident birds but also many migrants. There are also quite a lot of wild donkeys - the only area where see these lovely animals - which were apparently introduced by Arab traders but not used by the locals now. Mannar has a manner, mythology and meaning, all its own. Located in the North West of Sri Lanka, the island is now connected to the mainland by way of causeways, creating easy access to this strange little place, full of donkeys, people and peculiar mannerisms. Mannar incidentally is the closest point to India and on a clear day, when the tide is low you can almost see our neighbours above us. Mythic tales tell of an invisible bride binding the 2 nations together, woven by jewels left like a Hansel and Gretel narrative by Sita when she was taken by King Ravana to Lanka. But this is 21st century Mannar and mythology has become a modern thing; multiple faiths and ethnicities reside here – as do multiple species of animals. You might find stray dogs meandering the streets elsewhere in Sri Lanka, but in Mannar, donkeys rule the streets. Old, abandoned houses named in honour of women with English names sit on lonely streets where two wheelers and four-legged ones occupy rush hour and colonial forts sit abandoned on the edge of little towns. Check out a travelzine called The Fowler for more interesting insights about the North! Enough to fill a couple of days starting from the Fort and working out to Talaimannar.  Baobab old tree is fascinating if a bit grotesque.  The pier at Ta.. is a sad story considering how important it was many years ago.  We even came from India though here with our Land Rover many years back. Lovely place to spend the day with lots of bird watching. We loved the natural beauty of the place and not too many tourists. The road could be better. We did not mind it as we were eager to explore Mannar. We were not disappointed. Loved It. This island connected to the Mannar mainland by a causeway is actually Thalaimannar. It's 30 km long and a few kilometres wide - in some places more than 10 km. It's part of the hot Northern province of Sri Lanka more than 300km away from the capital city of Colombo. It's human settlements have a colonial origin comprising Dutch Fort, numerous churches. The island is populated by Tamil Christians and Muslims using Tamil as the widely spoken language. The main source of income for the people here is fishing. However, tourism is beginning to play a major role, too. There's a saltern on the western side of the city. The city is dead on Sundays with most businesses closed to the public. Only a few convenience stores and restaurants are open on Sundays including the much talked about Choice restaurant. The island doesn’t still have many places for tourists to stay. There are only a couple of luxury accommodations in the island. There are a few comfortable budget accommodations, in addition. The main attraction of the island is as a birding site. During the migratory season November to March. Around 1000 Flamingos visit the island to feed on the crustaceans found in abundance in the saltern and other areas with shallow salty water pools. In January to early February beautiful pink color developing in primary feathers of Flamingos is a treat to the eyes of the birders - both local and foreign. Large amounts of Copper in the Crustaceans they feed on are responsible for this color. You must watch them flying to appreciate the true beauty! But, please don't try to chase them so that they fly for you to see this magical display. If you wait long enough at a safe distance away they will eventually fly above you, especially if you are lucky! If they do you should certainly try your luck in whatever way you like for the day!  In addition to the Flamingos there are numerous other birds to watch, especially several species of Ducks, Glossy ibis, Western reef heron etc. You got to be in field before the sunrise to witness the birds in their true glory. You must make it a point to visit Thalaimannar area as well for the scintillating ride and the sights including the old pier, fishing harbour with an abundance of terns and gulls in addition to egrets and birds of prey fighting for fish thrown away by the fishermen. The other attractions of the island include the giant Baobab tree near the city,  the Dutch Fort,  Adam's bridge etc. Wankalai sanctuary is only a few kilometres from the island on the main land which is home to a large population of migratory water birds. Driving on your own in this sparsely populated island is a delight. You can make the best use of your stay if you can spare at least three days here. You can reach the island by car, bus or train. Train and bus rides can be harder during hotter months as air conditioning is not commonplace in public transport to this part of the country. If you have a genuine 4 WD vehicle it's possible to take a memorable drive to Mannar from Puttalam, through the Wilpattu jungle during certain times of the year when the gravel road is not flooded. My wife and I visited Mannar on 25th and 26th December 2018 and again on 12th & 13th January 2019, with the main objective of watching the migratory Flamingos.  We were unfortunate during our first visit as the Flamingos kept far out in the sea near the causeway.  We were lucky during the second visit!! They were there in their hundreds at the Mannar Salterns.  They arrived early morning around 0600 and kept feeding in the semi-saline waters while making their typical clucking noise.  It was a beautiful sight to see them coming on to land with the sun shining on them against the blue sky.  There were quite a crowd gathered there to witness this scene that happens only during the migratory season from about December to February each year.  We were advised to wear dull coloured clothing and not move too close to the group of birds to avoid scaring them away.  There were bird-watchers with binoculars and photographers with long-lens cameras feasting their eyes on the flock of beautiful pinkish birds. In addition to the Flamingos we also visited the Pesalai, a fishing beach where there were many birds such as gulls, terns, and brahimini kites.  We also visited Thiruketheeswaran temple and the famed Baobab tree.  In the evenings we went around looking for other migratory birds.  There are many places of interest around this little islet, Mannar, that we had visited in our previous annual visits. The main road from Mannar to Talaimannar is not in very good state rutted with potholes.  There were not many tourists too other than those who came to see the birds.  It is not a very busy place.  The seafood in many a local eating houses were spicy and tasty. We will go there again next year!! The island has a long and varied history which would be nice to fully understand.  The island is not set up for tourists and you have to work for information.  Overall the 'not touristy' way of this place suited us. This is a good place for a silent getaway. However better to book a reputed place for meals and accommodation because I did not see many eateries/lodgings except the one I stayed. I spent the time in Talaiannar (Vayu resort). They provide bicycles free and you can bird watch too. Also yo may kite surf (paid activity) which is really exciting. Because this island was excellent for natural pearls many people came to trade with, greeks, roman, arabs and also was the shorter way to cruise india. But now is a lazy town and island with some beaches of blue water in the season and projects of big resorts. One of the best place in sri lanka for bird watching specially during migratory bird season (December - January). Lot of birds can be seen by the sides of south cost road, Punarin road and thaleimannar road. There are many places to visitt Mannar Island.Mannar fort, Biobab tree, Arippu fort, Doric bunglow, Vankalai sanctuary ,Widatalthivu Sanctuary ,Mathota Temple ,Thiruketheeswaram kovil, Talaimannar pier ,Adam's bridge,Light house, Giant's tank,Suspension bridge ,Giant's tank sanctuary and many more. This is good to spend a day.The accommodation is limited so have to early .The  old fort  Babok tree and the beach main attraction. The sea food is excellent. Though nothing much to see in Mannar it was a good drive from Colombo since the roads are good. Madu Church, Thirukkeswaram Load Shiva Temple, Mannar Dutch fort, Biobab tree, and Thalimannar Pier are few attactions around Mannar. Plenty on donkeys on the road. They said it’s a place to see Flamingos but we couldn’t see since it was not the season. Maximum one day is ok. Beat clean view . Nice view and relaxing environment. Place to visit and relaxing walk along the sea We drove from Jaffna,  the journey out and the entry into Mannar is pretty . Mannar town itself is featureless. For the tourist lacks even the bare necessities - food, toilets etc . Development upside is when trading  and travel to/from India recommences. In the interim better bang for spend in Jaffna and surrounds . Probably there are experiences if you want to find a hamlet and pretend that you are a villager for a period off the grid! You need to visit to this peer which is in Mannar Island. The peer now very damaged & not allowed to go beyond this point. The island can be travelled by bicycle or by scooter. We went all the way to Talaimannar to see the lighthouse and afterwards we watched the sunset at Keeri beach (bit disappointed by the garbage there). A lot of donkeys on this island, hence the nickname of the citizens. Not a lot of tourists so a totally different vibe. Mannar - no words. Simple, calm, peace, ... and lot of donkeys :) Fishermen's cottages, Indian ocean, shells. Only few accomodation, but enough. Please visit this place late evening as the sun is very strong until late evening.  The light house looks so magnificent and you can look out to the sea when you stand next to it. I am sure that a visit to Mannar in sunny weather would be a very different experience.  However we travelled out of season, the skies were gray with occasional rain, and generally it was a bit miserable.  There didn't seem to be very much to do but perhaps a bit more research would have brought better results.  But if you have to choose then I would say Jaffna every time. The Mannar area is mainly aimed at bird watching. If you arrive at your accommodation early then take a drive out to the lighthouse and see the jetty at Adams Bridge which is the closest part of the coast to India. Its nothing special but most people do this. Amazing place nice people here in Shri Lanka. When you see this palace you can check India is too close. without any glass instrument, you can check  India. History of Sri Lanka and India where the Ramasetu bridge is. there are lot of islets supposed to have been remanants of a bridge built by Rama king of India when he came to rescue his wife Seeta. Good for seafood and very few places where you have comfortable accommodation therefore you need to book in advance We stayed in mannar for 2 days but we found that there was not a lot to see. One day is enough to visit the whole island. The drive to Mannar from the main island of Sri Lanka is amazing! The ocean on both sides and the blue skies above it is almost like a postcard! The first attraction you will spot when you get into Mannar is the dutch fort. Definitely worth a visit! Most of the fort is intact and you can walk around and take some photos of the ocean from up there. Further down the road, you can visit the Baobob tree which is the tree with the largest bark in Sri Lanka. The tree is not native to Sri Lanka so its a mystery as to how it actually got there! Rumor has it that Arabian sailors brought it over ;) From Mannar town, you can drive up to Talaimannar which is home to the naval base and Talaimannar pier. The pier was used to board ships which go to India back in the day. Sadly, the ferry service is no longer active. On the drive to Talaimannar you pass beautiful scenery on both sides of the road. If you get down and walk off the road you will see that the white sand is covered by beautiful little shells! The area is aptly named the Shell coast cos of this. Right along the drive you will see heaps of Donkeys strolling along the sides of the roads which is quite and unusual sight for Sri Lanka :) The island has its own little post office which is the furthest most post office towards the west of the island. We bought some post cards and sent it across to ourselves from there as a fun little souvenir :) When back in town, make sure to visit Choice restaurant which is a small cheap food shop. Amazing fried rice and Biriyani available for Lunch and dinner. 5 of us had food and drinks, and the bill came to only LKR 1,500.00 Mannar island is definitely a must see for all locals and foreigners :) Just make sure to hire or drive your own vehicle since there is a lot of driving around to do :) Wonderful. Unbelievable. Mannar is a hidden gem in Sri Lanka. Suggest travellers to read the book ""Discover Mannar"" by Mr.Amrith Gnanam before visiting Mannar. Ideal for birding, photography and relaxing. Mannar is an Island off the mainland Sri Lanka. However district of Mannar covers parts the mainland. Key sites you may be interested include 1. Silavaturai, Arippu, Coastal wetlands and archaeological sites 2. Vankalai Bird Sanctuary and beach 3. Silavaturai, Aripput and Vankalai coral reefs, undiscovered live corals 4. Talaimannar Pier, Adam Bridge, several archeological sites and Pesalai fishery harbour 5. Mannar Port and Mantai port 6. Madhu Church, religious sites 7. Vidattaltivu lagoon and extensive coastal habitat with mangroves Climate & Geography Avg Temperature December - Feb 26C April - June  above 29C (Avoid going during this time) Rest of the year - 28C History Talaimannar is 18 miles away from india and during good times was a centre of trade and sea routes. Baobab tress and donkeys are a reminder of this even to this date, that traders from Arabia frequented this place. The fact that dutch chose to build a fort also goes to prove its bygone hub status. Kuweni, as the legend has it is from Thambapanni which is in Mannar district of Wilpattu reserve though not in the island. Adam's bridge or Hanuman's bridge also is there though there are no formal tours. Modi went to Talai Mannar to initiate a train service back in 2015 is still showing its strategic value to be connecting point to the Asian Railway Network. Wild Life Mannar sees migratory birds during seasons, especially flamingoes. Wild donkeys and poneys too can be seen. Coral reafs are also available. Again no formal tours In past, mannar was famous for natural pearls; though it is not commercially done now at large scale. Go to keeri beach Economy Economy is mainly based on fishing and agriculture. Food If you are in mannar, eat sea food. Prawns and cuttle fish are out of the world, but you need to get them fresh and cook. Only one proper resturant imo (Palmyrah). THough small shops also serve tasty curry. I am told cargills has opened in mannar town; please check. If not, take plenty of water bottles. Travel No 95 petrol is available in the island, Last station apparently is in Madu. Use TukTuk but discuss the rates prior to travelling. If difficult get help of a resident. THere are air conditioned buses between mannar and colombo. Leaves Mannar opposite Sri Lanka telecom. We rented two bycicles to explore the island. There are no real special things to see but its just a wonderful way to get to know mannar and its people. Everyone we met was really nice and helpful. There are also many small shops on the way where you can buy drinks and snacks. Be prepaired for the sun. There are not many shady places. To deive from mannar to the lighthouse it takes something about 3 hours (slowly driving and stops included). Was hot and exhausting but definitely worth it! The sea is gorgeous, not an over crowded town, so peaceful and beautiful. Now there are few hotels.  You can drive to Talaimannar where the sea is also so gorgeous.  Real out of the ordinary place. Lot of birds. Once there was a very to India. You can visit Adam's Bridge. The only place you can find the Baobab Tree in Sri Lanka. A lot of wild donkeys. Old Portuguese/Dutch fort. Even though this listing is say Manna Island, the best place to visit here is Talaimanna Pier. This is a very old pier, earlier used to transport goods from India and other countries to Sri Lanka through ships. Also, earlier time, there were a train service connected to ferry from India to here. You can see all these places if you go here. Mannar is a sand island in the arid north of Sri Lanka. It was badly affected by the war and is only now starting to get back on its feet. It's a different experience to the rest of Sri Lanka and is worth a day or two side tour. You can arrive via bus or train. The journey across the causeway to the island is beautiful at high tide. There are donkeys throughout the island left by Arab traders. The donkeys are small but quite tame. They were the local taxi service for centuries but have been neglected with arrival of motorised vehicles. Bridging Lanka (48 New Moor st) are setting up a donkey education centre just outside town. They will shortly be running tours to try fund caring for these donkeys - contact them if you want to try set up a tour as we got to pat some beautiful well cared for donkeys in our visit. The baobab tree dates from the 1400s and is enormous. The local cathedral is nice. The Dutch fortress Is just at the end of the causeway on the island while it's small and was used during the war, you get great views from the walls.Just across the causeway on the Jaffna road is an ancient Hindu temple (Ketheeswaram) which is spectacular - and not a tourist in sight (remove shoes, men must remove their shirts and women must have shoulders and knees covered). Part of the temple is being restored and you can walk around the building site (!).  The Giants tank is a well known bird watching spot. Baobab guest house can provide tasty lunch for about $5 (if you want curry and rice they need a few hours notice but if you want egg and toast, shanthi can whip that up quickly) or the local ahash hotel was about the same cost. Mannar may not have the highlights of other parts of Sri Lanka but if you want to know what life is like for everyday Sri Lankans then this is a lovely stop over between Anuradhapura and Jaffna. Hot dusty water problems unpleasant poor food choices really I wouldn't go out of my way to see this place Sri lanka is an island and mannar is an Island that belongs to the main island. despite being an island it has no place to visit except the mannar fort which is very small and abandoned comparing to galle fort or trincomalee fort.. Rhe drive from mannar to thalai mannar is teally beautiful. Can see bird life there as well and saw several photograpgers with massive cameras taking pics of birds. Must visit if you re in mannar. First the geography. Mannar and the associated tip  of the island,Talaimannar form the bottom claw of the Jaffna pincers extending into the sea. Mannar is slightly inland and Talaimannar is the tip. The two reasons why any visitor would want to visit this place are birds and history. The birds are quite exotic and plentiful in the area. The historical currency of this place is enhanced by the tale of Ramayana, an enduring epic in Sri Lanka and India. Talaimannar forms the Eastern edge of the fabled Adams bridge. On a good day and low tide, you can see the opposite end of these sand bars. That's all there is for the itinerant visitor. The drive from Mannar to Talaimannar is an hour an a half. The roads get progressively worse. Lot of military presence and a naval detachment right at the very tip of Talaimannar is a bit of a dampener. To reach the closest sandbars,called island 1 and 2, the help of local fishermen needs to be requisitioned. From the Indian side,Dhanushkodi,access to the sandbars is better. Reaching Mannar from central Lanka is on the A14. From the North,it is the A14. The roads are black tops for much of the way. Closing Mannar,the roads are not well lit and rough for long stretches. Advise against driving in the night. The arterial roads are patrolled by the police actively. Max speed is 70 kmph. In town limits are 40 to 50 kmph. The approach roads roads unlike much of Sri lanka are straight and don't wind. Food and overnight residence in Mannar are limited and average. It would help to carry food of choice and be prepared to stay in basic lodgings. An overnight stay with food should be no more than 60 usd per person. This is Mannar. Talaimannar has no amenities. Plan all trips by day. Avoid the rainy season. The local food is delicious but fiery. Breakdowns on the roads can ruin your timetable.Four wheel drives are best and a local guide recommended. Hospitality is unflaggingly super. Enjoy the trip ! An under developed area in the remote north western area of Sri Lanka it offers little or no 'tourist' attraction,  However to all those bird lovers out there - its a great place to be during the winter migration of birds.  The flamingos are the greatest attraction not forgetting many other species of migrant birds Nice place to visit but extremely hot atmosphere. Four Tees inn is recommended for a family stay but make sure you get the new rooms at the back which have a very nice environment, with it's tiny petting zoo with rabbits and ducks. Visit the Pier to grab a ride to Adams Bridge Excellent birding during the migrant season.  September to April. Especially  Flamingos , Waders and Ducks. A laid back beautiful part of Sri Lanka There is nothing much to do or see here. The migratory bird sightings and habitats are on the mainland beyond the connecting causeway. The ferry and he train to Talaimanar do not operate anymore and there aren't any formal tours to the Adam's Bridge. There are a few lackluster beaches and Navy patrols many of them and do not allow bathing. Tuk tuks do not have meters and their fares are extremely high here. Hard to find regular brands of bottled water, alcohol or supermarket goods. It's a dry, hot laid back experience. You can see a few wild donkeys and birds There is nothing of great interest here. I wasted a day coming here to visit. It's a backwater . Dont waste your time. This is must visit place and the largest island of Sri Lanka. Mannar Island formerly called Manar Island, is part of Mannar District, Sri Lanka. It is linked to the main island of Sri Lanka by a causeway. It has an area of about 50 square kilometres, mainly covered with vegetation and sand. Ram setu is a chain of limestone shoals, between Pamban Island, also known as Rameswaram Island, off the southeastern coast of Tamil Nadu, India, and Mannar Island, off the northwestern coast of Sri Lanka. Geological evidence suggests that this bridge is a former land connection between India and Sri Lanka. We had a nice and wonderful time. It was an amazing experience to all of us. The weather too very conducive for the most valuable boat trip to see the islands. Beautiful sceneries around.  A bit of advices are please take ample drinking water, some biscuits & sandwiches as less places to have meals but can manage. It was a one day trip for us and was really worthwhile Mannar island can be treated as one of the best place to visit. This place can be treated as best place to see wetland birds and some of the ruins, The weather is fair in the later and early parts of the year. Mid year is very hot and dry. October to early February is good for bird watching, since most of the migratory birds can bee see there We visited Mannar on hearing that migratory flamingos had arrived there.  We were not disappointed and saw two large groups of flamingos numbering over 700 in each group.  They were a little too far for close up shots with my 400 mm lens.  I now feel sorry that we did not visit them early morning for better photographic shots!  If you move close they move away!! We also saw the big baobab tree with a girth of 19.5 m said to be planted by Arabian sailors around 1475. The Doric house was another historic attraction.  The then British governer of Ceylon, Sir Fredrick North, had occupied this building around 1800 to personally supervise the thriving and extremly lucrative pearl fishery in and around Mannar.  The building is in ruins and could be better managed by the authorities.  We also visited the light house and the Dutch Fort.  There are many other interesting places to be visited around Mannar as we spent most of our time looking at the Flamingos.  We certainly shall visit Mannar again to see the other interesting locations. its about 120km from jaffna town.. we had a nice bike ride to mannar with friends.. there are some tourist places like thalai mannar adams bridge its around 30km straight road from mannar town.. we can see the bridge and beach and some fishing places... keeri beach also wonderful beach to take bath and a dutch fort and baobab tree and good food stalls to taste traditional food are there.. hot climate is irritating otherwise everything fine... This is an amazing place. One of the drawbacks I noticed is not having many places to eat well. Other than that the beach is awesome, people seem nice as well. There are so many things around to watch. If you come by a vehicle I suggest you to go and visit the Kanchukulam Hanging Bridge. Mannar is well known for it's birds. But there is more to see, like an old Dutch fort, the mansion of the English govenor and the famous Baobab trees which you will only find in Africa. Mannar gives travellers a very different experience to the rest of the Island. You'll  see donkeys roam freely on the streets. Vast landscapes and a very diverse culture. Mannar Island is accessible by both train, bus or car with excellent roadways for both modes of travel. It is a coastal town. #Hotel #Agape is one of the places which is very good. The #Portugese Fort, the #Baobab Tree, #Church of Our #LadyOf Madhu, Talai Mannar pier are must visits. Even the Northern capital Jaffna is accessible over an excellent short cut road within 2 hours. Hot, windy and clear sky all round the island. This island combine to main island in a small bridge. Families living here doing fishing, one Naval base with Police station in there. Not much to see or do, except some small sites. Nontheless Mannar is a nice place to visit. Definitly if you like to see wild ... donkeys!! They are all over town Things to do include seeing/visiting Adam's bridge, old and very big Bilbao tree in the centre and .... Different climate than the other sides of Sri Lanka. Windy and hot.specialy the Adams bridge.some sandy islands with small plants.soo many birds were there. Unfortunately no flemingoes were seen. This place is nice and different. I like mannar than Jaffna. The city is still developing so u will not find many things here. Saw a food city., sathosa, but the only reliable and good food place is choice reataurent. Located at Centre bazaar rd in the city. Mannar island is a place where we could visit many places which are important historically. Moreover lots of fantastic senses are also available. The town of Mannar is pretty scruffy with few amenities. It is a very mixed community that appear to live in harmony. There is a beach about 6 kms away and one at the end of the railway line, but they have quite a lot of rubbish. One would be a brave woman to swim in a swimsuit I was subject to a fair amount of sexual harassment and I'm 65! The newly constructed railway line is very pristine but I'm not certain if any trains actually traverse the length of the island. The old ferry pier which was used to link Sri Lanka with India is very dilapidated and the only talk now is of a bridge. After the war great endeavours have been made to restore road and rail links that are both now excellent. The route into Mannar is long and straight and passes some stunning waterside landscapes - very similar to the journey into Jaffna. The main shopping area is the Grand Bazaar. Apart from the ruined Dutch Fort the only other building on a grand scale is the impressive cathedral/church (again similar in design to the one in Jaffna) We found that there was little choice of places to eat and there is an absence of any quality tourist accommodation at the current time The drive into the island on the causeway was beautiful. The fort was not much but accorded a nice view of the surroundings. The island itself was charming, only place you could see wild donkeys. A good pit stop enroute Colombo to Jaffna though will not come here specifically for a visit as there's not much to see. Mannar is one place in Sri Lanka where you can find a variety of exotic birds including the Flamingos. That seems to be the only reason one would ever go to Mannar. Ruff, Grebe, Open Bill painted woolly necked and adjutant storks, Pintail, Garganey, Spot billed duck, Teals gulls and terns Grey Francolin, Peafowl ..... The varieties are a lot.. Great place for birders to be I visited and stayed here for a night as part of a Sri Lankan coastline cycle tour and then a year later as a self drive, it is a little conservative, and not touristy, many police and checkpoint controls. The new bridge leads into town, the old blown up bridge still visible to the right, there is a central town roundabout roads lead off, shops and a bustling market surround, impressive religious buildings to see, a fuel station and many banks with cashpoints and donkeys everywhere. in wonderful weather we visited Mannar during 3 days. That was enough to explore and we loved the sight seeing, even after the floodings that took place 14 days before. Lots of birds to spot, friendly people. Unfortunately a great part of the road is in horrible condition but this Island has a real potential to be visited by tourists. Mannar Island & the close by area of the main land possesses a very unique socio-cultural and geographic profile  in comparison to the other parts of Sri Lank. This is the largest Island belongs to Sri Lanka ( nearly 40 km in length and average 3 km in width. connected to the main land by a 3 km long road and a bridge at the entrance to the island. The sea which is on the both side of the road is just 2 feet deep in the high tide and becomes a massive dessert of white sand during law tide. Main attractions - Mannar Fort can be seen on your left when you enter the island. This was originally built by the Portuguese and further fortified by the Dutch and British and is still in a pretty good condition, and now are under preservation project of the Archaeological Department.  No tickets needed. There are few Dutch Tombs in the premises. - Adams Bridge at Thalei Mannar- Located around 35 km away from the Mannar town, Can be reached by Mannar - Thalai Mannar main road by Bus and Train. Public transportation goes only up to the Talai Mannar small town. The Adam's Bridge is the narrow belt of sand reefs and atolls runs from Thalai Mannar to Danushkodi at Pamban Island of India. Approximately 30 km in length  200 m in average width and 2 ft in average elevation , controlled by Sri Lanka Navy. During the day time between 7 am to 4 pm visitors can go there on private boats that can be arranged talking to any of the fishermen living there. In October 2015 it was 2500 rupees for a pack of 6 people for a 2 hrs visit. The boater should provide slandered life jackets to all the passengers and passengers must be wearing it all the time they are on board. if not sometimes the Navy even will send you all the way back to the shore cancelling your trip. after 4 pm you can not stay there under any circumstances. hope this will change in the near future to a level that you can camp in the night with special permission. Extremely warm and dry, better keep hydrating yourself through out the journey. - Fort Arippu - A small fort located on the road to Puththalama via Silavathurai. You can see the ruins of a small fortification originally done by the Portuguese and occupied by the Dutch and the British latter. - Doric Mansion - Located on the shore on the same road passing the Fort Arippu. One of the mansions of the 1st British Governor of Sri Lanka (then Ceylon). The mansion is in ruin but still you can see the great brick walls and arches. Kudhiramale Cliffs point in the shore of Vipattu forest, Thiruketheeshvaram Hindhu Temple, The Giant Tank, The Catholic Shrine of Madu, St. Lucia church, Baiobab trees, Sandy jungle beaches and couple of sanctuaries are located in the Mannar island and the adjoining main land. I first visited Mannar in 2010 and have gone there more than 20 times. Nothing much in terms of entertainment. but if you are interested in just observing a unique social set up, some of the oldest catholic customs in the south Asia, and colonial History, Mannar is awesome.  Not very developed in comparison to the other parts of the  country. Around 20 Hotels are found in the area. one of the hottest and driest climate in the country. A quiet place by the sea full of wonderful people. Go to experience authentic village life. Stay a while and volunteer at an NGO. Help look after the Bridging Lanka donkeys. Visit the sites but stay and meet the people you won't be disappointed. The town is full of wildlife and domestic animals. The bird life here and in the Mannar Province is abundant. Visit Keeri Beach and help clean it up for the future. Take long bicycle rides around the town and the villages.  Take a three wheeler to the mainland and visit the sacred Hindu lake and temple. You can now catch a train directly to Mannar from Colombo or anywhere along the line. Its great to visit in July and August because the winds are up and it cools you down.  The mornings and evening are very pleasant and the breezes are wonderful. We stayed at Palmyrah house which is on the Island.  The island is quite hot and dry with lots of donkeys.  You can visit the Talaimannar pier from here.  Fun fact: From the pier it is closer to travel to India than to Mannar town!! Visited with family and its a nice place to visit. mannar fort , Bio bab tree ,lagoon , Iron / steel light house in Urumalei, beach and shopping in Mannar town are interesting. Brought good dry fish and they are reasonably cheap. Do not forget to see the sand banks of Adams bridge. carry extra water bottles, a good binocular , shades and caps. Area is dry and hot . Cotton/ linen  is the most  suitable attire. There are lot of things to preserve in Mannar ford and its a very interesting place. We never feel that we have such a beautiful landscape in this country until we go out for a holiday. Mannar is a separate island connected by a beautiful causeway to the mainland. It is a fishing island, covered with palmyrah trees on typical white sand. People are back to their normal life after ending the war but war damaged buildings can be seen here and there. The life of people are very simple, genuine and they are not that corrupted like in the city people in many other parts. I was amazing to see the selling price of dried fish as Rs. 200.00 /kg ($1.5/kg). We were unable to watch birds as it was not the birds season. Finding a good restaurant is the most difficult and some people speak only Tamil. The causeway connecting the island with the mainland is once again passable. This is the ideal time to watch Flamingoes in Mannar. Thousands of birds could be watched in the salterns. Wild Donkeys are straying all over. I am not sure whether it is closer to India that Mannar Island has a very close similarity to South Indian villages. Avoid going during the warm seasons (April - June) as the climate is naturally hot. On the way you travel, expect herds of cows alongside the main road. Mannar is one of the only places where you can spectate donkeys aside the road. Go to the seashore and have a conversation with the local fishermen. They have interesting stories to share. I do hope they protect the island and educate the locals about how precious their land is for all the resident and migrant birds. An island, connected with manmade road/bridge over the ocean/laggon. Developing gradually and becoming a attractive place. Famous adams bridge connects from here i.e Talai Mannar. Some good beaches around - and mostly low laying areas. You may find difficult to get a good food though unless pre-organized. Though fried rice/curry commonly available. but a must see! we travel all over the other parts of the world without seeing our own Island , so much to appreciate. We stayed at Palmyrah House which was a nice place with great meals & a pool. Mannar is a very different side of Sri Lanka than we have seen so far. It's a very poor area recovering from the conflict. It's also a dry zone so fewer trees and no hills here. Very few tourists here. Local people friendly & many speak English. The bird life here is amazing as well saw cows, goats, donkeys, frogs, huge fish, wild horses and of course dogs! It was a very lovely experience at mannar. The island has a beautiful environment although it's hot and has few attractions such as the longest brigde in SL, Dutch fort and the tree which has the biggest trunk (Baobab). But the road in Mannar town is horrible. People are very nice. Practically all of the time I was the solely foreigner around - a strange sort of sensation, with people calling and waiving from all directions, smiling and striking out casual conversations. Some people here call the area a dump, still for me it was a valuable insight in the region recovering from the war. It is the people whom I found most surprising - extremely opened and friendly for a region with a recent history like that. Its definitely a place with its own beauty and scenarios and offers a unique experience. If you are the total explorer open to new experiences and ready to taste the true flavors of the places you visit its indeed a pleasurable trip. But if you are fussy about food and accommodation Mannar may not really be your place. You do not have much choice of food restaurants or accommodation but the food definitely has a flavor of its own. Its probably the only city where you get Goats, Donkeys, Cattle and Humans living in harmony. The donkeys are adorable and harmless. If you are looking to get away from your city life and wanting a break with a totally different experience its your place for sure Except the old Fort lots of birds and the funny Baobab tree (looks like wider than tall)in town and mangy wild donkeys there is absolutely nothing of interest here! Beaches could be nice but you can see and feel the closeness to India because all of tthem look like a plastic dump - absolutely horrible! mannar island is totally amazing. The best time to go is during december as the weather is good. Good for bird watching There is little on the island itself that would interest the casual tourist. However, if you know any local folks, then Mannar is a wonderful relaxing place to visit. Interestingly, the place is loaded with donkeys, which were introduced by the Portuguese. But this in itself isn't enough to make a special trip. Mannar town itself is a sleepy little place, and there isn't anything of interest for the casual tourist. If you are going to visit the shrine at Madhu, then I would suggest spending the night in Mannar; it's fairly close, and has the best accommodations in the District. I would also suggest one night in Mannar if you are driving the coastal road to Jaffna in order to break the trip up. Mannar is a beautiful place. There aren’t many places in Sri Lanka that you get to see donkeys freely roaming around like cattle in the rest of the island.  Perfect place to spot birds. We stopped at the bird sanctuary just at the entrance to the island and spotted variety of birds.  In season, I am sure Mannar must be a bird watches paradise. The place is rapidly changing after many years of civil conflict. The blown up bridge alongside the new bridge is reminder of the dark history of the island. The place is now very safe and the people are very helpful. The beaches are beautiful and plenty of shells that are not commonly found elsewhere. The place has basic facilities but there are no super markets. Recommend carrying adequate water and a full tank of fuel. Power shortages are common so recommend carrying a torch and staying in a hotel with a generator. I visited this place after 40 years, lots of changes. This island is connected by road with the main island, there is enough transport to Colombo and other major cities, I saw the railway road is under construction and I am told it will be completed within few months. (most parts of the road is completed) This city (island is famous among Hindus and Catholic because of Madhu St. Marys chursh and Thiruketheeswaram (a very ancient popular Sivan Temple). both are not in the city but little away with good public transport connection. In the city there is a huge tree which you MUST see this is the largest tree in Asia (huge trunk). Aprt from this you can go to Thalai Mannar pier which is about 45 minutes drive this is a historical place which was the landing port from (South India) Rameswaram. Old train road and the pier still there.(Please check with Navy who is in the town whether you can visit because some days it is closed by them) Mannar is getting busy these days, another city in SriLanka. You do see lots of wild Donkeys in this area be careful, they can kick and harm you (not always but there are several incidents) It is fun to watch them, some times they stand still all of a sudden they run or scream, real fun. There are few places to stay Sorry, I did not stay there so no comment. In short it is a dry but charming place. This is one of the best cities I have ever visited in Sri Lanka. However accommodation options were less, unless you're fine with guesthouses. There're so many things to see in this lovely city. We set out from Colombo & took a short cut via the Oyamaduwa road which bypassed Medawachchiya & saved us about 45 minutes drive time. First we visited the Kunchikulam Suspension Bridge en route to Mannar. This was one of the hidden gems which is still standing strong. However the road leading upto the bridge was a bit damaged. Afterwards we proceeded to Thiruketishwaram Kovil & Madhu Church. Both very beautiful sites. Spent the night in a nice clean guesthouse which was well worth the money we paid. The next day morning we visited Talaimannar & took a boat trip to Adam's Bridge. This is another breathtaking experience. The Sri Lankan Navy operates this & if the Ocean is rough, they will not operate. Luckily it was a good day. In the afternoon we visited Arippu Fort which was a Dutch built Fort to which Robert Knox fled while escaping from the Kandyan King during ancient times. Close to the fort is the Dorric House which was the bungalow of the 1st British Governor of Sri Lanka - Fredrick North. Better hurry since this site is at the edge of a cliff & parts of it is being washed to the Ocean. After several years, the entire site will be gone. The road to Arripu from Mannar was a bit bumpy. Spent the night at our cozy guesthouse. Next day morning visited the Vankalai Bird Sanctuary which was a major success for us. I'm not that much into birds, but still I enjoyed seeing so many different birds at that time of the day. In the afternoon we visited the Mannar fort & proceeded back to Colombo. I have never heard of Mannar being mentioned as a travel option among my friends, but I will recommend it in future as a must visit. The two famed places of worship on the A14, the beautiful island of Mannar and its beaches and the amazing Adam's bridge, add the Palmyrah House to that - great! Mannar Island is in the north west of Sri Lanka, a six to seven hour drive from Colombo on good roads. A new road and railway  line are under construction and could reduce the travelling time -- but six/ seven hours , with a couple of rest stops , was not a problem and we arrived at our destination in great shape. Our group of nine spent two days here, relaxing and exploring. Mannar has much to offer -- it is off the beaten track so there are no crowds and this is a great plus point ( let's hope it stays that way ). Great beaches, bird watching during the winter bird migration, sea food, gorgeous sunsets , a boat trip to the Adam's Bridge causeway are a few of the things you could do here. Madhu Church ( one of Sri Lanka's most important Catholic pilgrimage sites ) is just half an hour away. Accommodation is limited at the moment -- but there are some surprisingly good options.  We stayed at The Palmyrah House, which is a perfect little five bedroom boutique hotel. We loved it and plan to return soon. We visited Mannar over the weekend and it is a paradise for bird watchers. We saw migrant birds  Greater Flamingos more than 1000, black tail godwits, Gargneys, Pintail ducks, Gulls, Plovers, terns all in flocks of several hundreds. So many raptors, white bellied sea eagles, brahamin kites, black kites, common kestrels and one booted eagle seen. In addition crab plovers more than 100 and pied avocet around 50 were spotted. For one day we have seen more than 1000 birds. It was really a paradise for bird watchers.",4.0,108,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/12/1f/9b/90/mannar-island-gold-sand.jpg?w=700&h=400&s=1,0.0,21.875,6.25,1.0416666666666663,30.20833333333333,40.625
Mawella Beach,"Mawella Beach. Mawella Beach, near Tangalle in southern Sri Lanka, is a calm and scenic stretch of coastline known for its golden sand and gentle waves. Lined with palm trees and small fishing boats, it offers a peaceful atmosphere away from crowds. The shallow waters are ideal for swimming, while the surrounding village life gives visitors an authentic coastal experience. In reality, the beach is not so beautiful and quite narrow at high tide, no people there, no hotel, secluded spot for those who want a beach to themselves... Lovely sandy beach which, given it was the middle of September when we were there, we more or less had to ourselves.  The beach is nice fine sand but the sea is toorough for swimming. Great for bodybuilding. Due to the season there were not many restaurants open, Some nice bays/beaches within walking  or tuk tuk distance We have spent here 3 days not even wanting to leave the place (maybe after intensive sightseeing before). The kids and us had great time swimming in the crystal clear ocean, jumping in the waves and observing crabs in the evenings. An ideal spot for a relaxing trip. Body boarding and surfing is possible around the bay area. Only a couple of hotels and restaurants are available. Ideal for tourists who would want a quiet and peaceful environment to relax. The local fishing community is also located in the bay if you would wish to speak to them and gain experience. My family and I (3 adults, 4 children ages 7, 6, 3, &1) stayed at a private villa located directly on the west side of this beach.  This is a long beach that is pretty much only used by local fishermen.  Not built up at all and we maybe saw two other tourist couples during our 5 day stay.  The beach is clean and a sand bottom.  The waves were great for our kids and all three older ones played in them.  We were able to surf and ride some waves as well.  This beach is a prime example of the beauty of the far south of Sri Lanka as it is very local (in a good way) and unspoiled.  For reference, we visited in March and sea condition was very good for swimming.  Great place for a sunrise. By far the best beach I have ever seen, beautiful soft sand, clear blue sea, but a bit to rough to swim in but ok to paddle, very quiet but sunsets to die for. Great place to be. Reasonably priced, with a few cosy bungalows, a pool and some sunbeds at guests' disposal. Very friendly and helpful staff, that can arrange anything you need. And what's most important, kilometres of calm, quiet, almost empty, wide and clean beach. A couple of small local restaurants (including one in the resort) are there for a nice Sri-Lankan lunch and dinner - there is always something to choose from. This is a quiet beach that has great swimming. Maxwell has a lovely pool and you can watch the waves from your balcony. It is a little tired but the price reflects that. Next door is a slick but soulless posh hotel that does have the character of the little Santa houses Freshly caught seafood cooked with Love and served with a Smile :) Shahani and Sanjeevani the 2 sisters do an awesome job of keeping the restaurant Alive :) 200% recommended...Can't wait to go back there myself 👌 Did some boogie boarding with the kids and helped some fishermen push their boats out. Very nice. No food options here though. made a surprise visit to Mawella and was pleasantly surprised. elegantly designed rooms overlooking a beutifully landscaped garden, so it offers space as much as it has an almost private beach on the south coast. rooms are designed beautifull by ""Taru"" the owner who has a passion for creating novel interiors. staff and service is good. This beach left in me deep impression. It is so beatiful, so untouched and there are almost no people. All around Tangalle are pretty high waves, but here you can find also safe part, where the waves are not that gangerous. If you are in Tangalle, you must go here! Fantastic get-away-from-it all beach.  Very limited sunbeds.. by beach shacks or dragged onto beach from accommodation.. Advertised as safe swimming, but be careful as undertow strong on occasions  and our hotel had a guide as to 'what to do in a riptide!'. A few small hotels have gardens right onto the beach. A couple of good beach shacks selling excellent fish (you can place your order earlier in day and discuss how you want fish cooked... so we got more fish in our curry than traditional Sri Lankan dishes). Take a torch for evening meal. Some of the hotels did not welcome' outside guests' in for meals or refreshments. Slight issue with dogs, but they bark at everyone  (not as suggested by jogger below!) and their fighting amongst themselves was a bit ferocious at times. Other than that, just a few  birds, monkeys, fishermen and the occasional stray tourist to keep you company. This is basically a local beach.Not many people. A  beach for people who like privacy.No beach facilities. Not many people on the beach, some nice fisherman's boat but no facility for a beach bed or anything like that. Please note that there is a small seafood ""restaurant "" a little cabana owned by fisherman's and their family. Maybe the best fish we ever had ! Don't miss it !! It's the fresh fish we saw them bringing back on their boats . just delicious ! A beautiful 2 kilometre stretch of beach. This is a very beautiful beach. We stayed at villa Mawella for 9 nights and strolled along the beach 3 times a day. the local fishing boats are dotted along the shore, the sand is nice and firm to walk along, the Indian ocean is ridiculously beautiful and warm. You may see 10 people in total as you walk along the beach and half of those will be locals fixing their nets and tending to their boats. Magical place and after 9 days if we were any more relaxed we would be dead! We stayed in a private house along Mawella Beach last week.  It is small, private and not touristy at all. I  attempted a morning jog along the beach however a small group of dogs, which I  never saw again, seemed upset at a white person running and they were persistent. Each day the fisherman wanted a hand bringing their boats in and you are rewarded with a few of their catches which was lovely. On our last night we gave our cook the night off and they recommended we go to Mawella Beach Resort for dinner,  this was a huge mistake,  no one was staying at the restaurant and we were the only people eating there so the options were chicken or fish for dinner. The meals took 1 & 1/2 hours to arrive and one of the pieces of chicken was raw (we were not charged for this). The  large mixed salad was simply an oval plate piled with sliced cucumber, a few slices of tomato,  a handful of grated carrot and cabbage in the middle, and it was more than twice the price of the main meals. We were very disappointed in our meals there. Mawella Beach is wonderful but I wouldn't recommend eating at Mawella Beach Resort restaurant. We arrived middle in the day and as soon we saw the place decided to stay for 3 nights. The owner of the place very helpful and the staff were friendly. They got small pool and beach is out of season to swim but we had great fun with playing in waves. Cannot say food is excellent but when I compare with street restaurant it was really good. Food potions are very big. It was happy time Loved it. Sea fun but strong waves, nice to play in. Bit of an undercurrent. Just a few people, fishermen, cows. Total relaxation. Watch out for sandflies in the afternoon This beach seems to have flown below the radar - at least a kilometer long but no one there except for the fishermen and occasional cow. Firm sand underfoot, no steep drop off and great body surfing. This is, undoubtedly, one of the most beautiful beaches in the area. Not any tourists still, so you can relax in peace and quiet and enjoy the sea, the sand and the atmosphere.  We stayed in the Mawella beach resort for 1 night whilst waiting to go to our chosen guest house due to arriving earlier than planned and were initially pleased with price, location and the little garden chalets.  This all changed with the absolutely frightful staff!!  One young waiter was lovely...the three other men around the restaurand and lobby area were another matter completely. One was patrolling the garden with a big stick, looking for dogs...he seemed amazed that we were angry at his  behaviour towards animals (thought Buddhists were opposed to cruelty???), the other two seemed eager to get rid of us ASAP, turned the lights off and hovered around looking at their watches...at 10pm and whilst we were having our after dinner drinks.  We will NOT be going back!! It is a bit outside Tangalle but definitely worth the cycle or tuk tuk ride. This was my favourite beach in Tangalle. lovely beach within a village community so lots of working fish boats adding a sense of authenticity however the beach is quite off the main road and you need transport ( buses  are frequent  to get to either tangalle town or dickwella if you want to potter about which I like doing",4.3,46,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0a/25/63/e6/mawwella-beach-shore.jpg?w=700&h=400&s=1,0.0,25.0,16.666666666666664,4.166666666666666,25.0,29.166666666666668

Naguleswaram Temple,"Naguleswaram Temple. Keerimalai Naguleswaram Temple is an ancient and sacred Hindu temple in Jaffna, famous for its holy water springs, believed to have healing powers. Devotees visit to pray for health, prosperity, and spiritual well-being. Naguleswaram temple of Kankesanthurai was restored during the reign of Prince Vijaya of Vanga (543-505 BCE). One of the oldest shrines of the region, it is the northernmost shrine on the island of the Pancha Ishwarams of Lord Siva, venerated by Sri Lankan Tamil Hindus around the world from classical antiquity Plan your trip so that you reach the temple only after 9 a.m. The priest of the temple does reach only then and opens the sanctum sanctorum.  Presiding deity is Lorde Shiva. This place is about 30 minutes drive from Jaffna by car. There are frequent buses from Jaffna too. There is only one shop selling pooja items and that too is located inside the temple compound. There is a scared pond close by. So do visit that too. You can spend about an hour here. On normal days the priest comes only after 9 am. So take your time in reaching there.  You can reach this place in 30 minutes from Jaffna by car. There are lot of public transport - buses from Jaffna, too. From KKS it is hardly 10 minutes though public transport might be less frequent on this route. it is a serene place. There is only one shop , that too within the compound of the temple, to buy pooja items.  Not more than an hour is needed in the temple. There is sacred pond very close by. Do visit that too. One of the oldest temples in Sri Lanka that is said to date back to 520 BCE. It was sad to hear that this piece of history was also affected during the civil war. Massive in size and height, Naguleswaran Temple is one of the great temples of Jaffna which leaves you spellbound with its beauty and religious atmosphere. This is a colourful Hindu kovil. The architecture is beautiful. This is next to the Keerimalai tank. Seventeen of us travelling together visited Naguleswaram Temple on 7th July 2019, accompanied by our guide. There is no entrance fee. We first visited the Keeramalai Ponds, and then the temple located close by - almost opposite the ponds. It is a sacred Hindu temple venerated and worshipped from ancient times. The temple had sadly been destroyed badly in 1990 during the civil war.  It was reopened after reconstruction only in February 2012.  The old temple entrance and some of the damaged can still be seen. Being a sacred place, we were careful to dress modestly.  Visitors are required to remove footwear (socks ok) and maintain appropriate decorum and respect.  Males remove their shirts and enter the temple bare bodied to display respect.  Although I am not a Hindu, in accordance with the tradition I purchased and made some offerings though it is not an absolute requirement.  Hindus believe that their offerings to the deities would bring them blessings and aid them in fulfilling their wishes and needs. We circulated through the temple, enjoying the pious atmosphere and looking at the many and various murals, monuments and statues.  A priest placed a small mark on our forehead blessing us!  I also made it a point to drop a small note into the donation box. Thousands of Hindus from all over the world come here to pray and receive blessings. The Atmosphere was such that I felt I was blessed too!! There is both an old ruined temple and a modern build here.  I think built after the civil war.  The modern temple if fine but not particularly interesting.  The Hot Springs pool is very close and you may want to visit it The temple is adorned with ancient sculptures and is near the disease  curing sea water springs which is believed to be linked to the  bottomless well the depth of which have bee found by SL Navy divers to be 275 ft with many caves running from it and the water at the bottom of the well is fully saline sea water whilst the top is fresh drinkable water. the water to this spring rushes in pure from the temple side which is the shallow side of the sea that surrounds it and escapes to the sea at the sea side end through and anicut. It is said that the temple and spring is pre Rawana era and that Rawana and queen bathed in the springs. Prince Vijaya is supposed to have renovated it about 500 BCE. The temple is not in the best shape but still has many things to offer to the learned. This is a beautiful Hindu temple close to the beach and the holy pool. Separate areas for men and women for Bathing in the pool . It is one of the oldest temples in Sri Lanka and referred to in Yalpana Vaibhava Malai. The temple is believed to be associated with Sage Nakula Muni. Nakula in Sanskrit directly translated in to Keeri and hence the place got the name Keeri malai. The walls are like riots of colours with exotic paintings. The statues around too are superbly impressive. A must see in Sri Lanka especially if you are in the northern parts of the country. the temples are not the same as in India. Men have to take off there shirts and pray and i really donot know why. The temple is not well kept and a young man was the only brahmin available to render prayers and give blessing. i was not very happy about this. It was very peaceful inside and one could mediatate This is in Keerimalai which is about 20 Kms from Jaffna. I had traveled by public transport to this place. While going I took a train to Kanaksenturai railway station and a local bus from there which took about 15 mts from the railway station. There are buses from Keerimalai to Jaffna and it takes more than an hour to reach Jaffna. There is nothing much in this place other than the temple and the holy pond. The pond is more like a swimming pool. It is situated on the sea shore. Near the temple there is no big eatery or hotels. There is a small eatery on the way to the pond and you can get refreshments and snacks there. If you need to offer anything to the god in the temple then it is better to buy it in Jaffna and carry ti with you. You do not get much pooja materials in the shop which is just in the entrance. The temple is very good. Not much crowd was there when I visited and I visited on a Poya day in the evening. you can have a peaceful darshan. There is also an idol ( though a small one) of Sarbewarar in the temple. You can also take the blessings of the Preiest who took the initiative in rebuilding this temple and restoring it to its glorious days. The old temple has been closed. The new one's construction is almost finished. not much crowd on weekdays. One of few eswaran temple in Sri lanka and located in front of the keerimalai sacred water spring. And as per the sign board this is one and only temple in Sri Lanka which used to do offers to died hindus. Please pray and experience your Lord Siva. Before you go there please read all about it. Watch all the old building and think about what happened in time. One of the most important Shivan temple in Sri Lanka. You should take a bath first from the sacred pond then you should attend the pooja at the temple. You can take the morning train from Jaffna station and get down from the Mavattipuram station. From there you can take a tree wheeler which costs 250-300 rupees It is an old kovil, which had been destroyed. Reconstruction of the kovil is underway. It is purely a religious place but you could check out peacocks and a giant cow at the backyard of the kovil, who are given foster care at this place. This ruins is right next to Keerimalai Springs - which enables one to see two sites. The ruins are surrounded by a gate and the only sign was inside the ruins. Would rate this higher, but there were no markers or identifying information. Next door is a very large brand new temple. It is still surrounded by scaffolding and no paint has been applied yet. We did not venture inside, rather we observed the temple hustle from afar (so as not to disturb anyone). Just down the road is the freshwater spring. Interesting to see, but appears to just be a pool for locals (one for men and one for women). very historical temple been open to public recently. one of the oldest temple in jaffna itself. dip in the natural springs is a must. One of the oldest Shiva temple in Sri Lanka and the most important one for the Hindus in Jaffna. Special 1008 lingam which is a common feature in India, is available in this holy temple. Construction work is going on, so looks dusty and unclean at the frontal area but spiritual lovers gather here for meditation or for yoga practices. Not much else in the temple. The scenery is ok, but the architecture is average. Unless you are on a pilgrimage, there is not much on offer. As I walked in to this Kovil, I felt an amazing, strong spiritual energy. It doesn't have the glamour of Nallur, but everybody in our group felt the centuries of collective spritual sense. As we were among the first visitors for the day we were able to hear the history of the kovil and information about the priest from the person who looks after the temple and were able to offer a pooja. It is a bit out of the was to get to, but for us the spirituality we felt was worth the visit. This temple has a lot of history, Hindus &  Buddhists all worship here, the place  is still being renovated. Be cautious to dress appropriately as a mark of respect to Hinduism. A beautiful ancient temple now undergoing serious refurbishment. The old granite carvings are beautiful well worth a visit. It is good to visit Naguleswaram temple in your Jaffna visit and experience the hindu customs and beliefs . it is huge temple build in old ages. you have to remove your shirt before entering to the temple. It is not bad, but overall - quite boring, and less impressive than other temples. If you have a choice - rather pick another Hindu temple to visit. SriLanka is full of temples and the people also worship sincerely. This is one of the oldest temple of the island city This is situated very close to Kankesanturai railway station(The last station in the North of SriLanka) From Jaffna it is about 17 KM,KKS roads were very well done you can reach less than 30 Minutes there are ample public transport available and it is very cheap. This is a religious place where Hindus belies this is a place where you can get rid of your sins. This was there from time immemorial and destroyed by invaders and locals on several occasions at present it is under re construction. IT is a cool and calm place to meditate and worship the God in peace. There is no entry fee if you wish you can donate (no compulsion) Usual rules to be followed no foot wear gents to enter without shirt and the ladies with moderate dress no mini skirts and shorts are permitted. If you visit here you must go the Hot springs also which is at few metres distance. If you are a Hindu I think it is a must visit others can have a different experience. It's sad that the old building are being destroyed and replaced by a spanking new construction... but I guess, if its a 'live' temple, then devotees must prefer a newer version... The temple is under repairs at the moment. Very interesting place to visit which have a long history connected to Keeramalai pond. The majestic sacred bull of the temple should not be missed. This is, like many other Hindu temples, overloading of the sight, and smell senses.   Taking off of the shirt, for the blokes, tends to single out we pale Aussies, but the taking off of the shoes from the car park, several hundred metres to and around the temple is a bit of a test for our soft feet.  Then the walk to the Kerimale pools was well worth the extra strain on the feet.  Toughen up, I suppose. It’s an ancient hindu temple and has lot of stories. Nowadays it’s becoming a tourist spot and people are spoiling the tradition of the temple. The “Theertha keni” is used by the people like a swimming pool. I would say that people destroyed the spiritual and traditional of the temple and the environment. The Keerimalai Naguleswaram temple is right next to the medicinal spring of Keerimalai (meaning Mongoose-Hill). Folk lore states that the sage Nagula Muni, shrunk by age and austerity while meditating at a cave in Keerimalai was likened to mongeese that frequented the area. The sage bathed in the springs and was cured of his mongoose face. It is one of the oldest shrines of the Peninsula The shrine was destroyed by the Portugese in 1620.  It was in 1894 that the local Tamils rebuilt the temple. In 1983, the temple was occupied by the Army of the Sri Lankan Government. In 1990, the Sri Lankan Air force bombed the temple during the war against Terrorism. In 2012, the reconstruction of the temple had been completed. It is close to the ancient port of Kankesanthurai. One can see the KKS Cement Factory through the jungle on the way. The factory ceased operations in 1990 due to the conflict between the Government and the LTTE Terrorists.",4.2,46,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/18/55/e6/aa/temple-interior.jpg?w=700&h=400&s=1,0.0,11.428571428571429,8.571428571428571,5.714285714285714,40.0,34.285714285714285
Nanu Oya Railway Station,"Nanu Oya Railway Station. The first and second classes are scrambled and it is difficult to ride while watching the schedule on site. Riding on tour has no travel sentiment in a chartered tour vehicle. Reservations are not required for the third class, and you can interact with local people. The old lady across the street had always cared about getting off at the station, and the young woman next door gave us her window seat. With peanuts. On the last day of the itinerary, with no particular plans in Nuwara Eliya, consult the driver and take the 9.10am train from the nearest Nanu Oya to Hatton, almost tea plantation view. Some of them have an altitude. Then we drove to the airport. It was about 30 minutes late on the day, but if you don't have time, you can't. The third-class toilets don't have the courage to use them, but you can endure them for just over an hour. I am from Sri Lanka and work as a Tourist chauffeur guide for many years for many leading Travel agency in Sri Lanka Sunway Holidays pvt Ltd Negambo Esna Holidays Colombo Suffron island Tour Blue This is fascinating stopover for a day, particularly for a railway or tea country enthusiast. The long platforms of the recently refurbished station has the amenities needed and a good 2 hours between train times[ my suggestion is to take the 4am train leaving Kandy and reaching Nanuoya by 1030am, and take the return train Podi Manike that normally reach the Nanuoya station by 1230pm. The 2 hour gap will give a visitor sufficient time to take in the atmosphere of the surrounding .Either side of the track, particulalry in the direction of Parakramapura is lined with some of the best tea growth in the hill country.On the other side You could be witness to two fascinating waterfalls by literally standing over them atop the century old cast iron bridges which themselves are an attraction. With all of them situated very close to station, you might as well find time even for a decent meal before the arrival of Podimenike. We travelled from Nanu-Oya to Demodara which is a 3 hour ride through the mountains, absolutely beautiful. The reason why we didn’t get off at Ella is because we wanted to see the 9 arch bridge from aboard the train rather than walking 2km along the track. Nice station, good toilet facilities. Definitely a vintage train, would absolutely recommend the sightseeing compartment. The ride was pretty smooth and very pretty. There's a huge underhand racket going on at Nanu Oya station for train tickets and this needs to be cleaned up by the Railways or the relevant tourist authorities. My holiday to Sri Lanka was excellent and would have been complete if I got to travel on the 1st Class Observation car for a few stations either from Nanu Oya to Pattipola or Nanu Oya to Thalawakelle. The guy who served me at the station counter (Pramuka) found a seat for me to travel from Nanu Oya to Thalawakelle.  When I went to pay Rs2,000 for the ticket he didn't want to issue the ticket.  Instead he asked me to complete a form where I had to fill the intended travel date, where I wanted to go and my passport details.  He promised to call me that evening before 9.30pm but I never heard back from him.  I needed to know  whether he was able to secure a ticket for me so that I could plan my next day accordingly. Not sure why he didn't want to sell the available ticket to me to travel to Thalawakelle instead.  He initially thought that I was an agent trying to secure a seat.  I then told him that I am a passenger and not an agent. I am very disappointed that I wasn't able to do this train trip.  If I paid black market rates to buy a ticket I could have easily secured a seat. Something needs to be done to clean this mess so that the visitors get a fair chance to enjoy the train journey in Sri Lanka. Sweet little roadway station. Very clean and tidy.  A little chaotic getting tickets for the next train but doable!  Best to check at railway station for train times!  We caught the 11.10am and had 2nd class  u reserved but got a seat.  Fab train journey. Highly recommended.  We paid usual local fare not hyped prices by travel agents! Beware of drunk drivers especially at night,had a terrible experience,where the lkr railway was delayed due to engine overheat later, harrasment by the taxi driver / tuk tuk.They were fully drunk misbehaved with my wife.. There should be awareness that even the station master on hearing us,went by locking his cabin...please ladies be safe if you are planning to reach Nanu oya station at night.. Nanuoya is famous for its railway station of Sri Lanka's railway Hill Country main line and it is the closest railway station to the Nuwara Eliya. You would only visit here if you were catching the train. Nice enough station that was somewhat chaotic when the train arrived I have mixed feelings about this place. On one hand, it looks great. The place has this atmosphere of a historical building, and most of the things, such as timetables, are old and original. But on the other hand, also the quality of whatever service gives an impression that it's very old and not updated. The train that I was taking with my boyfriend had delay 2 hours. Later I have learned that this is normal. We were standing there for 2 hours outside, since the place is totally crowded. The waiting place inside of the building is for people with the tickets for the 1st class only, which we didn't have. At the same time, there are also toilets at the same waiting room. I didn't see anyone checking if the travelers have the 1st class tickets, but then I also didn't get why the station made the waiting room with the toilets only for the 1st class. Like only the 1st class passengers needed to pee. A place you should see and come out from the station to see the nuwaraeliya. From here only you can go for a good view to Ella or towards kandy. Very special to everyone. Closest Railway Station to Nuwara Eliya Town. If you are planing your trip to Nuwara Eliya by Train Nanu Oya is the ideal station to get down. Even though Pattipola and Ambewela stations situated in Nuwara Eliya bound Nanu Oya station is nearest station from Nuwara Eliya town. Around 5-6 Km to Nuwara Eliya. There are local buses runs through this town (Nanu -Oya)  or else you can hire a Tuk from this station. Station located in the Nanu Oya town. There is a eye catching water fall located near this station. If you want to enjoy the experience get the first class tickets. We got 2nd class and it was a disaster. We were standing up most of the trip and there were too much people, because of that the ride was miserable. We want to see world senic train ride so we start it from Nanu oya to Ella in the morning time .but at the morning all seat there book so we  ride at the evening .this station is good spot to move to Nuwara Eliya and also Ella ,enjoy train trip Is there no room for manners during Covid? I tried to purchase two first class tickets and was rudely informed that they didn’t have change for my 5000 lkr note. While I expect this scenario from tuk tuk drivers, I don’t expect it from a train station where I saw at least 50 people waiting for a train. I opted for the second class option which turned out to be okay. But the rude behaviour of the ticket agents was unacceptable. Only to add insult to injury, the platform guy who looked like a cop scolded my friend in Sinhalese to tell me to wear my mask properly. I was later informed that this individual used profanity on my friend. Highly uncalled for. There is no excuse for rudeness such as this. Other than that,the train ride was lovely This train station services nearby Nuwara Eliya. It would not be a complicated thing to buy tickets, signs readily available for the classes of service. An overpass afforded views of incoming trains. It otherwise is functional as a basic train station. Travelling on the train from Kandy was a wanted and anticipated ""experience"" for our Sri Lanka holiday.  The train trip itself was slow and the ride quite rough in places - but quite acceptable for us. Interesting scenery along the way. We travelled 2nd class - reserved. The train toilets were not good - one squat {with no paper} .. and possibly a western toilet in the inexplicably locked room opposite.  But that was not a big upset. But upon arrival at Nanu Oya we were will in need of the station rest rooms and queued with others for the Foreigners Restrooms. However these were quite disgusting!  No running water for the toilet or wash basin. Toilet blocked with paper and faeces and no way to address this.  No handle on the washbasin tap, toilet door would not shut properly. Several indications that these were not new problems. The biggest upset was when we reported this to station staff ( via a local tour guide) .  They stated that they did not accept that there was anything wrong. And clearly they were not going to make any attempt to correct it! This area of Sri Lanka has become a significant tourist drawcard - and this was they way they treated international tourists!  Shame! The station has a special bathroom for foreign tourists. Great idea, but the said bathroom is missing running water or door lock. A very beautiful train journey to Ella from Nanu Oya. Mist, rains, and beautiful greens. My kids enjoyed it thoroughly so did we. A special mention to my tour operator "" My Ceylon Trip, to have arranged the tickets at a very short notice. I tried three days to get Ella ticket from here but they don’t have tickets for first class at all. In second class you may not get the seats. I took the reverse route and I went to Ella and travelled back to Nanu Oya to enjoy that dream train journey: This is the station from where the most famous train leaves with a destination to Ella. The train is a simple one with no jing-bang to talk about. As our travel agent did not brief us properly, we were dropped at the station just in time. When the train arrived, we hustled ourselves in a crowded coach and stood for almost 2 hours from the overall 2.5 hrs of the journey. No ventilation. No proper fans. Seeing the mountain views were definitely not helping us change our mood. There is a reserved coach in the train, which I saw on de-boarding the train. Either ways, the views were not at all something that we couldn't get elsewhere in SL or even in India. Remember, that from Nuwara to Kandy - it is a road-ride through awesome tea plantations. Do not waste time and money here. The train ride is over-rated and not as scenic as advertised. There's really nothing much to be seen except tea plantations (which is almost everywhere, nothing significant or Instagram worthy). The train station dated back to British times and was extremely run down with worn out timber sleepers. I am not sure how safe the trains will be. Inside the platform 'cafe' was a plaque which stated that the catering service was taken over on 1st Jan 1969. The trains ran on diesel and equally ill-maintained. The first class cabin had a distinct smell and 'flavour'. I would say its first class till the early 70s, its no different from 3rd class cabin now. Save your money and hire a van or car. There was nothing worth taking photos of, well perhaps the back of the seat... Following are the train fares to Nanu Oya railway station from Kandy railway station: Inter-City Exp [1st Class AC – Reserved] – LKR 500 Inter-City Exp [2nd Class – Reserved] – LKR 350 Inter-City Exp [2nd Class – Unreserved] – LKR 160 Inter-City Exp [3rd Class – Unreserved] – LKR 90 The 7 hour long train ride from Kandy to Ella is said to be the most beautiful train ride in the world and I wouldn’t disagree. Our red train went through mountains, villages, beautiful tea estates and the longest tunnels that I’ve seen so far. While locals and tea pluckers smiled and waved at passengers from the passing train to wish them a happy journey, passengers cheering together everytime the train entered a tunnel made the ride even more entertaining. Striking this off my bucket list. Note: The trains are packed and it’s difficult to get a window seat, you might even have to stand for hours before you get one. Srilankan most famous train 🚞 leaves from Nanu Oya station (Nuwara Elya, heart of the Tea Country) with destination  Ella (and farther). May I also share my impressions with you, after the 3h30 journey ? a) despite what you are going to read on travel magazines articles/blogs, the whole ride on train is as scenic as any other through mountain landscapes. I think it's a bit overrated and that won't impress you so much. b) as an alternative, and in order to experience exclusively the best part of it, I would opt for the very short ""Demodara loop"" (6 kms long; cost of the ticket 10 LKR = ~0,05€). So catch the train directly in Ella, take a seat on the left side of the carriage/coach and get off at the next station (Demodara itself). You will enjoy the view passing on the NineArchBridge, while being greeted by hundreds of persons too. 😊 For the best train journeys in Sri Lanka. It is an old station, nothing flash, however, ticks the boxes, has a waiting room for foreigners, with nice (couches) seating and clean washrooms/toilets. Ella to Nanu oya (3hrs) Then lunch at Nuwara eliya and visit a Tea Plantation en route to Kandy. Amazing train journey from Ella to Nanu Oya. Best to go in the second class compartment where you can peak out of the carriage doors to take some amazing photos of the train. You get vendors on the train selling hot roasted peanuts coated in salt and chilli - these are amazing. You also get fried snacks made of lentils which were superb. There is only one place to lunch in Nuwara Eliya and that’s Salmiya’s Italian Restuarant. It’s a small cafe tucked up a side road. Best pizzas ever. Really thin crust. Salmiya is an amazing host. Thank you for feeding all 24 of us. Salmiya did not even panic when we all turned up - took our orders and started rolling pizza dough. Her two assistants did all the chopping of fresh vegetables and herbs / washing plates etc - thank you to them too. I felt very sorry for the several back packers who arrived just after we placed our order as they would have had a very long wait! Then onwards to Kandy on the coach. A place you should see and come out from the station to see the nuwaraeliya. From here only you can go for a good view to Ella or towards kandy. Very special to everyone. As soon as the train arrived, I started to ask myself why would we do this ? The train was 1h30min late, when it stopped, people inside can’t even get off, it was crowded as hell. we got pushed onto the train, I can barely put both of my feet on the deck, and it smelled so bad, gross *100. It is supposed to be a two hour ride, which turned out to be 3 and half, there are no seats, you can imagine the rest.... Personally the whole situation just make it so difficult to really enjoy the view, even thought it is truly pretty. Would not do it again. will not recommend to anyone who are with kids. We enjoyed the scenic train from Nanu Oya to Ella for the view. We had first class tickets but were disappointed that couples and families spread themselves over the cabin so they could get as many window seats as possible and then proceeded to go to sleep. Quite selfish but that's some people. Everything was quite rustic from the train carriages to the late time the train arrived. It may be charming but the state of the public toilets weren't. If you have a mobility issue I don't recommend the train. There are many tourists struggling to get into the train. It is sad to say SLR is doing nothing to uplift standards of trains. The Minister of transport must be sleeping don't know the real ground situation. Why the railway authorities can't add few more carriage. Our driver dropped us off at the station 30 minutes prior to the scheduled departure of the train to Ella.  We had attempted to purchase 1st class tickets but were told that those were sold out.  Only 3rd class tickets were left. The small drop-off area can only accommodate temporary parking.  You walk into the building to purchase the train tickets, then walk over to the correct platform.  One western toilet inside the ""Foreigners Lounge"" was located on one end of the platform.  As usual, bring your own toilet paper and hand wipes.  The other restrooms were for ""2nd class and 3rd class"" ticketholders. One side of the station is adjacent to a mountain, the other side has views of the tea plantations and farms.  Make sure you get on the trains quickly as there is a mad scramble to get seats since there are no assigned seats if you are not in first class. An interesting journey in the observation car to Ella had us going backwards and we could see far more than if we were going forward. Some interesting points along the way but not one of the great railway journeys of the world. A very rural railway. Very nice and clean trau station, walking venders sell you everything you need, the toilet is hiding in the restrooms. Nanu Oya station is mostly known because it is at one end of the Nuwara Eliya - Ella, marginally interesting touristic train ride. The station itself is quite dirty and has nothing notable to offer except for a few stray dogs hanging around. a good place to visit, more travellers visit this place, all ways  trains are there, very cool misty place, you can walk around the station and shoot photos, a beautiful place. and you can travell by old good trains. You didn't visit Srilanka unless you have tried the ride to Ella by train, even tho we had a driver all the time, we went by train to experience the ride between tea plantation mountain and the no ending green valley. you can find the best view in all srilanka, hills mountains big valley, green is all over the place, a 2 hour ride that will take you breath away. Ask the guy who check your tickets to open the doors of the train so you can get a better view. The train ride from Nanu Oya to Ella took around 3 hours and the train does not strictly follow the timetable. On our day there was a 45 minutes delay, which could post some issue if nature called as the station had only 1 functional toilet for foreigners, which as one could imagine the long queue in front. There are toilets for local if one could accept. The journey was quite scenic with the landscapes of tea plantation, cloud forests, and small towns and stations in between. We booked the first class cabin to secure the seats but this was by no means the luxury version. Though the cabin was air-conditioned but the best seats would be the open entrances, having direct views and better photo opportunities. However they were already occupied by fellow passengers from the start. We would not consider the train ride to be romantic as in other rides in the world but this is one unique experience in Sri Lanka with its natural beauties on display abundantly. Nanu Oya is a village in Sri Lanka, named after the Nanu Oya river. It is located within Nuwara Eliya District in the Central Province and is situated approximately 8 km away from Nuwara Eliya Als long als everyone says that you have to make the trainride Kandy to Ella, everyone will make it. We can absolutely not recommend this trainride. Sometimes in fact the views are nice, but never stunning. Go to Austria or Switzerland and you have the views you want to see. Than about the guard at the train, what a nasty guy. Sits alone in his huge compartment and in the meanwhile he is trying to get as much people in the train as possible standing shoulder to shoulder. Asking him to put people in his compartment is not the question, he wants to answer. He wants to stay alone in his compartment. Fire this wistle blowing idiot! Please do not go with this train in the high season, because you will be stacked in the train and see nothing of the views (that are not great, but nice), unless you have reserved seats in the first class. When you want to go in the high season and you have go second or third class, don't go by this train. From Nanu Oya (closest station to Nuwara Eliya) to Ella the train ride takes approx. 2.5-3 hours. The scenery is as amazing as you probably have already read everywhere else. They weren’t lying. Every new turn will take your breath away. We took the 3pm from Nanu Oya and the train was not crowded at all. Unlike what we have anxiously anticipated there was no commotion during boarding and the train ride itself was calm and enjoyable. Our tickets were booked in advance via a local guide and we had both Air-conditioned first class and second-class reserved. Will definitely recommend the second class reserved option because you get wide open windows and doors (it didn’t rain during our journey). First class was filled with big families with small children so it was way busier and the AC was at a wishy-washy temperature. The train was not packed at all but during booking we were constantly being reminded tickets were selling out fast. So to avoid disappointment buy tickets in advance, we saw quite a few tourists being brought to the station by their guide just to buy tickets and leave. Will recommend this magical ride to everyone. We went here only because we managed to get train tickets (3rd class) to Ella and the experience was amazing. The station itself was ok. We didn’t experience any issue with anyone. It was very quiet outside the station and on the platform waiting for the train there were many school kids laughing and asking us for sweets. Even the stray dogs were friendly. Facilities were good with a foreigner waiting room and a restaurant blasting out Indian music which was fun. The train was late but it’s wasn’t a problem as we weren’t in a rush. I would recommend (if you can get tickets) starting your journey from Nanu Oya as from the start of the journey the train goes through some wonderful tea plantation areas. If you go third class (also second class) the windows and doors are open so you get to really experience the outside in and you can take the iconic train photo when the train rolls around the hillside. Magical!!! Also third class was clean, comfortable and at least when we went empty so it was such an enjoyable experience. Nanu Oya Railway Station is the nearest last stop railway station to Nuwara Eliya. So it is advisable for the foreign travelers who are on budget trip to Nuwara Eliya should be aware of the people (Guides & Tuk Tuk Drivers) on your arrival at the station. after passing the ticket counter there are several guides and Tuk Tuk drivers try to give you offers for the hotel reservations and transport to Nuwara Eliya. Most likely you will get disappointment if you accept there offers because most of them provide unclean and unfair hotels. They'll keep following you until you reach the main road which is approxiamtely 100m from the station. So it is best to take Tuk Tuk parked next to the main road. however they'll charge double for the foreign tourists but it is much cheaper than the Tuk Tuk guys parked next to the station. But the better option is to travel by bus from Nanu Oya to Nuwara Eliya for much cheaper. It's better if you ask people out there from bus time and the bus stop. Most of them will try to change your mind to take Tuk Tuk to Nuwara Eliya. Never seek any guide from Tuk Tuk guys. It's better if you ask from any Pedestrians out there. Learning to Bargain is too a great experience if you try. Some guides or Tuk Tuk Guys will try to overcharge after all the services are done. If they do so warn them that you are going to call the police. Then they will leave after swearing some beautiful words at you. If they don't, just call the police and inform them. This is an important Railway station as it carries travellers to all the prominent hill country towns.    The Station has now been modernised and is worth a visit to admire the surroundings and also to take a ride in the local train.   It also has a Kiosk for hot drinks and tasty local bites",3.5,53,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/16/c0/ad/61/an-iron-bridge-and-a.jpg?w=700&h=400&s=1,0.0,24.444444444444443,4.444444444444445,8.88888888888889,20.0,42.22222222222222
Pedro Tea Factory,"Pedro Tea Factory. There are nice views of the tea plantation but they can be had for free from the side of any road in the region. Our half hour 200 rupee pp tour took about 10 minutes and our guide clearly didn’t want to be there. I also found the tea at the end to be weak. Not a highlight for the trip. We were looking forward to seeing a working tea factory in action, learn about tea and enjoy a tasting to understand different varieties and qualities of tea. None of this actually happened as we were shown around an empty tea factory looking at machines and being told the absolute minimum by a bored and annoyed guide. After the tour we were given a cup of tea and encouraged to buy tea from the shop. Far too commercialise. If you want to learn about tea and enjoy a tea tasting go somewhere else, this was totally not worth the time or energy. I was a bit disturbed that they call these factories plus staff housing ""estates"" when in reality its modem plantations. Please ask your guide for more info... they don't hide information about the setup of these ""estates"". All staff seem happy and at peace, grateful even, for the accommodations and the work. Please take the factory tour - very informative - from start to finish. You learn the entire tea process. The best part is learning how tea ""tasters"" from all over Sri Lanka have such a delicate palate they can identify any tea from any region by taste and smell. I love the sustainability museum at the end of the tour. It's nice to see that such hard work and production is done with the environment in mind. Unfortunately the weather wasn't the best on the day. The gentleman who gave the tour seemed very passionate about the place, and provided some interesting facts. Not sure that I would have come here if I wasn't on a group tour, knowing the living and work  conditions of tea plantation tea pickers.  Though this place had many posters stating how they house and help their workers. We really enjoyed the tour of this working factory. We did not appreciate the hard manual work required for tea picking and sorting thereafter. We have all resolved that we MUST pay more for our tea as the tea pickers don’t get paid enough- it seems less than US$10 per day. Shocking! Of all the tea factories, this one felt most genuine, not a tourist trap at all! Totally recommended, interesting overview of a tea factory's ins and outs, set to a beautiful view, with a lovely cup of tea as a finale! We were staying overnight in Nuwara Eliya and borrowed bikes to visit the Pedro tea factory. The ride up the hillside was tough but it was so beautiful to cycle the paths through the plantation we didn't mind. The tour itself lasts about 30 minutes and the smell of the fresh tea is intoxicating in the drying room. Our guide spoke perfect English and was happy to answer questions. After the tour we tasted some of the tea, which was delicious! Definitely worth a visit if you have a free morning. Had a nice 20 minute tour round the factory (note: machinery operates only at night). The tea house could do with having a larger outside terrace to enjoy the plantation views whilst sampling the different teas. Also had a wander through the plantation for some good photo ops with/of the tea pickers. Unfortunately our guide seemed really uninterested in showing us around and answering our questions. She did not even paid attention to us. Would not recommend! Excursions to the factory goes every half an hour. (Till 16.30, as I remember) If you want to see working machines, you need to come in early mornings (may be not all days) But it’s not necessary to see  exactly working process. It’s interesting anyway. Guides speaks English, so all information is understandable. You could see old machines and know many interesting facts about tea manufacture. The smell of tea is amazing. And also you could walk among tea trees on tea plantations behind the factory. It’s very beautiful. You could see the process of picking tea leaves into special baskets. Working women could show you tea leaves and you could taste it. So also they suggest you to take a photo with them, but they also wants you to pay for photos. And it’s strange. Also you could but very good tea in a factory shop. In the shop you could ask about process of brewing tea. It’s a good gift. We spent a couple of hours at the pedro tea factory We were guided by loshini who was very good at answering our questions and translated the information about how tea leaves were processed in english and Tamil as well. Highly recommended if you want an informative tour about tea leaves :) You can visit wonderful tea gardens and taste tea. There are short tours in the factory where you can see the tea production step by step, and there is a free tea tasting at the end of the tour. There is also a sales office where you can buy gift tea. Great guide who explained everything clearly and concisely.  Sixpacks of tea seem expensive at 2000 rupees but each pack of tea is 125g  for just under £1.50 so good value really for a class product.  Teaworkers were striking in Nuwara Eliya while we were there.  They want 1000 rupees a day instead of the current 850.  I so hope they get it as it is such a hard life. We visited a number of tea factories and got tired of the hard sell. Pedro tea factory was different. It had a lovely feel. The lady who showed us around was really lovely. There tea is delicious and there was no hard sell at all. Highly recommend It was a Sunday so the factory wasn’t working. We decided not to pay for a tour as we’d already seen one tea factory on a non-production day. They do let you wander the plantation which was nice, although there were no pickers working either. Free tea tasting - just one tea, and a very small shop. If you’re going, go on a production day. Nearby the town and a great place to spend an hour or so during a rainy monsoon morning. Pleasant tea café and beautiful views; interesting to see how tea is processed (but be warned going upstairs is one of the hottest experiences ever -- the warm air from the drying process drifts upwards and literally a bit hard to breathe)! If you're a tea drinker check this establishment out. The tour of the factory by an informative guide is well worth the time and the short trip out of town. The vistas are beautiful, however the shop only sells several packets of tea at a time, so if space in your luggage is limited you'll be disappointed. Entrance costs 1,000 rupees per person, the tour is very short, about 15 minutes, and you can only see the machines themselves but you can't see the creature itself because it only happens at night. There's a feeling that the tour was done in an area only for tours and that they don't show the factory itself. The machines they look very dusty and outdated, really feel like a fake representative. This tour gives a good insight to how tea is manufactured and is located in a very picturesque setting. The tour is not too long at 30 minutes and only costs R250 pp which we felt was reasonable. After a wonderful train trip into the high country this tour did not in any way live up to our expectations. It was a rushed tour with the explanations of the workings of the plantations and the origins of Sri Lankan tea sadly lacking. We were taken around the facility but ended up with no further knowledge than we had arrived with. We were not shown any tea bushes or how they were picked. Sad to say the least as we had looked forward to this part of our journey. A video would have been altogether more enlightening . Was heading for the Lover’s Leap, when I found this tea factory, and thought I’d buy some to bring back home. Tried to ask if it was organic, the women in the tea saloon didn’t understand, so after getting a hold on the manager, I sort of Got an answer: they are “sort of organic” he said - using some chemicals. They do seem to have great focus on social responsibility, like houses for all their workers, which is great. Their lightest tea was the best, in my opinion, but also the BOP. We visited this factory on a Monday and there was no tea production happening so we were taken around the machinery which was not very interesting. Our tour guide spoke on auto pilot and was more interested in waving to her co-workers than in explaining anything to us. We were provided with a cup of tea afterwards but there was no explanation of what tea it was. At RP250 it is not expensive but it’s really not worth the time. We were staying local to Pedro Tea Estate and visited one afternoon. Firstly we were offered free roaming of the tea plantation and walked down to near the lake, then had a complimentary tea & a tour. Hashini was very knowledgeable & explained the process very well. Photos were not allowed inside however the outside was very scenic. At the end, you could buy some of the tea made, which I assume is where revenue comes in. Overall I’d definitely recommend this experience! We went for a tour to this factory. Our guide was a lady that spoke very unclear english. She guided us at a high speed through the production facility where nobody was working. Only during the night there is production. So after the tour we have seen all the machines but still do not know exactly how the production is being done. Afterwards you receive a cup of tea. many varieties of tea and The tour was wonderful  The guide was explained everything nicely also price is cheap Factory tour with the guide was very interesting and informative. They charge a  nominal fee of LKR250 for adults and my kids were allowed without a charge. They run the factory during the night shift only so couldn't see most machines working but despite that one would get a good sense of how tea is produced. We also walk down the tea bushes but didn't see any plucking activity in that part unfortunately. I would recommend this place to people who have not been to a tea factory before. Our guide was friendly and the factory interesting. It did feel like we learnt the rudiments of the process and given we only had a limited time, this worked for us. If you want a more in depth bus-to-cup tour, you'll have to look elsewhere. Went on tour of factory, could hardly understand the guide, nothing happening in the factory. Very little explanation of the picking process or tea varieties, offered a cup of tea at end of visit. I’m sure there are better places to visit. The visit was hasty, the explanation in English difficult to understand from a rather rude companion. It is also the only tea factory and plantation where an entrance fee of 500 rupees is required. At the end you can make purchases in the shop. If you want to visit a plantation there are better solutions in the area, much larger and free. The tour of the production facilities is 500 rupees each which I don't think is unreasonable. It was an informative session and there was no hard sell as mentioned in other reviews. In fact it was a bit of an effort to get a tasting and to buy. Views from the location are lovely and all in all well worth an hour or so. very informative tour and a lovely setting well worth visiting and trying the teas - the tea is for sale also We think it is just another Tea Factory. I too thought the same. I have being to many tea factories in my life. But the Pedro tea factory itself is different. The building structure is unique and as explained by my Friend Nadun Madushan, the Assistant Manager, it is built in the style of an Chocolate Factory. In order to maintain a high standard of quality, tea manufacturing is done only during the night when the weather is colder. Therefore, the action is very low during the day time. But don't be worried there are plenty of staff who are well trained to take you on a guided tour on how tea is manufactured. Due to security reasons the management doesn't allow anyone to take photographs inside the premises. Their tea boutique is also a very cozy place to visit and have a nice cup of tea and purchase whatever the flavor you wish to have. And over looking the tea boutique is the lovely scenery of the tea estate. Time spent here is very relaxing and memorable. This place is a must visit to anyone who visits the beautiful Nuwaraeliya. We had a quick tour and explanation of how tea is made - it was fine but quick. I was most disappointed with the selection of gifts - I didn’t end up buying anything because the selection wasn’t great. The grounds were beautiful though. As I am engaged in the tea sector ,I was much interested about this place but when I tasted the cup of tea I got much dissatisfied as they offered us a cup of tea made of Tea ""DUST"" thats one of the low cost tea which tastes awful and I totally disappointed with this experience. But I must say the view through the tea shop was quite nice  but i went there for tea so if you are looking for great cup of tea ..sorry ,thats would not be the place for such. Great experience. 500LKR/pax for an interesting tour around the tea factory (photos prohibited) and a complimentary cup of tea. 1000LKR/pax to have a practical demo of tea picking, and 15/20 minutes to try it out yourself. 1100LKR/pax for tea tasting. Overall, a cheap and fun afternoon out! Good tour around the factory and good to know the tea process... inside the factory is really dirty and tea spilled all over the place, my wife and kid found it difficult to walk... All tea factories in Sri Lanka is same, we went to tea factory in Lipton seat, this one is also similar to that one, but the free tea they give after tour, is amazing ;) you have to pay 250 rupee per person... One of our highlights to tea country was our trip to Pedro tea factory. The tour was amazing. The process was explained and we saw the machines and every step of tea production our guide was lovely and guided us with expertise and passion I was particularly impressed how they included a man on our tour who had an impairment. They were considerate of his needs and he wasn’t left out. Tea tasting st the end was great and we purchased tea to take home. Highly recommend if you love tea. Non operational in the morning. Opening Hours: 8.30 AM Ticket: LKR 200/- with one cup of tea If you don't want to visit the factory, you can still visit the tea plantation without any charges. You can tip the workers in the plantation if you like. The hike in the fields in amazing. We all had to have a picture of us in our green aprons you have to wear for the tour. The tour was nice - some very old equipment. Interesting how the different teas are made. Nice cup of tea on the deck overlooking a great view. It's easy to join a group to take a tour of this factory. The tour runs really fast, and assumes you already know something about tea and how it is produced. After the tour is over they serve you a cup of tea produced in the area. Chose the Pedro tea factory if you are wanting an authentic experience. Only 200 rupee per person for a guided tour with tea sample at the end. They take you on a short tour of their tea factory and plantation. You have to pay a fee for the tour. You will to taste the tea grown there This is where we purchase our tea from every time we visit Nuwara Eliya. We have visited Pedro tea factory over 5 times now. This was our 7 month old's first time though. The tea is superb and the view of the tea plantations from the viewing deck is a nice experience. We did experience the factory tour once which was very informative. Highly recommended for a nice experience if you enjoy Ceylon Tea. Dreadful tour. Charged 1k rupees to be show around the factory by someone that couldn’t be bothered. The staff were less than impressed that we had chosen their tour above all others. Don’t waste your time, here are many tours to go on and I wish we had picked a different one. Comparatively a small factory built in 1885, yet an interesting tour. Located just 3.5 km from the Nuwaraeliya city center makes its one of the few factories closer to the town. As soon as you enter the premises , it’s start smelling tea. Tickets for the tour is available at the counter in  “Lover’s Leap” Ethical tea boutique. Boutique is located right opposite the car park down  towards the tea estate. Tickets comes with a free cup of tea which is free to enjoy before or after the tour. Boutique's clean and well maintained ambiance was so relaxing and offer a perfect view of the greeny tea estate. There was a fair collection of Ceylon tea to be purchased. However, lesser verities. Didn’t see a large collection of flavoured or infused teas. Reason may be this place only sells the pure tea straight from their factory without any infusions or additions. Only pure tea as it is. “Lover’s Leap”, the Boutique got this name in reference to a nearby waterfall with the same name. Supposedly the name was given after an ancient prince and his lover leapt into death from the particular waterfall. Tour was fairly short since the factory is small (just about 10-15 minutes). But worth the experience. What I loved most is purchasing different kinds of Ceylon tea. If your itinerary is too tight and does not permits much time to travel a factory too far from city or long tea tour, this is an ideal place. It’s a pity that the group sizes are so big. We were shown around by a very sweet lady but unfortunately we couldn’t hear a word she said, due to the noise of the machinery. the gardens are pretty, and it was interesting to look around the factory but overall we felt that they should have more but small tour groups. There are several competing tea factories that are vying to be the top tourist draw of tea country (massive hotels, all the trappings).  This one, while perfectly well set up for tourists, is clearly still mainly in the business of processing tea.  They have a nice reception area, and start you off with a cup of delicious local product.  Then they take you on a very informative tour, on which pictures are inexplicably forbidden (most of the machinery appears to date back to the early industrial revolution, I can't imagine a picture or two would disclose any top secrets but oh well). Guide books say nothing is going on because they do all their processing at night, but I actually saw this as an advantage:  no interference, we could walk around and not get in anyone's way.  Our guide was very knowledgeable.  Strongly recommended!! Paid 250rupees for the tour.. it took about 20min all together.. the lady spoke very fast and rushed the whole process... She also asked whether she could give my change later however she didn't and I forgot about it so I don't know if she does that to everyone for side note to anyone reading this. We got some tea at the end and we didn't even know what kind of tea we we were drinking... The factory was cool inside and that's about it... I guess it's a must do for something to do in Nuwara Eliya. We took a stroll around the tea plantation which was nice and had some sick views of the dam and Mountains. The walk through the tea factory followed by the cup of tea is a wonderful experience. The guides take you around the place which costs LKR 200 (only cash). Your tea comes with the mildest variant that they produce so it's something that you need to keep in mind It's not a big thing, give yourself an hour or two max. But it's a lovely little trip very informative of tea production and cup of tea thrown into the mix for 200 rupees. So can't complain. Visited the Tea factory couple of days back, it was a wonderful experience. The staff is very polite and knowledgeable. They speak  all three languages, property is in a beautiful location. it was indeed a very informative tour and the cup of tea at the end of the tour was a lovely touch. This tea factory offers a tour of key production processes.  It is unfortunate that the factory is not actually operational during the daytime.  Explanations were clear and concise.  Refreshment is available and a small shop selling their products Surrounded by beautiful tea plantations, the Pedro Tea Factory was a great place to visit. We had a lovely friendly tour guide who took us round the factory, although by the time we got there, it wasn't actually in use. Our guide was knowledgeable and explained everything really well, and the tea at the end was a lovely treat! We enjoy drinking tea and had never experienced what goes into growing and processing tea until we visited the Pedro Estate Nuwaraeliya tea factory. Enjoyable day out in very scenic part of Sri Lanka. Very clean and tidy facilities and great cup of tea. About 20 minute drive from city centre. Great drive. Our tour guide Sivakavj at the Banquet Boutique was the perfect guide with excellent knowledge and very friendly customer support. Ask for her personally and you will not be disappointed. The young lady guide was pleasant but the factory tour showed how many manual processes are yet to be automated. The newest machines seemed to be from 1986. As the factory operates between midnight and 0600 hours when the area is at its coolest, all we could watch was a couple of workers separating picked tea leaves as well as others carrying heavy bundles between sites. Some visitors went down a hill to see how an employee picks the leaves.  It needs skill, and constant avoidance of thorns.  Not a job I'd have ever enjoyed, especially given the midday heat. The gift shop was the focus of the estate.  Along with a cup of tea it concluded the experience. We simply turned up and tours were running pretty much all the time (every 15 minutes roughly, each time enough people we waiting for them to run one), it was 200 LKR each (we visited on 16-02-2017) and the tour rook about 20 minutes. After the tour they gave us free tea to try and we went for a walk around the tea gardens. You can buy all the tea they grow there. The tour was in English. Really interesting and informative tour is very workwhile. Explains a lot about the industry how tea is made and the history On arriving we were given a cup of the plantation tea, which was delicious, and we were able to sit out on the balcony overlooking the plantation and enjoy the morning sunshine and lovely views. The tire was interesting although quite short, I would have liked to also have a chance to learn about how they pick the tea and look after the plants (it focuses on the processing of the tea after it is picked). Still very interesting however. It can be hard to hear the guide on the factory of you have a large group. The factory promotes worker welfare and ethical tea practices, there are interesting signboards in the visitor centre about the factory's history and engagement in UN programmes. We had a tour of this tea factopry during our 6 day tour of Sri Lanka. The two, of us were taken round by a very knowledgeable young lady who was able to answer all of our questions. Unfortunately photography isn't allowed inside the factory but I did manage to get one picture which gives you an idea of what it's like I wasn’t really into this, but my lady was and the tuk tuk driver recommended it... you’ll take a 15 minute walk through the factory and see how tea is made... they let you have a tasting and hope you’ll buy something. We were supposed to go to Damro but went here instead as land slides had blocked the road. A very average factory tour: the attendant walked us through the entire tea-manufacturing process in their factory. Nothing spectacular, just an average tour. They didn't have a lot of varieties of tea for sale either. The friendly guides at the tea factory give you a reasonably comprehensive tour of the tea drying and preparation process. You end up with, what else, a nice cup of tea and it was actually one of the nicest cups of tea I've ever had. A good learning experience. Lovely old tea factory in the hills.  we were given a tour of the factory and shown  how the leaves are processed. At the end we got to taste 2 kinds of tea. The tea is brewed for exactly 5 minutes. The tea factory is among a huge tea plantation. They take you on the tour in groups, while waiting for your turn or after the tour you can relish their complimentary tea drink. There is an fee of 200lkr that is charged, so in case you plan on visiting other places in Nuwara Eliya then one of the bigger tea plantations would be a better option since the tours here dont have charges. We were not so impressed with the tour at this factory. First of all the factory was not in action. I guess because it was a Sunday. So you look at a bunch of machines and try to figure out how it works. The tour leader was very hard to hear because of the noise of cleaning the machines. The good thing is that Pedro works in a very friendly way for the environment, fair trade and so on. The tour itself was however not so great. It starts off at about 8.15am, and involves a guided tour of the tea factory itself. This is not a massive tour group; each visiting group is taken on their own tour by a guide, even if the group consists of just 2 people! Literally no waiting time. The tour itself is very interesting, & he guide is knowledgeable and entertains questions asked by guests. After the tour, guests are allowed to roam the tea plantation by themselves! No one breathing down your back or watching your every move... Haha! Total freedom in a lovely tea estate.... finally, the tour ends with a warm cup of Sri Lankan tea. I thoroughly enjoyed this tour...! Not being much of a tea drinker, I found the factory tour interesting and informative.  But what fascinated me more were the tea pickers who worked 8 hours a day with a daily goal of picking 18 kilograms a day, all for less than $5 USD. We went to this on our way to Heritance Tea Factory. Unfortunately it was a Sunday so the factory wasn’t working but we saw a tea factory and got a good explanation of its working. Worth the hour stop. They don’t allow photos. No idea why not. Pedro tea factory is near Nwara Eliya and not too far from Heritance Tea Factory. The guide spoke perfect English and the tour of the working factory very interesting. You can see all phases of tea production. There is a small shop where you can buy their local tea and you can taste it. Nice to see how they made tea, tour is not long but interesting, you can not take pictures inside the building. You can buy tea at the factory Good tour and an interesting insight into how tea is picked and prepared for packaging. Also has great views of the tea estate and a nice place to relax and drink tea (what else) Potential not exploded. Could be amazing, stays on average. Good tea and views at the end. Nothing special. What a pity. The explanation is made while they dont have much going on. Hard to see it in action. Mainly cos they work at night. Hope to come back in the future and see it shining. Pedro Tea Factory is not quite as fancy as others in the area but definitely worth a visit. The staff was friendly and helpful. There is a outside area where you can have a cup of tea and enjoy the beautiful view. During our sri lanka trip we also wanted to visit a tea factory and since our accomodation in nuwara eliya was close to the san pedro facility we went there for a tour around noon. The entrance fee has meanwhile increased to 250 rupees which is still not very high, but the whole tour took also only around 20 minutes and was not very informative. At noon there was no production in the factory that day, however with production in the background we would have probably not understood our tour guide. We got a cup of tea afterwards but also without any further comments or explanation. Seems the quality of the tours in this factory has quite a wide variation. Visited early in the morning as an alternative activity to our trip to Horton Plains being cancelled. They were extremely helpful, despite the electricity being off, they managed to make us a hot and welcome cup of tea and a tour of the factory. The tour is free and there is a small shop to purchase the estate Tea from. It is useful to offer the factory guide a small tip of 100/200 rupees. The factory is full of the most original machinery much of which is still in operation today, so if you are a lover of this sort of thing, you would definitely enjoy a visit. I was surprised at how quickly tea leaves are turned into tea, within 24 hours and that the aluminium lined bags they pack the tea into at the end of the process can keep the tea for upto 2 years. The estate announces that it is an ethical company with some opportunity for the workers to be involved and would appear to offer more medical care and education than some others do. I wasn't sure about this place as there were some remarks about the speed of the tour and the guides accent, but we did not feel rushed at all and the guide was clear, helpful and very friendly. i've visited them today and was a great learning experience actually! my guide was a young Sri Lankan lady that had a great knowledge of tea and what goes into prepering a perfect cup. at the end of tje tpur they offer you one of the best orange pekoe i've tasted.... This tour is quite dull. It only took about 10 minutes, and no photos are allowed. If it was a free tour, it would be fine, but I'm not sure it's worth paying for. We saw the tea factory at the Heritance Tea Factory hotel- it was free, and much better. I only ever leave reviews when things are really good, or very bad and this was very VERY BAD. We had wanted to do the factory tour and were told on our arrival that we weren’t able to because the factory wasn’t open for visitors that day (oddly). We were told that the only two activities we could do where the two (more expensive at 1100 Rs pp) “experiences” of Tea tasting or Tea picking; we opted for the tea tasting. We said we understood that the factory was closed for tours but asked if it would be possible to pop our heads round to see the inside of the factory? The woman said yes. So we sat down for our tea tasting, and after 10 minutes a tray of tea was plonked in front of us, a different woman pointed and said some teas were strong and others weren’t, and then departed(!) There was no explanation about the variations of tea on the tray, how they are grown, or what they were even! Nothing. Nada. We were just left to our tray of random teas. It was an absolute joke. We tried to find someone to ask questions but got minimal information and no actual explanation on the process. We then said asked if we could have a quick look round the door at the factory, and the woman in charge said “yes that’s fine, that’ll be Rs.350 each” i.e. the cost of the tour which we had initially asked for and were told that we couldn’t do!! I queried why we were told merely 15 minutes earlier that we couldn’t do the tour of the tea factory, at which point the woman basically lied to us and claimed she had included it as an option!! She was basically scoffing at us as she spoke implying that all 3 of us had misunderstood. The Sri Lankan driver who had driven us there and was waiting and had heard the whole thing was as shocked as we were at the audacity of this woman. (And won’t be recommending anyone go there again). This is an absolute waste of time please avoid and don’t make the same mistake we did by going to this shambles of a factory. An interesting guided tour of the factory followed by a cup of their tea.  Only one of their products was available to sample as part of the price.  It would have been good to sample other blends as we had done at other tea fctories.  Price was 200 Rupees, which was reasonable -We went as a couple -A free tea at arrival was very nice and is for sale -the factory tour was very cheap and it lasted about 30mins. The lady doing the tour was very nice and the tour was informative -we had a short walk around the tea fields and its beautiful -i would recommend visiting this tea factory Thanks Sam For us, however, it was a beautiful experience: the plantation tries to respect ethics and sustainability criteria and for this reason it differs from the others. We visited the factory with the original 19th century machinery still working and the explanation was concise but exhaustive. At the end they offered us an excellent cup of tea, accompanied by a freshly fried spicy 'rollo': delicious. We had a very short, but still interesting tour in the fabric with the basic information about the producing of tee. Afterwards you get a couple of tee (no need to pay extra). Quick run through the production plant followed by two samples of tea to taste. Then you must buy. I was hoping to visit the tea plantation, but that was not part of the tour -perhaps due to the inclement weather. Not bad, fairly educational, wouldn't have felt too bad about missing this one. Interesting tour which shows you from start to finish how tea is produced. The machinery wasn’t working the day we went but the tea tour was still worth it. Free cuppa at the end. We visit Pedro tea factory in August 2018. It is only 10 minutes to Nuwara Eliya the factory is working only nights. They made a quick tea factory tour and served a cup of tea at the end of the tour. They are selling also their own tea. You are paying 250 rupies ( less than 2usd)  for person. You may find another place which is free on the way from Kandy to Nuwara Eliya. The visit at Pedro Estate was so nice. We could take a walk through the beautiful garden, taste delicious black tea and got a very interesting tour through the factory. Guide was very knowledgeable and was focused on explaining the tea making process rather than selling tea! The visit was nice but a little bit short. We had a “free” tea cup at the end of the visit. The views are beautiful from the factory. On arrival we were given the option of tea factory tour for Rs 250 or tea picking for Rs1000. We went for the latter which turned out to be a huge mistake. We were shown how to pick one tea leaf then left to our own divides for 20 minutes, whilst the guide was preoccupied with her phone. We were not told anything about the tea plantation or the tea picking process. After this we were taken on a tour of the factory, but all the machinery was off as they only use the factory at night. During the tour the guide was more interested with her friends, giggling and waving at them, than giving us any real information about the factory. She also spoke in autopilot and was inspiring. Overall a very disappointing visit and not worth the money. This trip was unforgettable for all the wrong reasons. Very disappointing visit lasting 10 minutes for a cost of 500 rupees. We visited with a couple who had been to other much nicer free tea factories. Incomplete visit Don’t go on Saturday. There’s nobody working. The tour is done in 10 minutes (does not include the fields, just the factory) and the price is not worthy (at least at the weekend). I have visited other tea factories for free and you just pay for what you buy. Here we were charged 500LKR per person for practically nothing. A waste of money and time during the weekend. This is a very historical site in the tea industry. Pedro owns Lovers Leap. Unfortunately the lunch bell rang at 1pm and all the pickers in the plantation and people in the factory disappeared for 1 hour. There was no activity in the factory and the tour guide said they make the tea at night. She struggled to answer my questions and couldn’t say the difference between black tea and green tea. It would have been helpful to have an information sheet in English. There was no tea tasting either. Good view of the plantation though. Pickers willing to have photo taken if money given. I didn’t realise til after the visit about the historical importance of Pedro, that wasn’t mentioned either. They are marketing themselves as an eco centre also, but again not sure why? There is a huge woodshed out the back that seems to run the original equipment from the 1890’s. For 100rp you get a 20min tour of the production process from them delivering the tea from the field to the packaging.  Was interesting. We were really disappointed with our visit to Pedro Tea Factory. Firstly when we arrived noone greeted us, the staff all ignored us and it was really unclear where we were supposed to go. We figured out we had to buy tickets and were then told to wait 10 minutes until the tour started. We waited 30 minutes without any further communication about the tour. Another staff member did give us a cup of tea but with no explanation, we weren't really sure if it was actually supposed to be for us. We chose a table to sit at, but they were all very dirty with bits of food and flies and dishes unclear from previous guests. Finally our tour guide came to get us for our tour, she was very unenthusiastic and came across as in a hurry and disinterested. During the tour, our guide was very rude to other guests in our group. The guide's accent was a bit hard to understand at the best of times (not her fault as English is her second language), but she told two members of our tour group (who English was also not their first language for) that taking photos was not allowed. They clearly did not hear her/understand what was being said, and instead of gently making sure they understood, she yelled at them ""do you even speak English?!"". After the tour was finished she just walked off without saying goodbye or thanks or anything. Such a bad experience from start to finish! The previous day we did a tour at Damro and it was amazing! I'd definitely recommend avoiding Pedro and going to Damro instead. probably best to see during the wek we went on a saturday and nothing working guide was pleasant and tea afterwards refreshing no hard sell which was nice as well Generally good Tea Factory and Explain also good. Helpful staff and they served a Good Tea as well. Tea Field is good and well maintained. Visited here on our mini tour of Sri Lanka, excellent visit with really good guide. You would never understand how much time and effort goes into a cup of tea when drinking it back home To be fair, it was interesting and was set in stunning Countryside. We learned about the tea making process and that was an enjoyable experience - but because they make ‘light’ tea most of the really interesting work and processing is done overnight, meaning the tour was primarily around an empty and quiet factory - more like a museum tour, which is not what it was billed as. Worth it ifyou have time to kill and are in the area, but would not go out of your way. Plus, as always, the shop is very overpriced. They took us Factory Tour and explain Tea producing procedure A - Z.  Offered nice cup of Tea.   You can buy fresh Tea as well. If you are a Tea drinker, this is a must place to visit. The factory visit gives you a glimpse of how your favourite tea is made and tasting it. They offer some of their teas for free to try them but others are just for buying. The place is a working tea  factory. They make a real effort to be both welcoming and informative. You get a well explained tour of the whole factory and emerge with a better understanding about tea. We were taken to this plantation and factory by our driver as part of a planned itinery. The tour of the plant was very informative and the guide spoke extremely well. We left very informed, just unfortunate that we didnt see the factory in action (works at night), and couldnt take photos in the factory.  Got to taste some tea (without milk as its not the done way), and walk amongst the plantation. We left satisfied that we had been to what we wanted to see and hear, but feel there could have been more. Sadly didnt see anyone picking leaves, but that was just where we were at the time. All family happy. Average place to see tea garden, little bit of history of tea industry in Sri Lankan hill country. You could walk down the tea bushes. You can buy tea and refresh yourself with a nice and warm cup of tea. Even though the factory was not working (tea production occurs at night here) the guided tour was very informative.  The tea rooms are quite nice and offer great views out over a picturesque section of the plantation.  The cup of tea was lovely also! Unfortunately the size of the tour group (about 20) was too large for the factory tour guide to manage However, the tour was still interesting in terms of the process of making tea from growing to packaging for the market Tea can be purchased at very reasonable prices. Short (15 min) visit to the factory for 200 LKR per person with a free cup of tea afterwards on a terrace with beautiful view. Our guide looked little bit annoyed. Not allowed to take pictures inside. It is easily reachable by public bus from the city centre (around 25 LKR per person, 15min). You can also take a walk from here to the Lover's Leap watterfall. Visited Pedro having been left wanting on a trip to Stone Gate the previous day. Pedro is actually based on the plantation and you can see the tea plants and pickers in action. Good tour and explanation, but machines aren’t working as the quality of tea they produce is made at night (when cooler to slow down the the fermentation process) and I guess it would be dangerous anyway to walk around a factory in production anyway. Nice cup of tea afterwards, and a very soft sell in the shop, with really good prices. Afterwards had a wander through the tea plants and then walked up to Lovers Leap. Well worth a visit. The price of the tour is not much, but the commentary was pretty uninspiring. The only two sections of the factory working at the time was the sorting of the finished tea into its various grades from the top grade orange pekoe to the tea dust.  We did see the first process but I didn't hear the name where the leaves are initially dumped in big bays to be dried with wood fire heat to remove enough moisture from the leaves to make them rubbery and then allow the rolling process. But there was no machine on to show the rolling, the fermentation, or the cutting etc. After seeing the sorting, we saw the packaged product ready for auction, then  it was back to the shop for a cup of their tea but no explanation of what we were drinking etc. So a pretty short and basic tour of the factory with a commentary that hard to hear at the best of times, but was inaudible when the sorting machine was on. We didn't see any tea pickers.  I think by the afternoon they were all clocking off. The tea fields were nice to look at.  The tea in the cafe was nice. Visit this place for a nice cup of tea and to buy tea leaves. Also they do factory tours where the kids can learn the routine and tasks of a tea factory. I've visited many tea plantations in India and Sri Lanka. The tour here was very good and everything well explained. The guide didn't take us into the plantations or explain about Silver tips, white and green tea. Also, the tea offered after the tour is nice but the Damro tea factory is much better for a relaxing tea (free) and cake (paid) overlooking the plantations. Blue Field is also good to visit. Nice little tour that explains all about tea production, you get to see all the equipment and a guide with a decent cuppa afterwards. Very relaxed and interesting insights into employment practice from the various worker notices on the walls. We combined with a walk up to Lovers Leap waterfall about 40 minutes round trip through the tea plantations Smiles all round, we took the  bus back to NE, no bother Admission 500 LKR well worth it. A three wheeler from Nuwara Eliya centre to the Pedro costs 350-400 rupees. The estate is in a picturesque setting and the tour is very reasonably priced at 250 rupees per person. Pedro cares about its staff and the environment - both important factors when considering which plantation to visit. The workers were off and the cleaners were in when we went round, that was fine as they warned us. The best part was talking to the tea pluckers at the end. And the cup of orange pekoe! I visit with my guest to buy tea. Then i wait 1/2 hour for factory visit so return from factory wait 1/2 hour again for tea taste. Very bad restaurant area toilet smel always. After buy tea wait 1/2 hour paid bill one lady is working issuing factory entrace ticket explain tea cash collect. I dont know why managemet sleep like this i m giving instruction all visitors dont go for time weast. Everything about the visit was bad. Not sure if we got a particularly unmotivated guide, but she just repeated what she memorized and explained what each machine does. We asked several follow up questions, but her answer was not insightful. Also, we all get free tea but honestly the tea tasted worst than the cheapest tea I drink back home. They provide third grade tea. After drinking that tea, I definitely didn’t want to buy any tea from the factory. Lastly, now the tour fee is 250 lak. Overall, it was a waste of time. I could google and drink better tea at home. Their prime intention is to make you purchase their products. the climate is very soothing. can visit. Unlike the Damro plantation you have to pay for a factory tour - which wasn’t actually productive at the time of our visit ,  just running the sizing side of the process.  We waited an age in the foyer for any instructions on where and when the tour would start. The lady who finally showed up led us off in too large a group size - such that only those directly next to her could hear her. Beautiful experience of watching ladies picking tea leaves (very friendly to chat to) walking through fields and understanding the tea process. After the tour a complimentary cup of tea was provided. Very enjoyable tour. Advice to come there before 4pm if you want to see the machines still working. Nice tea shop. Offers guided tours in the tea factory. At the end of the tour you are served a cup of tea in the café with a nice view. You can take walk in the hills. It was a Sunday they were washing down the machinery and finishing production, fascinating. Like stepping back in time. Situated proudly as the tea factory at the highest elevation within Sri Lanka the factory produces some of the best tea in the world. A tour can be organised on arrival to see the process. A tea shop also allows you to taste and buy some tea. Stunning nature surrounds this old tea factory, which is still in full activity. The tours around the factory gives you a good insight in the process of tea making, and makes you humble to every glass of tea you drink thereafter. Also, seeing the hard work of the tea picking ladies, makes you wonder why the tea are not more expensive, and you really wish someone would increase their income a bit. If you take a picture with them, be wise enough to give them a few hundred rupees - they will appreciate the added income Went round as a small group, unfortunately due to the rain the factory wasn't operating so we couldn't see it in action. However it was good to see and learn about the process & machinery, the guide though wasn't able to tell us anything about the history and was unable to answer a lot of questions. We did a short tour here. I enjoyed seeing the old factory and old machines that are all still in use. You can see some old photos as well  of important people who have visited over the years. A good explanation of how tea is made. A nice cuppa at the end as well. The factory tour itself cost 500LKR and for that you get to walk around the factory and see all the different machines and different stages of the tea making process. Our tour Gide spoke very good English and took the time to answer questions.  The tour maybe lasted around 20-30mins.  You can then sit in the cafe and taste one of the teas for free. There is also a gift shop.  The views are really nice. I’ve been to several tea factories in Sri Lanka and Pedro is nice as you get to see a working factory. Sadly on the day we went it was not operating due to a public holiday but nevertheless you get to see inside it and you can tell that it’s not just a display factory like many others I’ve been to. The tour was only 200rps and included a cup of tea at the end (which wasn’t great). I wouldn’t buy tea here but if you’re into your tea and want to see a functioning factory it’s worth a visit. Make sure before you pay for the tour that you check that it actually is a production day. We payed only to find it was not even in operation that day. It was informative even though it wasn't running. We went here for the tour and tea picking experience. Tour was very informative but you weren’t allowed to take photos. I was impressed some of the machines were installed in 1950s- built to last in those days! Tea from here is wholesale sold on to big companies who blend it to their own specifications. There were 65kg bags in the packing area! At the end you get a cup of tea to try. Being a photographer I really wanted to get some photos of the tea pickers but it seemed they weren’t working the Monday we went. We managed to see some further out of town so got some pictures then. Worth a visit! I had already visited two tea factories so i did not bother taking the tour, but i rested in the cafe where i watched a documentary about Pedro Tea Estate and then enjoyed a free cup of tea. However there were quite a few people taking the tour and they seemed satisfied. I hiked here after passing by Lover'sLeap waterfall, but the last kilometer is along a busy road which was not too enjoyable. Wonderful visit set in a wonderful area. Staff friendly and a great tour around the working tea production. Tastings offered of various teas and the opportunity to purchase. Really enjoyed the tour and very well explained how teas are dried and prepared. Highly recommended and thank you for allowing the public to visit. Pedro tea factory offers its visitors an interesting guided tour of the factory, giving valuable insight to all aspects of tea such as, steps of processing, types of tea, how it is being marketed etc. This factory belongs to a well established tea plantation group that supplies teas to many well known brands in the country, such as Dilmah. Guides speak good English and are professional and friendly. The tour takes only about 30 minutes. One must purchase an entry ticket which costs around Rs.250/= per person. *** Make sure to be there by 8.00 am in order to see the factory in full operation as they start their processing work very early in the morning. If you happen to go later in the day, you can still get a tour of the factory but you will not get to see as much, since the work is mostly done by mid morning and the workers get on with cleaning the machinery. Nevertheless, it would still be educational and worthwhile. At the end of your tour, you get to enjoy a complimentary cup of freshly brewed tea while enjoying the view of their beautifully maintained tea gardens. They also sell some fine teas, if you wish to purchase any. These teas are of very good quality, you'll not regret buying some. This was one of the main reasons for our trip to Sri Lanka and this was such a disappointment. The tour when it got underway was taken by a lady guide who seemed so un-interested in her job and the customers were an inconvenience. It was so rushed and a large group whereby it was difficult to hear what was being said. This lady did not appear to want to be there and her body language exuded this. It was so rushed. Very very disappointing, don't waste your money, a small as the fee is, or more importantly your time you will be under whelmed It is worth taking the time to do the tour: very informative and interesting! It only takes 30 minutes, and then you can their Tea. The factory tour was very quick and it was difficult to hear what the guide was saying. Explanations (what we heard) were exceptionally brief and we were not allowed to really look at the process or take photographs. I have visited the Pedro factory twice now, once with my partner and a second time with my Mum. It is very reasonably priced at just 200rs for a 20-30 minute guided tour and cup of tea. Our guide Kalaivane was superb! Friendly, informative and the daughter of a tea picker so able to gave a very personal and honest account of the tea industry. An enlightening experience I would definitely recommend! We intended to go on a factory tour, but they told us the factory wasn’t running at the moment. We decided to do a tea tasting instead. 6 cups of tea were put in front of us without any explanation.. I then asked someone for an explanation, she just told me which cup was which tea, no further explanation. We came here in the afternoon of our day trip to Nuwara Eliya after riding the scenic train. Blue Lanka, our tour agency, recommended it so we thought we would give it a try. The factory is wonderful and the guide of the factory spoke great english. It was great to see the tea making in progress and smell the tea in its rawest form. Then, there was the tea tasting. The first couple teas come free while the others cost money to taste. All the teas are great and they bring out an additional rare (we don't know if it actually was) tea for us to try. This tea was 150 USD per kilo....the tea plantation was wide, beautiful and spacious. The tea ladies always beckon you over for photos (and tips). Overall, a wonderful tea plantation and I would recommend coming here. Went to this factory to see the tea process.  As others have said, nothing working on the day.  We got a guide who was very quietly spoken and difficult to hear.  She told me off for having my camera open and when I asked her a question she told me to ask one of the tourists and flounced off in a huff, bringing our tour to an end.  Nice location but staffer was rude.  She was the only rude Sri Lankan we came across in our 1 month holiday, so it really left an impression (not a good one). We had a nice tour and learned a lot about tea. Try to visit on Tuesday through Friday. On Monday there is not tea to process since they don't pick on Sunday- something we learned to our chagrin. This wasn't a planned visit...on our way back from Lover's Leap our tuk driver suggested a visit to take part in their factory tour.... even though we've done this a couple of times before we thought why not and proceeded.... And it turned out be the best tea factory tour we've had so far! It was a precise and concise tour of 20 mts where they take you through each division of the factory while explaining the tea making process from end to end. And it was also the most informative of all the tea factory tours we've had so far. The lady who did the tour did an excellent job. She was very knowledgeable and answered many questions. We went there around 10.30 am and immediately joined a tour that was just about to start. After the tour you get a nice cup of tea. (I think there are tours every half an hour.) If you arrive while a tour is ongoing they will serve you tea first which you can enjoy in their tea lounge while enjoying the lovely view. We paid LKR 500 each and I think it was the same for locals and foreigners. No photos or videos are allowed inside the factory. [If I am nitpicking, the aprons they provide visitors to wear during the tour can do with a makeover.] We Also learnt that the name of the Estate is pronounced as ""Peedro"" (not ""Pedro"")  same as how the British colonists called ""Piduruthalaga"" the highest mountained ""Mount Pedro"", pronounced as ""Mount Peedro"". The factory is quite close to Nuwara Eliya town. Road conditions are good. It's on the side of the Udupussellawa road and there is ample parking inside the property. They also have a collection of single estate tea for sale. If you are interested in touring a tea factory and learning about the tea making process I would highly recommend this tour. Given the importance of tea to Sri Lanka it seemed odd not to try and learn a little about the history of the industry, the people who work in it and the journey it makes from the beautifully cultivated hillsides to our daily brew. This tour, which took around 2 hours touches on most of the those topics. Having been warmly received in a very modern facility, we were each given a gown to wear and ushered off in a small group tour of the facility. This starts with learning about the picking process and the pickers, moves to the drying and a discussion about what makes each type or grade of tea, to the rolling, sorting and packing. Our tour guide was a 4 th generation lady who was excellent and handled even the toughest question with an interesting answer. We liked her a lot as it was obvious what she was doing mattered to her. With the tour over you get to enjoy a nice cuppa. If you are in the area you really should do one of these tours and this one is pretty decent. We took this tour and another on the same day, this tour was educational and we learnt a lot about the tea making process which is good however there was no option to walk around the plantation after the tour, it seemed as though it was more effort and nobody came to show us the gift shop either which was strange. The tour cost 250LKR pp. It was a rather hurried trip and we only stayed for around 30 mins from arrival time to leaving. Other plantations offer a more relaxed welcome. Spent an hour being shown around the factory having the process explained to us. This was followed by a taste of their tea in a very pleasant café. Tea was so good I ordered some when I got home. Good way to spend some time. Did both factory and picking tour (1000 rp each). Factory not working Sunday and no pickers because of wind, however an excellent tour ... very good English. Tea tasting was a single cup, but very nice. Picking was fun and got some good photos. Very close to Nuwara Eliya and lovers leap waterfall Did the detailed survey of tea factory . where we wereexplained of how the different kinds of tea powders are made We paid £26.71 per person for 6 people for a private tour.  The tour company didn't realise it was a public holiday and so there were no pickers on site and the factory wasn't working.  There were people on site who greeted us and actually did give us a tour but, not realising we had pre-booked the visit, they said it would cost us SLR200 each - i.e. approximately £1!  So - in essence, we paid £25 for a very expensive taxi ride from our hotel to the tea plantation approximately 3 km away!  You can turn up at the Pedro Tea Plantation at any time and be given a tour for SLR 200 and the price of a Tuk Tuk from town.  Having said that, the tour was very interesting. Nice tea estate and one of the oldest. Tour of the factory is not free. There are other 2 tea factories in Nuwara Eliya , which I believe are better in terms of service. Staff seemed to be least interested in selling the products, which is unusual for Sri Lanka. Had a great experience . Wonderful day and great fun. A wide variety of items. Good explanation of all the different types of items We learnt more from our guide before we got to this place. It was interesting but missing parts of information regarding the growing of tea. It would have been more interesting if the factory was actually working the afternoon we visited. We were told they only function at night due to the correct temperature for processing tea. The guide tried her best, but she is average and her explanations were very general and not insightful. The factory is in operation only at night hence the instruction given to us on the process was  more or less in theory. The factory has a good view but still not worth the price you pay and the time spent. We were greeted with a hot cup of team (no milk or cookies) but it was refreshing. It requires a small fee to enter inside the factory. Unfortunately we visited it on Sunday so we could not see if live but we still received a guided tour of the factory inside and how tea is made . Tea factory with factory tour and shop plus nice views. We had a brief group tour which cost 250LKR each for approx 30min tour. The tour guide was arguing with workers for a long period of time and I got the sense we were not welcome to watch the workers load up tea. That said we had a rudimentary tour of the factory and I left with more knowledge about tea than I came with. At the end we all had a complimentary cup of tea which was very nice and were encouraged to buy some tea at the shop. I think the tea here is better than other places but a bit disappointed by the tour. One can learn all about tea making in this beautiful tea factory. A guided tour takes you around the tea factory and the guide explains to the group all about the process involved from the time the tea leave is plucked to the entire process of drying and the end product which we drink! Lovely, quaint, old tea factory. Tour was very informative and views were fantastic. Tea quite expensive. The tour was short and underwhelming. I came out with as little knowledge as I went in.  Far nicer is the Hertance tea hotel. The factory tour is extremely well presented and any questions from the visitors were well dealt with.  Not to be missed if one has the opportunity to go The tour was excellent throughly explained how the tea was made from start to finish. Would recommend We went into the visit without expecting much; there were mixed reviews so we just hoped it would either be good or funny if it was a total failure. After paying for our tour (250LKR per person) we had to wait for a guide to arrive, although this only took a few minutes. After the guide arrived we went into the factory. It was pretty... empty. It also seemed like the woman who gave us the tour was sick and tired of her job because she zoomed through the factory like a Formula 1 car with rockets strapped on the back. I also think it will be pretty hard for most non-native English speakers to understand what the guide is saying. The whole tour wasn't very convincing, nothing was working and there wasn't much of an impression to be gained from the tour. Moreover, the tour seemed kind of fake, after we noticed the ""bags with tea"" in the storage room had a text on them saying they were from March 2018. TL;DR - It was a short but decently fun tour, just don't go in with too many expectations because you will most likely be disappointed. Having visited a working factory previously , I was disappointed to pay 1000 Rupees each person to wait for a group to form then start the visit. No photos allowed inside the factory.The girl gave good explanation but at times it was difficult to hear what she said. Only the fanning was working when the tea leaves separated debris thus dusts on the floor and staff cleaning machines. Only worth buying Pedro tea as nowhere else sells it ! 95 % for export and only 5 % probably in the shop . It’s the tea brits drink under different names! We had a fascinating guided tour of the factory and learned all about the tea picking, withering and packing process. We then had a cup of tea and wandered through the plantation itself. Highly recommended. While the guide was fine, it wasn't a very rounded tour. They should start with showing tea plucking, through the factory with showcasing the old wood burners and letting people see the different grades. It should end with a tea tasting where ppl can try to taste the differences. Great location and definitely worth taking the walk to the waterfall as well. The guides (I overheard a few while we were there) should try to introduce themselves and give a little personal story of their relationship to the estate. I would assume our guide was the daughter of a estate worker who has learned english and is now guiding groups which is nice to see. It wasn't a production day, no ladies in the plantation picking pekoe leafs, only a open day to have a stroll trough the plantation slopes, but this was beautiful. The shop was open for tea tasting and a lot of different types of Ceylon Black Tea for sale :)  (it was february) We had an excellent walk up to this place from our hotel at the quiet end of the lake. It's a peaceful walk (more interesting than tuktuk) We didn't do the tea factory tour but enjoyed a free cuppa overlooking the beautiful tea gardens and bought tea that was surprisingly well priced compared to the previous tea factory we visited. We then took a gorgeous walk up to lovers leap waterfall. Highly recommended. NB get the bus back into town from here,it's cheap as chips and do walk up to the waterfall the views are stunning Really enjoyed the short visit here. The tour guide was really good, knew her stuff and very friendly to chat to. Visited on Christmas Day when the processing wasn’t happening so can’t comment on what it would be like on a working day. We bought almost all the tea from the shop and it’s really tasted! the explanation of how they make the tea is really curious Went here to have a look at the lounge .. it’s beautiful surrounded and overlooking the tea estate !! A cup of tea here just to sit and watch the view is great .. went venturing out in the tea estate itself plucking tea leaves !! The tea cake wasn’t the most delicious ones I’ve had but it was okie !! They first take you on a tour around the place showing you how tea leaves are taken through various processes and result in the final product-tea powder.After that they give you a hot cup of tea which is very soothing and refreshing.They also sell tea packets freshly prepared in the factory at a nominal price.Overall a good way to spend  1 hr!!! The people try to force you to do the tour. The place is small and not as beautiful as other tea locations such as Talawakelle Tea Estate and Edinburgh Tea Estate. I would personally avoid and go to the above. Nice setting especially combined with a walk to Lover’s Leap Waterfall Factory tour is 250rp - we went on a Sunday and not much was happening so better to try another day.  It was nice walking around the tea plantation.  Staff were friendly and the cup of tea great. Visited with my dad, and we had a lovely walk down to the tea plantains were we could see the ladies busy at work. They were doing guided tours of the factory for a small price but as the machines were not working we did not join in. We did sit in the cafe and enjoy a lovely cup of tea. Found the service to be a little slow- but pleasant all the same. Good tour with a guide explaining the processes. Interesting to see how old the machinery was and still working. Strangely no photography allowed. Nice views outside of the reception area but not impressed with shop. 20 mins away from Nuwara Eliya city center,we bought tea leaves,I think tea leaves are in good quality,don't know excellent,price is too reasonable,anyhow we  enjoyed lot, Pedro tea factory is situated closer to Nuwaraeliya city limits. You can take a tuk-tuk from the town or bus which travels on udupussellawa road. You'll get a brief while moving on a factory visit about the tea making process where you can clarify yourself and finally you can enjoy a hot cup of Ceylon tea as well. :) One of the good factory visits and tea plantations. Reach there early before 9 AM to see the tea processing in action. Its ok to also go there later during the day, the tour person will walk you around the factory. Its a good educational tour for the kids. A nice tea factory where they make primarily black tea. Staff is nice which takes you through the factory and explain the process. Nice tea factory to visit. Thought I preferred the Ceylon Tea Museum near Kandy. But if you are in Nuwara Eliya and you didn't already visited something like that, don't hesitate it's worth a visit. The view there is also really nice. Not very special but it was fine. The view was very nice and the free tea and a good price for the cake. At first glance, the place looks nice except that the factory tour costs 500 RPS, If you want to see the tea fields and pick a little you will need to add 1000 rps Then if you want to taste a tea even a little to know what you are buying you will have to add 1100 rps All done in a clearly expeditious manner, Visit to the factory (20 mins), For the collection, we give you a bag, we tell you: you go there, you pick it up, you have 20 minutes and I will come back to pick you up! The store... No possibility of buying an individual box, there are only packs of 6 for the price of 6500 rps... No authenticity... Disappointed!!! This is a great place to go with kids. They have tea factory tour.u need to pay for that.But it’s worth for the cost and affordable. Poor service, we waited 20 min at the door for someone to even speak to us about a tour. The “tour” we did was tea plucking, she told us what leaves were picked in less than 1 minute and then we plucked a few and left. It was not at all a good experience. Yesterday we went to labookalie and it was a MUCH better experience. They give an educational tour in the  tea factory. About how the tea is being manufactured and types of tea. This is very good for adults  as well as  kids. They charge Rs. 100 per person ( for  locals). After the tour you will be given a warm cup of tea, free of charge. If you want you can by tea from their sales outlet. We enjoyed our tour of the factory although our guide was a quietly spoken girl. Afterwards, we were given a cup of tea in a pleasant little restaurant. Very nice. Takes about 15-20 minutes to do the tour. Worth a visit and the guide answered all the questions although I do not know why photos were not allowed to be taken. No pressure was put on us to buy the tea. Since we arrived together with the westerner groups we, can see the favoritism in entertaining guests by the staff. We went on a Sunday so no picking or processing happening but lovely staff showed us around .Certainly puts a different perspective on a simple cup of tea ! Such hard physical work for the ladies picking . Great tea samples after the tour. This very old original tea estate offers tours to visitors of the main factory during the day as the tea is actually made at night when it is cooler. Clear explanations of the various levels of tea and a beautiful cup of tea at the end. Stunning location close to town. An hour well spent on an introduction into how the Tea Leaf is made into Tea. From plant to the finished product. Well worth a visit I don't think it's worth it, but it is just 200 roepies. You will guided through the trees factory, she will tell something about the price of producing tea. But her English is not really good, it's a script. You can't understand it, it think Google helps you more about the proces. Extremely Disappointed – Not Worth the Money! Pedro Tea Factory is an absolute rip-off! They charge 1000 rupees just for a basic factory visit – no complimentary tea, no plantation walk, nothing extra. That price is outrageous considering other tea factories in the area offer much better service and a more immersive experience for half the price or even free. On top of that, the staff were shockingly rude and unwelcoming. They clearly don’t care about tourists or customer service. It felt like we were an inconvenience to them. There are plenty of other tea factories in Nuwara Eliya that are far more worth your time and money. Don’t waste either of those at Pedro. Highly disappointing. The tour guide from the tea factory has strong accent. It's very hard to understand what she said. The facilities inside the factory are good though. However, the souvenir shop was disappointing. Very few options and no price tag there. Also they use special names for different types of tea so even harder to know what types of tea they are. The only advantage is this tea factory is not too far. We have been to Bluefield tea garden and ceylon tea museum in Kandy. Those are much better places to buy tea in terms of varieties and prices. It is worth a visit as you get to see inside the factory and are taken through the whole tea production process. Then you get a cup of tea to taste and it is delicious. The tour and tea are free and given with the usual lovely Sri Lankan smile! A good tour, although rather quick (roughly 20-30 mins). We came on a Sunday so only one machine was working, and no tea picking - not to mention torrential rains. Our tour guide was really informative, giving us plenty of info although it would’ve been nice to hear about more about the founding of the estate and the fermentation process. But for 250lkr and a great cup of tea at the end (which we then purchased for a great price) it’s definitely worth the trip from Nuwara Eliya. The views are beautiful and I’m sure during the week when the pickers are out and the weather is more pleasant a stroll around the fields would be worth it. I’d recommend getting a list of questions you want to ask, as they’re happy to answer any questions if you find you haven’t had one answered. Paid 200 LKR for the factory tour which the staff told us would take 20 minutes. The machines weren't operating during our visit and we were completely fine with it. The tour took only 10 minutes and the guide wasn't knowledgeable at all. Everyone who left good reviews must have gotten a different guide. When I asked questions, she seemed very annoyed and was just hurrying us to get out of the tea factory to quickly end the tour. The guide is a local woman who is quite short and skinny (if you must know to avoid her). After the tour, they will serve you a cup of tea and it took them 20 minutes and after asking multiple times to serve us our tea. Very bad experience overall! Teas on sale are overpriced too. Other travellers we met who visited blue fields said that was really nice so perhaps check that out instead of Pedro. Bluefields offer free tour too I think! Avoid Pedro at all cost! Dropped by on the way from the Horton plains and weren't disappointed. A nice short tour in the plant with a cup of tea afterwards made the end of the day. One can crop the tea leaves as well but we were unlucky - it started to rain once we set off. Pleasant enough guided tour although not so much to see unless you come after 11.30 when the first tea comes in from the fields. Photography not permitted! Why not? Management policy apparently. Seriously? What’s the secret. A visit to a tea plantation last year in Kerala was much more animated and entertaining because they made sure to have a small batch of tea being crushed, rolled and dried specially for the fee paying visitors. Tea shop not impressive but maybe they’re more interested in selling by the sack at market than by the packet to tourists. I missed opportunity alas We were staying in Nuwara Eliya for a couple of days and wanted to visit a tea plantation and this was recommended by the hotel (Grand). We took a Tuk-tuk from the hotel and the driver waited for us while we did the tour (approx 45 minutes in total including time to drink and buy tea). Very informative tour with a chance to see production from start to end with a good tour guide who was keen to answer questions. Great selection of tea to buy with a good explanation of what you are buying. We brought lots back. This felt like a  much more local experience than the commercial plantation that we stopped at on our way out of Nuwara. So would definitely recommend this - local, less expensive and felt a bit more real. We had a very interesting morning here, the tour was informative and not too long, the factory still using machinery from the 1950s which are works of art in themselves. From the tea factory it's a good walk to Lovers Leap waterfall where you can see tea pickers at work. It's an easy bus ride from Kandy. Me my wife n daughter enjoyed this place. It was amazing to see the process and tea estate was very beautiful 👍🏻 Honestly we visited 2 tea factories and found this one the best . It was nice , the tour was really nicely done and the estates were soooo pretty and secluded. Totally worth the visit Nice guided visit to understand the process of making tea. After the visit you can walk in the plantations. It would have been nice to have a tea tasting at the end, as the visit is not free. Went here in the afternoon. No tour available. Shop is small, offers some tasting. Tea is quite nice actually. Not worth going out of your way to get her; if you are in the area, ok. We visited, when on our tour through Sri Lanka passing by, this tea factory with its old machines, had tour and bought some tea. It is worth to have a visit here - as well as strolling through the plantations - on public ways of course. Nice and beautiful place. The visit was very quick and hard to understand. Machines are not working during the visit because they work only in night time. They offer a very good cup of tea after the visit, and you can buy tea also but it's expensive. We preferred the visit of Dambatenne tea factory in Haputale. A very good tea factory, working mainly in the night. The tour costs 200 rupees, but include a complimentary excellent cup of tea, and the plantation grounds are very well tended and magnificent to look at. We arrived at the tea boutique just when a group started the factory tour. They told us the next tour would start in 20 minutes and asked us to take a walk around the tea plantation first. The view was truly amazing. After the walk, we went back to the tea boutique and waited. The group we saw earlier finished their tour and was given tea to drink. We continued to wait but nothing happened. Then a staff asked us if we wanted tea. We asked if the tour would start soon and was told that it would not start for another 15 minutes. We ended up waiting for around 40 minutes before the tour finally started. We were given aprons and shower caps to wear. The tour guide was soft-spoken and we could only hear part of the explanations. After the tour, we wanted to buy some tea to take home. There were many different types of teas and we had no idea about differences. When we asked the staff, she only gave us some half-hearted attention. It would have been better if they could put up signs next to the teas to explain the differences. Well worth a visit as it provides a great insight into the tea making process through the guided tour. This was followed by some tea sampling. Pedro is an ethical tea producer so well worth a visit. Since this tea factory was very close to our Nuwara Eliya hotel, we decided to take a tour.  It was a bit disorganized at the beginning, as we purchased our ticket and were then told to sit in a waiting area.  Meanwhile, we saw people gathering and being handed aprons, and turns out this was our group, but no one told us.  So we joined in and had an informative walk through the factory.  Most of the work is done at night, as the tea picked during the day has to dry, so only a couple of machines were actually running.  No problem, and they were nice enough to let us know this when we purchased the tour ticket. Our favorite part was the cup of tea provided at the end.  We enjoyed sitting outside on the balcony with a lovely view of the plantation.  We hope you enjoy the tour as much as we did! Thanks to our guide who was knowledgeable we left with a good understanding of the Tea Making process.  The factory is clean, staff are helpful and efficient and the complementary Tea is fabulous! 200 rupees and the best tour we did! An enjoyable guided tour around an authentic tea factory. All the equipment is on display and the guide explains what its used for, though what is operating depends on the time of day. The cup of tea at the end of the visit is outstanding. Be aware that you can't take photographs in the factory though. Good tour, very short but explain everything well. Interesting to see inside the factory and you can try the tea at the end. Only 200rupees Very interesting visit here finished with a lovely cup of their own home grown produce! Recommend a visit here. Nuwara Eliya is a hill-station and we were not going to leave without seeing at least a couple of tea gardens and tea factories. Two of the most famous tea gardens in this town are the Pedro Tea Factory and Damro Labookellie Tea Factory. We drove to the Pedro Tea Factory. This is NOT a working factory and therefore we decided to skip the factory tour and instead walked part of the tea garden. This was not a very exciting venture. However it was interesting to know that the tea made here is sold and repackaged by big brands. It was also educational to see the process of tea making.  Also the views at the location were great. We dint know this and ended up just taking a stroll at the tea gardens. You can also buy the tea at the factory. One of the reasons we went to Sri Lanka was to see a tea factory in production.  Owing to the type of tea they produce here the production only takes place at night.   We were given a quick tour around looking at inactive machines which made us none the wiser.   You are then left in the reception area to watch a marketing video about how wonderful Pedro is and how they are helping the community etc (and given a cup of tea!).   Given the lack of tea production you see on this waste of time tour, it would be far more useful to show a video of the tea production, at least then you would not feel you were leaving as badly informed as you were when you arrived!   There are tea factories where you can see tea being produced and I suggest you visit one of those!! Having spent time at other tea factories in Sri Lanka, we hadn't planned to visit but a miscommunication with our tuk-tuk driver brought us here en route to another activity; we weren't blown away by it and felt that the other factories we visited offer a better experience. We came on a non-production day and joined a tour with one other couple; it was delivered very quickly with very little enthusiasm and was not as interesting or informative as those in other factories we visited. At the end, we were given a cup of tea with no information as to what type of tea it was: more background and details would've been appreciated, or even a tasting of different types of tea. The views around the factory were amazing and it was fascinating to see the estates. Well worth a visit, very informative and interesting. All staff were friendly and no sales pitch at the end too We enjoyed a very interesting and informative tour of the tea plantation at the Lovers Leap Pedro Tea Factory. The tour is quite short and takes you through the factory, explaining the various stages in tea production from harvest to drying, to grading and to packaging. The guide spoke English and was very well informed about the process and the history of the plant. Afterwards you are given compkimentary delicious tea on the balcony overlooking the plantation where there are lovely views and you are able to go for a walk down among the tea plants which was something we really enjoyed. They have a small shop selling their tea if you want to buy presents, absolutely no hassle or pressure though. A great morning or afternoon out; highly recommended. Thanks to the Pedro tea factory staff. It was very informative tour inside of the factory (20 minutes). We visited the tea factory in August 2016. It was lovely and very informative! Unfortunately, we arrived at the factory the day after Poya day, so there was no tea to process. I think the whole tour lasted about 45 minutes and you get a free cup of tea to taste afterwards. This is an excellent Tea factory experience. The guide Kalai vani was excellent. The view is beautiful. Tea very good. A good experience. It was quick and short visit at the Tea Factory. It was good to see the machines and understand the process of making tea.In the end i manage to buy the finish product at their store in the same area. Although the machines were not working at the time of my visit at least I was able to see how the tea making process in reality. Its a good learning experienced and one of a kind. I visited the tea plantation as well along the road. Very nice atmosphere all green everywhere. We bought 2 tickets for factory visit and the tea collection, entire tour was super unorganized, lady who has provided the factory tour did the tour with unprofessional attitude as if she was forced to give us a tour; no communication whatsoever when we reached back to the main entrance. Then she gave us the baskets and told us to walk in the garden… then the toilets (female) were disgustingly dirty; flush was not working either. I would not do it or recommend it to any of my friends. Impressive to see all the tea plantations in Nuwara eliya, which are very big. We had a very good tour guide who showed us the factory and explained the process of making tea very clear. Also very impressive to see under which circumstances the employees live. This factory is rich in history. I must admit that the factory is very well run and please do join the tour, which is very informative. At the end of the tour, you will be served with a cup of very fragrant tea. The estate itself is beautiful....very green with a panaromic view of the area. I have visited a couple of tea factories in my life and in fact, this is the best of the lot. It is a ""must-see"" when you are in Nuwara Eliya We went straight to the Tea Boutique and separately ask two staff members for a cup of tea. They each told us to sit and wait then disappeared. Waste of time. Good place for a walk. Wandering amongst the tea fields and up to the waterfall was a tealightful experience. Went to get a cuppa after and it came with a free tour (200rps). Tour was short but informative and guide was pleasant. Sat down salivating in anticipation of our post tour beverage but unfortunately it failed to materialise. Asked the waitress twice but it appears it takes more time to make a cuppa than it does to dry and process tea. We sacked it off and went to town for lunch. Nice visit to small central located tea factory , in town of nuwara eliya , it was very Informatative , didn’t take hours and you got to see the working of how tea is made and processed . Very enjoyable Interesting tour but two groups merged to one as they were short staffed so over 35 people walking around the factory together was not ideal. Some of the group were elderly and the many steps and metal staircases were a bit challenging which also slowed down the tour. Free cup of tea at the end and the views from the cafe are fabulous. Our group visited the Perdro Tea Plantation & factory as part of our tour of the Hill country. They produce Lovers Leap ethical tea. We were shown around the factory by a local plantation worker who explained the tea production process & showed us the various steps from picking to drying & quality control. She was very interesting in describing a very labour intensive process. We also saw tea pickers & had a cuppa in the factory tea shop. Very enjoyable & informative. Good place to visit, you are taken round the factory to see the process. You get to try some tea on the verandah. Good little shop to buy the different teas. Staff were lovely They run guided tour every 30 minutes there and it is a small tea factory. Guide was very good, giving us a good overview of the process, but it remains quite small Wasn’t a high cost for this tour and you get to have a roam afterwards. Our tour guide doesn’t seem to get that much enjoyment from the job and it felt a little underwhelming but it was still informative and I learnt stuff about tea- which was the point. It’s good to combine with a loop walk up to lovers leap and then get a tuk tuk back to town The tour is short and I would have wanted a bit more info about the history and cultivating of the tea. best tea factory.  very nice. good explain staff. very taste tea in factory outlet.  best luck. I'm japan Should only visit this place if you have never been on a tea factory tour before. The guide was not very enthusiastic and could not communicate very well in English/answer questions that were not in the part of her script. The factory tour itself was very short and not very informative. Since the factory operates only at night we couldn't see any machine working or the end product from a particular machine. Maybe they should have kept samples from each stage for visitors to understand the various processes better. Nonetheless the view from their tasting area balcony was really nice and you were welcome to walk amongst the tree bushes It was unfortunate for me as I visited the Pedro Tea Plantation on Good Friday. There is still a factory tour but there was no production and we are only shown all the machines without the tea leaves. If you plan to explore the tea plantation, you might want to wear long pants. To get a nice shot in the middle of the tea plantation, you have to walk in between the super narrow path. Lovely tea factory with interesting tour which takes place every 10 minutes. Lovely outdoor area to have a cup of tea afterwards. It is a good experience to go inside the factory and know the processes of the tea industry and have a cup of tea in some beautiful terrace seeing the tea plantation and finally purchasing a good and cheap packs of some kinds of tea well worth a visit to see the different teas produced and how it is made. Guide was extremely knowledgeable and interesting We got to the tea plantation and the ladies at the counter told us that the machines were off, so if we wanted to, we could still pay to enter but no tour was going to be offered because the production had finished. We hung out at the lounge and had a cup of tea but it's a level of poverty tourism that I am not comfortable with. All you can see are the tea plantations and the women that work there. If you read a little bit about it, you'll realize that these women are very underpaid. So you end up sipping a cup of tea looking down on the workers from a viewing deck. Not really my kind of thing to do, so I'll just advice you to avoid it altogether. The tea plantations in themselves are beautiful-ish. They're green trees... there are only so many pictures you can take of green trees. We really enjoyed the tour. The lady was so proud of her culture and heritage, it was lovely. Nice grounds and walks in the area. Interesting to see the factory, good place to visit in this area but felt it missed out on providing a bit more detailled information. Excellent tour followed by a lovely cup of Pekoe. No better place to find out what makes a good cuppa and - see photos- a bit of a looker! We had a four-person lead with another couple. The employee guided us in the fast-track max. 15 minutes through the factory. She spoke very good English, but she rattled down the information as if memorized, so you could hardly follow. In the end, there was no tea tasting, the real reason we had visited the factory in the first place. On request, it was said that there were currently no more samples. Milk was also no longer in stock. Too bad! We went there by bus for just a few rupees from Nuwara Elya bus station. Nothing special, but nice to see and get a tour through the factory. The tour costs 200 LKR per person and takes around 30 minutes. Afterwards you get a tea in their small shop. We had a four here with tea tasting at the end. It’s an eye opener to what the ladies experience during their working hours in the factory especially in the drying room which is extremely hot! Tour guide was brilliant and very informative. Tea tasted so good had to buy some! Very hospitable staff, breathtaking views whilst you away the tour sipping fresh tea. They even have a little shop where you can buy some tea",3.8,400,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/04/57/9c/a7/pedro-tea-estate.jpg?w=700&h=400&s=1,0.0,43.0,4.75,1.25,19.0,32.0
Pitamaruwa Mini Worlds End,"Pitamaruwa Mini Worlds End. After a couple of hours of driving in a bumpy path, I reached the first tracking route We followed the white point for half an hour until I reached the edge of the abyss It was a great feeling The Pitamaruwa Mini Worlds End is located at the end of the lush tea Plantation Roeberry Estate.When you reach the top of the hill it is possible to see, other ranges of rocks such as Dehigala and Doraboda covered in with the thin forests.Traveling distance is around 200 Km from Colombo . View from this place is awesome & beautiful.Initially we thought stop to go there and return back.But after reach there,we are really satisfied . Beautiful place ,you should go.but please don,t pollute the area.As well very dangerous place.Don't go very near.",5.0,3,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/29/62/21/47/mindila-bake-house.jpg?w=100&h=-1&s=1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,100.0,0.0
Royal Botanical Gardens,"Royal Botanical Gardens. A very good place to visit as part of the visit to Kandy. We used the electric cart for  Lkr 2000 which was worthwhile as the driver was very knowledgeable about the flora and the history. Downside is the poor toilet facilities ( donot even go near them) lack of proper parking facilities. Ripping off the tourists as it is the norm everywhere in SL. Not worth Rs3000 but good vfm for the locals.  Wouldn't recommend Lovely gardens, very well maintained, enjoyable few hours, worth going to have a wander (a few monkey's there too). We stayed at Hanthana House just outside of Kandy which was fabulous and their driver took us on a tour of Kandy which included here. A tranquil place after all the noise from traffic. Lovely gardens, especially the number of different trees. Orchids were good, but a small display, we are used to the orchid garden in Singapore, which I reckon must be the best in the world. Botanical Gardens of Peradeniya - 147 acres in extent, this is the best and the largest garden in Sri Lanka that a visitor to Kandy should never miss. Created in the 14th Century as the Pleasure Garden of Kandyan Kings, the Royal Botanical Gardens of Peradeniya is surrounded by the river Mahaweli on three sides and is connected to the opposite bank by a suspension bridge. With more than 4000 species of flora, the garden is an example of the wealth and beauty of the tropics. With more than hundred varieties of palm trees, five palm avenues where palms such as Talipot grow to an immense size, wonderful arches of glossy foliage, lovely fernery, and orchid houses with rare blossoms and spice trees in groves make it a rich botanical heritage in the world. A great place to visit, interesting trees, flying foxes, according to the guide 24,000 of them, a lake, an orchid house and just a really peaceful place to stroll. We could have spent longer here but really enjoyed the visit. If you in Kandy it is a must. Entrance is 1500 rupees. Beautifully landscaped and well maintained botanical garden with many species of bamboo and tropical trees. Lovely to walk around in for an hour. Squirrels, monkeys and bats watching. And to the young Sri Lankese couples in love who sit here together on a bench. Perhaps because they have no privacy anywhere else. People who whinge that you have to pay entrance and much more than the locals, I recommend staying home. By Dutch standards the entrance is very reasonable. Not so much things to do in Kandy, but this park  botanical garden it's a must! Absolutely impressive, for a nature lover is astonishing to see those giant trees! Good gardening, very instagramable! the staff working at the ticket counter were extremely rude and unhelpful to us, arguing with us over the price of a ticket for my wife, who holds Residence visa in Sri Lanka, demanding for us to change our local tickets for tourist. would not return here. Not somewhere we would normally go but had a spare afternoon and made a visit. Very glad we did, beautiful and extensive gardens full of extraordinary trees and specimens. Need at least a couple of hours to explore - suspension bridge over the river, fruit bats flying about and hanging down/dripping from the trees for the night, fascinating canon ball tree and many more surprises. We were taken to the gardens by our guide ‘Obama’. It was a beautiful and relaxing place to visit, except the bangers being set of to scare the fruit bats off! We really enjoyed our time there. The orchid house, the avenue of palms and all the different examples of plants and trees were well worth the visit. We both would definitely like to visit the gardens again. We visited the Royal Botanical Gardens with friends and thoroughly enjoyed another walk through the beautiful gardens. There is always something new to see every time we go there, including the area of trees planted by famous visitors - King Edward VII and Czar Nicholas II for example. Beautiful gardens just outside of the town, quite large well laid out and easy to navigate , lots of unusual plants and trees with a large poulation of fruit bats at the top end of the gardens. Well worth a trip and easy to spend 3 or 4 hours here. Nice orchid house and a variety of animal and bird life. Good variety of flora. Entrance fees on a higher side 1500 LKR otherwise worth visiting and great place to visit especially in the afternoons. this botanical garden is said to be the garden used by the last king of kandy to meet his queen and stroll which was later improved by the British. a highlight of this garden is the orchid museum which has many varieties of orchid flowers. It was great to spend a few hours wandering around the gardens. There were a number of school groups at the gardens when i visited and one group took great delight in meeting me and having selfies. We were on a day tour from the Cinnamon Grand to the Elephant Orphanage and Temple of the Tooth and our guide, Nishantha, suggested visiting the gardens. They were stunning. Unlike NZ and the UK there is no need for glasshouses and we saw many beautiful and imposing plants. The age of the trees is impressive as it is an old park (1371AD). The Great Circle was really interesting as dignitaries over the last 150 years have been planting trees. There was a riot of colour in places, awesome avenues and gigantic bamboos. The gardens are huge (147 acres) and  we would recommend paying 250 rupees (2 NZ$) extra and taking the shuttle tour if you only have limited time. You could easily spend a day here and it was a romantic spot for couples. Ok but not great. There are many huge trees, but not enough flowers or colorful shrubs imo. The place is big enough for kids to run around. But they mainly liked the squirrels and monkeys that we found, trees did not catch our attention too much mostly. Botanical garden is located approx. 5.5 km before the Kandy city center bordering Mahaweli river. A historical park dated back to 1371 has over 4000 species of plants including some endemic ones to Sri Lanka. Loved exploring rose and orchid gardens but, felt orchid varieties were not enough. But whatever available wad not disappointing. Enjoyed Walking along the two palm avenues and cabbage avenue. There are more avenues, but couldn't try them all. Entire park is approx. 147 acre which may take 1/2 day to cover. This centuries old botanical garden planned by the British in the centre of the hill station Kandy, Sri Lanka is huge. There are a number of covered exhibits category wise like seasonal flowers, cactus, perennial et al., The place is well maintained and the pathways are clean. A number of families picnicking in the park are also mindful of the trash they generate and are meticulous in keeping the area clean. There are a number of species of plants and trees which are imported from across the world and are thriving in the botanical garden. One needs atleast a couple of hours to walk around the garden and enjoy the nature. The entry fee to the garden is reasonable and the park is secured fully by barbed wire fencing. The security checks at the entrance are robust. Take your camera along. Recommended. The gardens are really worth the visit, I was shocked how much I enjoyed it. You need at least an hour Well-maintained park, nice flora (plants / trees / flowers) with some cute fauna around. It's pretty and spacious, and nice for a walk on a fine day, but nothing too special, if you compare it with all the other botanical gardens that lots of countries also have. Or maybe the hoards of flying foxes around are pretty special, if you ask me. They were all flying around in the skies, looking for a spot to rest amongst the tall trees. I'm not sure if that's a seasonal sight, but I saw them when I visited in March. However for them to be collecting entrance fees for it seems a bit of a money-sucking move. If I were to do away with any humility here, you're welcome to visit my country's botanical gardens. Singapore's Botanic Gardens is bigger, prettier, UNESCO-listed, and free to enter. Just sayin'. We visited the Botanical gardens in Kandy yesterday morning. We hired the golf buggy for one hour and were taken around the gardens by a guide who was very informative. We stopped and looked whenever we wanted to which was good. One of our group walked around but couldn't see all the gardens in that time therefore missed out on certain parts of the garden. We were short on time and apparently you need four hours to walk around the whole gardens. They are certainly worth a look at even if you don't have four hours. There is also a bus which takes about ten people. I enjoyed visiting this well marked botanical garden. Many varieties of plants and native trees here. There are some interesting palms and it’s nice walking around. I could only spend an hour but one could easily spend more time relaxing in the lawns. It’s right next to the river. Could have spent a whole day in the Garden as it is just gorgeous. The Garden takes up 147 acres with over 4,000 species. Lots of walking around but I did see a trolley bus. The garden has different areas including the Orchid House, Great Lawn, Lake, Spice Garden (reached via a suspension bridge), Flower Garden and Palm Avenue to name a few all with magnificent plant specimens. It will take a few hours but when you're tired you can sit down on beautiful manicured lawn and rest a while. There's a busy cafe near the Great Lawn but toilets are few and far between. We took side entrance using suspension bridge, which was fantastic. At the end of it number of monkeys “welcomed” us. You should be careful though as they are far for being innocent. The botanical garden is a must see in Kandy. It’s calm and relaxing and you can walk around as there is plenty shadow provided by some amazing trees. Entrance fee for 2 adults and 2 children is 4500 Rs. We spent 2 hours here on the way from Kandy to Nuwara Eliya, enjoyed it very much and would recommend a visit.  Be prepared though for not much information in english or labelling of the plants and trees Very boring place in Kandy. It’s a normal garden for most of the people, however it is heaven for plant lovers as they can find variety of trees and flowers over here. Nothing to do here and you will find lots of local couples romancing behind the trees. Also you will find lots of local school students coming for a day picnic here. Fees is too high for visitors which 3000 Rs for a couple. Entry to a garden with nothing to do is very high. Moreover there are buggies operating in the garden but again at a very high cost and their availability is very low. You will have to wait a lot for your turn. Not a worthy place to visit! Avoid if you can! Well worth going and spending half day here. There are less flowers in the gardens than I expected and the gardens are dominated by large trees, with some particularly impressive specimens. There are also large collections of Bamboo and palms. There is also a reasonably nice orchid house. I think I was most impressed by the large number of flying foxes (bats) that roost in the trees in the corner near the suspension bridge. There are thousands, and the information board says 24k which I can believe. They make quite a racket, and you do see quite a number flying around which is impressive as they are huge. One minor critism is that there were too few benches, and those that were available were always occupied by courting couples, it seems to be where they come. Overall a great place to spend a few hours, although not in the same league as other  botantical gardens such as the one in Singapore which is a lot bigger with a vastly superior collection of orchids. I visited here in December. The weather was nice and the gardens were beautiful! There were a wide variety of vegetation, including lots of tall trees, and very pretty plants. There were also lots of monkeys chilling around the place. There are bats too, you can hear them up in the trees. They are big bats, but I was told they are vegetarians. The grounds had lots of families and couples hanging about but it def did not feel crowded. There are bathrooms in the garden and they seem sanitary. Highly recommend! Really nice vast garden lots of interesting trees from all over the world. The garden is home to 24,000 bats which can be seen hanging from the trees, breathtaking. There are  also monkeys in the garden as well as a suspension bridge over a river which can be walked on. There is a lovely buffet that can be had for lunch as well. We went to the Botanical Gardens as part of a two day trip organised by Sam Sampath, Big Brother Tours. Sam had organised a cart and a guide to take us round and I was glad that he did. There is so much to see and a huge area to cover, we learned so much from our guide that we would otherwise never know. The flora is beautiful and the gardens very well maintained. Thoroughly enjoyed our visit and would recommend. We loved exploring the beautiful grounds of the garden and only wish we'd had longer there. We arrived mid afternoon with our young children who adored the space to runaround and explore. They spent time looking at the different flora and fauna and admiring sights and sounds of the birds and numerous bats. We had been told there was a chance of seeing monkeys but were overwhelmed to observe them closely on the suspension ('dancing bridge'). We had a truly fabulous time visiting and would recommend it to everyone. It's really worth visiting these gardens and don't skimp on time as there's a lot to see. It's beautifully laid out and well signposted. This place really is a gem and oh so beautiful but again foreigners will pay for the fact that they are foreigners. Effective August, 5 (we visited on the 6th🙈) the entrance fee was increased to 2000 Rupies. Still this place is worth a visit. Make sure to bring some time and enjoy the beauty of the park. There is lots to see and also enough spaces to rest. If this is not convincing you, just take a look at the pictures. A bit west of Kandy in Peradeniya lies this very popular site. It is spread over 147 acres or nearly .6 square kilometers. More than 4,000 species of plants, spices, palm trees and medicinal plants can be found here. It is a place for solitude, especially if you have come from the Temple of the Tooth. There are several avenues of note, including the Avenue of Palms. The Orchid House is visually stunning. This Garden was huge with lots of plants and tree but it was not as i expected from a Royal Garden. it was not a real organized Royal Garden In Royal Botanical Gardens, you can see another view of Sydney Opera and Sydney Bridge. The view is good, air is flash, you can see sydney people relax life style. Also, Mrs Macquarie’s Chair is in it and worth to see. Its a beautiful and well-organised garden, with some impressive trees. We were there around 2pm and walked for 2.5 hrs. Alot of shade and a good constant breeze kept us cool. We saw lots of squirrels, monkeys, lizards and a few interesting birds. The kids were pretty excited about spotting these. We also took lots of photos and making silly poses. All the trees and shrubs were impressive, and very interesting. The gardens were well kept and quite beautiful, looking like a scene from an European garden. Great walk after lunch and great family bonding too! One of the oldest botanical gardens in the world.  Our guide around the gardens was the botanist Bandara Palipana and he made it a most interesting tour.  We saw many trees and shrubs which were new to us and the stories behind some of the plantings was interesting.  The orchis collection has over 300 varieties on show.  The Cook pine (introduced from New Caledonia by Captain Cook) is unusual as always leans towards the equator.   HM Queen Elizabeth II, Lord Mountbatten, King George IV, Yuri Gagarin and others have planted trees there.  Lord Mountbatten used the old residence in the centre f the park as his headquarters as Supreme Allied Commander of South East Asia Command during WWII.  The gardens are kept in a pristine condition.  Many Bollywood films have used it for location shooting. Just 15 minutes from Kandy city, the Royal Botanic Gardens, Peradeniya is a must-visit for anyone who loves nature, photography, or simply a peaceful stroll. The gardens are huge and beautifully maintained, with over 4,000 plant species from around the world. My favourites were the colourful Orchid House, the impressive avenue of Royal Palms, and the massive Javan fig tree which is truly a wonder to see. It’s a very calm and relaxing place, with plenty of benches to sit and take in the scenery. You can easily spend 2–3 hours wandering here. Tip: Visit in the morning or late afternoon for softer light and fewer crowds. Wear comfortable shoes as the gardens are quite big, and bring your camera — every corner is a photo opportunity! Visited here while on a tour of Sri Lanka.  What an oasis of calm and tranquility!  Some very impressive tree lined avenues and many fabulous specimen trees. We visited Peradeniya Botanical Gardens in April with our family, and it was truly one of the highlights of our trip to Kandy. The gardens are vast, beautifully maintained, and offer a perfect blend of natural beauty and tranquility. Walking through the towering palm avenues, orchid house, and spice gardens was a relaxing and enriching experience. The sheer variety of flora was impressive, and the kids especially enjoyed the giant bamboo and the massive Javan fig tree. The weather in April was warm but pleasant, and there were plenty of shaded areas to rest. We packed some snacks and had a lovely little picnic on the grass. It’s also a great spot for photography—every corner has something unique to offer. Highly recommend this place for families, nature lovers, or anyone looking to spend a peaceful day outdoors. Give yourself at least 2–3 hours to explore fully. Tip: Wear comfortable shoes, bring water, and try to visit early in the morning or late afternoon to avoid the midday heat. Arrived here with our guide and had a lovely walk around the gardens, wild monkeys roam around the gardens and provide some entertainment. There is also a large number of fly foxes who hang out in the trees down by the river who made a really loud squeaking noise. The gardens are beautiful and particularly liked the orchid displays This is a must see in Kandy. There is a big variety of plants and what impressed me the most was that not only is the names of the plants/trees shown, but also the country of origin. We spend about 3 hours there but if you have time you can spend the whole day. The layout is also good and interesting in some instances. There are better botanical displays elsewhere in the world. Even Kew Gardens in the UK is better. It’s a shame really as they have a good climate here for things to flourish well. It’s something to do whilst in Kandy, but I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone coming to Sri Lanka. If you're travelling to Kandy, visiting these gardens is a must. They are beautiful. A nature-lovers dream. Fabulous botanical gardens, very well maintained and a must see when visiting Kandy. The variety of trees, plants and fauna are amazing, we followed the path along the river and came to the suspension bridge at the top, then made our way back towards the orchid house. Approx an hour and a half. Beautiful gardens, very well kept, not cheap tickets, but worth the price if you are interested in trees, that are the main attraction. The orchid glasshouse was a bit of a delusion because there weren’t any particular varieties. The Royal Botanical Garden in Peradeniya, Kandy, is one of the most desirable places on the island. It is home to more than 13,000 different species of plants, some unique to the island itself. A place to truly desire mother nature and to spend quality time with your loved ones Make sure you have set aside at least two hours - there is a lot to see and considerable ground to cover.  A guide is not essential and though you will see sights familiar from home there are also exceptionally rare plants and flowers, all in perfect condition and set against majestic lawns and avenues of elegant palms.  There is a photo opportunity at every juncture.  Simply stunning and well worth the modest entrance fee. Excellent visit with a private guide extremely knowledgeable and interesting. It is a must when in Kandy. When in the garden must visit the orchard house, well presented with many species. Every time we go anywhere near Kandy we visit the Royal Botanical Gardens at Peradeniya and spend an hour walking through them. As usual and as expected, they were excellent. You don't have to be a dedicated gardener to enjoy these gardens. Trees are labelled according to whether they're native, imports, even poisonous- so don't lick these ones! We had our guide with us, and he had a lot of knowledge about some of the plants and trees, that we may have missed if we'd been by ourselves. The mahogany trees are spectacular- the root system is about a metre high. The Cannonball tree looks like it has coconuts, but they weigh about 4kg. The palm trees lining one path are huge, and the little ones in between them are the same type, but look different when they're younger. We saw flying foxes, a water monitor, birdlife, and there's an orchid house, and a small suspension bridge. We were here a few hours, and it was a very pleasant visit. Well recommended. These gardens are fabulous, beautifully laid out and well kept. Wonderful variety of plants, and saw monkeys playing in the giant bamboo. Well worth the visit. Quiet and peaceful. Had a good walk through the gardens. There are several unique plants in the garden. The orchids were OK but there were not as many that I heard about. The Botanical Gardens are definitely one of the highlights of a stay in Kandy.   If you are short of time take a 1 hour tour in a golf buggy with a local guide (1000 rupees) The guy we had was incredibly knowledgeable and showed us all sorts of plants and birds that we would have probably missed by just walking around on our own.   The fruit bats high up in the tree tops are fascinating.  Many of the wonderful trees have been planted by visiting dignitaries and our guide knew the date everyone was planted. This garden was a welcome stop after hours of transport and tumult amid the noise of Kandy. A remarkable vestige of the British era, perfectly maintained, with beautiful discoveries. An impression of order and tranquility that contrasts so much with what awaits you outside. Loved this place! Great relaxing few hours spent here wandering around in theses fabulous gardens. There was lots of wildlife too including peacocks, monkeys and bats! Lots of areas of shade providing a welcome relief from the heat. Do check out the suspension beige too. A wide range of plants many of which have been planted by dignitaries from all over the world. The orchids are spectacular. The whole area is well kept and is a great place to spend a relaxing afternoon. One of the best maintained botanical gardens ever visited. If you are interested in the plant life scientifically , or just want to spend some good time in middle of best possible flora, this is the place to be. It's huge, so keep at least 3 hours to be spent here. Secondly, follow the map strictly, else u can easily lose track of places visited. Involves a lot of walking,  so not recommended for very young kids. They also have an option of hiring golf cart, but not sure about the prices. The Royal Botanical Garden is a must visit when in Kandy, it is vast and offers plenty of shade on hot days, beautifully kept and looked after. An amazing range of plants and trees and just a very tranquil place to be, make sure to set aside a morning or afternoon as it’s not a quick visit or better still take a picnic and go for the day. Stunning. We thoroughly enjoyed our day walking around these stunning gardens which are beautifully kept. Allow a good 3-4 hours to see everything. There are plenty of seating areas dotted around if you need a rest as well as some picnic areas and a restaurant.  We got caught in a tropical storm and used the time to have a lovely buffet lunch in the restaurant for a reasonable 950 rupees per person.  It was a very enjoyable day out. We could have spent the whole day here. Such beautiful mature trees, palms, shrubs and flowers and so well kept. There are lots of shad d places to sit down in when you are a bit frazzled with the sun. It is worth going. My favourite was the memorial garden area with trees planted by past and present world leaders and famous figures from history. The flying foxes are also a must-see. We visited this beautiful botanical garden on our way to Nuwara eliya from Kandy on a morning. It was very calming experience and got the chance to identify lot of new plants most of them native to Sri Lanka. it was a well maintained park where you can go and spend the time relaxingly. lot of space for children to run around and have fun. However, try to visit in a morning and on a less crowdy day. I think this park is very beautiful place in our country ,the value here is high for several reasons .Things like  orchid house ,avenue of palms ,Bamboo collection ,cannonball tree ,herbal garden .lake ,memorial trees ,can be seen here .so enjoy the beauty here ,. Well worth spending a couple of hours here as they are truly lovely. The orchid house is especially nice but the collections of bamboo, the herb garden but mainly the general fantastic layout of the garden. A must do while you are in Kandy Beautiful place where you can choose to take your time and walk around or you can go on the mini buses and get off at whatever stops you want. Very nice if you have a spare hour or two. superb gardens. very neat and clean and lots of walking paths. the views are pictuesque and the feel is very good. must visit place I love the peace and tranquility of the Royal Botanical Gardens. The plants, Mameluke and birds help to create a haven of calm amidst the frantic hustle and bustle that is Sri Lankan traffic. For me a must visit. I read people complaining that foreigners pay more than locals. What a good idea, pity we don’t do that in the U.K. A massive park with lots area to walk around for kids and to sit and relax,lots for types of trees and flowers and we'll maintained If you taking food and have it inside have to be careful with the monkeys The gardens are well worth a visit! The orchid house is great and the gardens very peaceful. Expect to spend a good 4 or 5 hours exploring the beauty! Great place to explore with kids. Nature at it’s best. Well maintained park with lush green park for children to play and explore different plants. A beautifully kept garden with delights around every corner. Exotic flowers and towering trees. Near a busy  road and with a stream of people entering we were surprised to  find areas where we were alone and there was silence. 3000 Rupees to enter for foreigners. One can hire a golf buggy to be driven around if mobility is poor. We enjoyed the topiary hedges, there was a deserted maze, orchid house, rose garden and so much more we did not  have time to see. Many birds we haven’t seen anywhere else , monkeys, bats and a mongoose. Allow two to three hours. Toilets are dire. kandy at its best nicely maintained one of the best places to visit for nature lovers. the restaurants need more quality & bit over priced for foreigners. have a paid buggy tour Really beautiful park, with loads of of trees (some really uncommon), flowers and animals. Was able to spot a few animals, such as bats (in huge number), squirrels, snakes and birds. Probably the best attraction in Kandy area. The entrance fee is expensive LKR2000 per person. There are many different species of of trees. They are beautifully line-up. There is also a section of plants planted and donated by foreign delegates. A indoor orchids orchard. Beware, there are a few trees full of bat's hanging and flying around. Go early as the sun climbs higher, it can get very hot. It is a fantastic beautiful and well-maintained garden with a large number of different trees, palms, bushes and plants. There is also a lilies restaurant (Royal Botanical Cafeteria) that serves a small buffet but it is not the one you should visit the garden for. It is unbelievable unless u read the pamphalet and check the dates...it is about 600+ years old garden and still maintained so well. Though they have Holf carts to take you around on nominal charges but the best way to explore this garden is buy walking around. Its not even difficult as there are benches arou d everywhere to sit and relax when u get tired. The river and the shaky bridge on it is really a great attraction in the park. A must visit site when in Srilanka. Well worth a visit.  Huge garden to wander around and admire the vast and varied trees and plants in the garden all of which are well maintained.  Particularly impressed by the orchid house.  Added bonus are the monkeys and bats to add life to the garden. Park is lovely and peacefull. Do not bother to order sri lankan omelette in cafeteria. U get only bland omelette with few bits of tomato. Asked about it from waitress. They just throwed me a loads of chili on different plate next to omelette. Been in Sri Lanka 1 month and this is definetly the Worst customer experience this far. After a morning in the crazy streets of Kandy, it was lovely to get away from it all and visit the gardens. They are quite expansive and if you have a problem walking then there is a golf buggy type vehicle that goes around the gardens. I do not know how often they operate but the trip lasts about an hour. Best ask at ticket office. There is a cafe overlooking the expansive lawns about 5 minutes after the entrance and this is a good place to plan your route with the map provided as you enter. The soft drinks were reasonably priced 160 for a  Sprite and the cafe has some very clean bathrooms. The gardens are peaceful and whilst there are many more impressive botanical gardens around the world this is a pleasant way to spend couple of hours. Peradeniya Royal Botanical Garden is located few kilometers away from Kandy city Sri Lanka. This ancient flower garden is home to authentic fauna and floras. You can get ralaxe at this calm environment. You can easily spend the half day there. The exhibition has a high variety of local and global plants. We absolutely recommend to go there if you have time. A visit to the Botanical Gardens should be at the top of your To Do list here in Kandy.  It’s worthwhile paying for a buggy ride around the Gardens as there is much to see and the guide will point out many things you might otherwise miss.  It’s also hot, so the breeze as you drive is refreshing. Nice beautiful cool place in hot Sri Lankan hot weather. Natural cools air will full of oxyzen lot of flowers and trees We could easily have spent all day here. Peaceful, quiet but beautiful. The variety of plants is amazing. Originally a royal pleasure garden  but laid out by the British in 1824. Look pout for the flying foxes!! This is a must do in Kandy. Can easily spend 2-3 hours here just walking around and admiring the nature. Go in the morning as it is cooler and more pleasant to walk around. Do not miss the monkeys, fruit bats and suspension bridge. Really well kept - kudos to the managememt. I was so impressed at every turn. This is a place not be missed. There are so many exotic species, endemic , native, and toxic species all color coded. I found wandering the outside regions instead of the orchid house more interesting personally. They had a large collection of cacti and succulents and incredible old huge trees. AN umbrella or at least a sun hat was important when we went. We had a trolley drive and stop so that we were able to cover more of the park. This is a wonderful place to spend several hours. A well maintained garden , this place was a pleasure to visit and a nice break from the hustle and bustle of town. We spent only 2 hours there but you could easily wander around longer. Plenty of paths and open space, information boards etc. The Plant House and Orchid House were the favourites as they were of interests to us; with many similar plants in our home. Another big tick for this garden is the section where world leaders had planted a tree and we could see how much the tree has grown from then.... A recommended visit ! Quite possibly the biggest gardens I’ve ever seen. Everything was beautiful and well maintained with some of the biggest plants I’ve ever seen. Would definitely recommend using the restrooms at the entrance as there are not many modern restrooms once you enter the garden. Her you can have a relaxed walk and see nice trees, plants but also bats and monkeys. There were many school children at the entrance but in the park there was sufficient space so it was not crowded Impressive collection of Trees from all over the World. A pleasant afternoons' diversion from the mayhem of downtown Kandy. The tree collection is quite spectacular. The Orchid House the Rose Garden etc were a little disappointing. That said I have never seen such a range of tree specimens. The Palm avenue and the Giant Bamboo trees are awesome. Well worth a visit for a couple of hours. More interesting than Kandy itself This is a very large, well maintained garden with lots to see as you wander around. You’ll need at least a couple of hours for a quick tour. There is quite a bit of renovation going on so some places are closed. It costs 2000 rupees for foreigners to get in. Street vendors aren’t allowed in so your visit will be relaxed and hassle free. We didn’t visit at the best time of year in terms of flowers, but it was lovely nonetheless. The rain didn’t spoilt our visit here, when we spent a few hours in these beautiful botanical gardens. Impressive orchids and awe inspiring trees and flowers. So many gardeners keep this place immaculate. But I will never forget the hundreds of huge fruit bats hanging in the trees! When they took to flight ... it was scary! Beautiful site from start to finish. Unfortunately we could not get an electric car to tour the park, and did most of 63 acres of it on foot in 35 degree heat. However, the majestic trees provide much needed shade and it did not seem too strenuous after all. Many trees have been planted by dignitaries of times past, such as King George and Queen Mary of England in 1901. Queen Elizabeth II also visited twice, in 1954 and in 1981. We found the experience very fulfilling and learned about many previously unknown trees and plants. Monkeys add a funny aspect to the experience. Just mind you don’t leave your bag on the floor. Very good toilet facilities. Highly recommended. Nice place to go to get away from the hustle and loudness of the city for a few hours.  Probably wouldn’t make a special trip there to go.  Beware of the scammers in the park who work there.  They will call you over and tell you to follow them to quiet part of the park tell you to look at the tree like they are an expert and then ask for money.  The first time we fell for it thinking this guy had something valid to tell us about the tree.  The second and third time just politely declined.  But all over the park we saw other tourists being conned in the same way.  Being led down the paths away from the main path.  Not only do you pay considerably more to get in than local people, you are then extorted by the workers once inside.  Beware If you are in Kandy you must go to the Royal Garden, it's amazing, you can have a picnic in one of the parks, have a nice walk through the day and enjoy the shade with the breeze. Just one advise, in one of the paths, there are a lot of bats so be careful when you walk through that part or avoid it. They don't do anything but just in case you are afraid. Nice place to spend a day. Better go when it is not too hot. A lot of things to do - can spend even whole day in there. These gardens are a must see in Kandy - they are absolutely beautiful...the flying fox bats by the river were spectacular... This is an excellent botanical site. I would suggest allowing a morning or afternoon to undertake a full visit. We benefited from a guide who could tell you about the various trees etc. A visit to the orchid house is a must. Beautiful gardens, apart from amazing plants there are also monkeys and gigantic bats there! We spent about 3 hours wandering around but it'd be easy to spend an entire day there if one has the time. The entry fee is 2000 rupees for an adult and 1200 for a student and they honour student's cards from all over the world. It is a beautiful place well worth going to. It is better to go first thing in the morning and see it without people, which then gets very crowded. There are all kinds of trees These are very well organised and set up gardens. Some very interesting specimens, and thousands of flying foxes fruit bats (24 thousand apparently). There are regular small bus tours around the grounds which would be worth taking, or simply stroll around yourself. This park is gorgeous! It's one of my favourite places in the world because it's extremely beautiful and very well-kept. Plus, if you enjoy being in contact with nature, I'm sure you will love spending some time here! One of the main attractions in Kandy.  Entrance fees are 2000 Rps per person. If, like us your time is more limited you can hire a golf buggy for another 2000 Rps (although unfortunately you can't drive it yourself!!).  The guide will point out trees planted by various celebrities and royalty.  Although, I don't think this does the gardens justice and, in retrospect, would have preferred to wander through the pathways and enjoy them at a more sedate pace. As well as all the interesting trees, plants and orchids you can see monkeys and fruit bats. If you really want to do full justice to this place you need 2-3 hours as it's a huge botanical garden with variety of trees, flowers and birds. The garden is well maintained and there's also a buggy service if you don't want to walk the entire garden area. What i loved most is the orchid garden, the cactii garden, the Rose garden, lovely trees in various natural shapes and the way different plants are laid to bring our the beauty. There are plenty of nature’s delights here. Firstly, the trees are magnificent and there are so many different species, many are endemic. Secondly, you can see a number of colourful birds here. Thirdly, how about the huge red fruit bats that fill the trees in their hundreds! Not to mention the macaques which roam the gardens looking for scraps. There is also a very good cafe which has good value buffet food. If you need to get back to Kandy when your visit is over, and you are fed up haggling with tuktuk drivers, just jump on the bus and pay a few rupees (around 9 pence). Brilliant place. Visited here on Jan 21st,2019. This garden is more floral than the Hakgala botanical gardens. Plenty of couples and white skinned foreign tourists here. You can also pay extra to sit in a buggy and see the place with live commentary and photo stops by the driver - which we did here. Since it is quite large if you plan on covering it by foot/walk then plan to easily spend at least 4 hours here. a garden with a huge variety of plants, some not even available in other parts of the world.  a very enjoyable walk and the gardens even had an orchid flower house with different varieties of orchids. This type of visit is generally not to my liking, so I was pleasantly surprised to have enjoyed it quite so much. It was included on our Tour itinerary, but I believe entry was about £7 equivalent & well worth it. A tranquil place, despite the large number of visitors. We saw the fruit bats in flight, visited the Orchid house, saw the tree plaques with plantings by many famous personages etc. Our guide was very knowledgeable & this enhanced the trip. Depending on your level of interest, one could spend most of a day here. The gardens are superb and great quiet place to relax. The gardens are very well cared for and we highly recommend a visit WOW. What a place. Beauty everywhere. Superb arrangements. Nice walking experience. Bridge is a little bit adventurous too. Very soothing. We luckily had a very good weather as well. This is a beautiful location to visit on a warm, sunny day. It is a moderately large park so one has the option of having a great walk but there is also a shuttle bus that moves from one important part of the park to another (at an added cost above and beyond the price of entry). There are many amazing sections including imported species of trees and flowers from other parts of SE Asia and even South America. The orchid building is wonderful to visit, albeit it a little hot and humid. There are a large number of bats in the trees as well as birds. A very peaceful place to visit after the intensity of the surrounding city. A beautiful place to spend a couple of hours away from the hustle and bustle of Kandy... giant bamboo... lakes..monkeys and bats. So big it can’t really be crowded... calm and tranquil Tourism in Sri Lanka is being affected by a disappointing two-tier system that shows no respect for foreign visitors at attractions, 3000rs for foreigners and a fraction of the price for locals. This problem is reflected in the declining number of returning tourists. Despite having visited the country many times over the last 13 years with my Sri Lankan wife and her family, I have not seen any improvement in this situation, only a rise in costs. As someone who has visited many botanical gardens, I must say that this one is mediocre at best. The only highlight for me was watching the fruit bats. I have visited the garden as a teenager many times while living in Sri Lanka. After more than 30 years living abroad, I decided to take my teenagers to show this amazing place. It is very disappointing that they charge more than $40usd while the locals pay less than $1. Don’t get me wrong, this a very beautiful place but a steep cost for a family. Wonderful gardens with all sorts of birds monkeys and large fruit bats. The tour in the golf buggy was wonderful and very welcome if you're a bit dodgy on your pins. The driver was also knowledgeable friendly and amusing. They don't have enough 3 seater buggies so you have to be lucky or pushy to get one. A pity they don't have more benches so that you can just and ponder. Lots of history. it was a hot day but the gardens did not disappoint.  A favorite place for wedding photography we were lucky to see three separate brides and grooms in the short time we were there.  There is a lot to see and a lot we didn't realize was on site. It would pay to do a bit more research before you go so you make effective use of your time. Entrance fee of 1000 KLR pp cash only no credit cards accepted.  This is quite a cheap outing. Beautifully kept, very well laid out gardens with many species of trees, plants, shrubs and grasses. Giant Bamboos, many varieties of palms, huge trees. Tree lined avenues and riverside walk. Nice way to enjoy 2hrs relaxing in the open air. The entrance fee for tourists is 1500 rupee each, and they give you a map of the walks and locations of plants. There are free toilets, water points, and shops inside selling food and drinks so don’t panic if you aren’t prepared. The whole place is amazing and has such wide varieties of plants. You can get lovely photos like on Instagram at the palm tree walks and the large open green is great to sit in the shade part way through your walks and get your energy back for the rest. We leisurely walked around and stayed inside circa 2-3 hours, but if you were very interested I’m sure 4 hours would be plenty. There are TUK TUK drivers outside, as ours didn’t want to wait, but please note they will ask a premium to get back to Kandy but we just asked a few and one was wiki f to take us back for 300 rupee rather than 700. The Botanical Gardens were very impressive in terms of content and scope.  A lovely way to spend a morning or afternoon.  Lovely bedding, impressive hot houses, especially the Orchid House and the Plant Room.  Everything was beautifully manicured.  Watch out for the giant palms and the giant bats!  Take your camera! This garden serves as both a leisure park and a biological resource. It is popular but huge. It is located a short distance out of Kandy but travel is slow. It is largely open but there are areas of shade.  Plants are largely well labelled.  A good map is provided.  Polythene is not permitted Th Royal Palm walk is splendid but there are many other interesting features. The orchid house is interesting and colourful. Dont miss the Javanese figs with their huge roots. Dont miss the numerous fruit bats in the northern area.  There is quite a lot of birdlife too. Excellently maintained gardens and Orchid House. Leisurely stroll around the stunning flora. Helps to have a knowledgeable guide but not a necessity. Must see when visiting the area. large , well designed garden with beautiful collection trees and flowers. Especially the tree collection is impressing.I  couldn’t see everything as my driver was waiting. Most of all it is very very well kept. next best to me with the « jardins de pamplemousse » on Mauritius. tip : go urly in  the morning as it  gets stickier around noon After the busy city centre we visited this beautiful botanical garden. It was so peaceful and quiet, we could relax. We enjoyed walking the exotic and special trees, plants and flowers. My favourite part was the orchid house. I think it’s a must-see site for nature-lovers. My wife and I enjoyed a lovely casual stroll around the gardens on a sunny afternoon. The gardens are amazing with so many different species and variety of plans to see and admire. You can enjoy watching the monkeys play here too there are a lot of them around the trees and you can also see many flying squirrels here too. Well worth going here to chill and take a break. We arrived early in the morning and were lucky to get a golf buggy and guide for an additional 1000rps. This helped us cover more than 5km of the beautiful gardens and ensured that we managed to see all the highlights within about an hour. Our guide was lovely! super friendly and informative and gave us good insight into the gardens history and fauna and flora. The entrance fee is 2000rps per person which is very reasonable considering the immaculate condition the garden is kept in. This is a must for nature lovers, photographers and artists! Must visit place do take Electric car as lot of walk is involved as Shuttle is also available at good price but you have to wait for a long for availability ...and then we found wow... suspension bridge..orchid houses..flower garden.. etc Peradeniya Botanical Garden is a must-visit for nature lovers. The sprawling grounds are filled with historical trees, stunning flowers, and inviting lawns. While the entry fee for foreigners (3000 LKR) is significantly higher than for locals (200 LKR), the experience is well worth it. Just be mindful of the monkeys that can be found in certain areas and take necessary precautions to avoid any unwanted encounters. Overall, Peradeniya Botanical Garden offers a peaceful and enchanting escape from the hustle and bustle of the city. This is a very nice botanical garden, with many beautiful flowers in the garden, and a great collection of orchids. There is a pleasant relaxed atmosphere, and we could easily have spent more time there. Beautiful gardens and extensive grounds all immaculately kept .Easy to follow route around main sights and we particularly enjoyed the beautiful orchid house. Nice botanical garden, but very expensive compared to the place. There is a price for locals and a price for foreigners. A true oasis and escape from the businesses of the city. The gardens are well cared for a lovely way to while away around three hours in leafy greenness. Many notable and interesting plants and trees. A lovely escape from the madness of Kandy, Highly recommended to visit. We spent 3 hours walking around the site. Plenty of shade, but if you can try and get there by 9am We liked, in particular the museum, the orchid house and the three avenues of pine, coconut and palm trees. The royal circle was interesting, checking out the many trees planted by dignitaries and royalty over the years. The herbal garden was disappointing and needs upgrading and the two cafes not great either. However we spent a good few hours checking out some amazing trees and flora and learning about the history of the gardens Royal Botnical Gardens in Kandy is the most beautiful place in Sri Lanka. It appears you have entred a dreamland with beautiful flowers all around. A must visit during your Sri Lanka trip Around 6km to the west of Kandy.  Overall these gardens are somewhat tired and neglected.  We have visited a number of botanical gardens around the world including in the tropics and these are typically free to enter or the entry price is reasonable.  The entry price for foreigners at Peradeniya is LKR2,000 per person, which is not far off what you would pay for far superior gardens in Europe.  I have no problem with foreigners being charged more than locals but the price charged should be reasonable and it would be good to see the money generated being invested in the site. We loved the botanical gardens. It's beautiful, lots of open space as well as different themed houses. The orchid house was really nice. There's monkeys towards to back near the bamboo which were really cute to see. There's a little shop just outside for snacks and drinks. We spent 1.5 hours in the gardens but could have easily done longer. Lots of shaded areas to get out the sun. Very nice botanical garden with beautiful and impressive trees and very nice layout. Just follow the numbers on the map for an excellent walk for several hours. Not so many plants to see and a few flowers this time of the year but still some very fantastic views and a lot of benches and spots just to sit and enjoy the scenery. Bring some food of your own for a picknick as the restaurant is below par compared to the beautiful surroundings. Hi, Its located very hill country close to Kandy city. 100Km far from airport and nearly 3 hours direct driving. The large botanical garden with real relaxing with enjoyable visit. More Eco hotels,star class hotels , restaurants and shopping , religious and many more activities near was their.Half day can spend better in morning & evening . Also  Temple of Tooth ,Pinnawala Elipahant Orphanage & Kadugannawa crossing in additional location to cover same tour. Thanks. I will begin by saying that I've been to more than my share of overpriced attractions in Asia. This garden, if you are a fan of gardens that is, is worth the 1500 LKR entrance fee. The place is absolutely huge, rubbish free, and very well maintained. I wandered around for 3 hours and could have spent longer there. I've certainly seen better collections of specific types of plants, but the overall collection on display here, and the overall feel of the place was special. One minor criticism - I would have loved to see an orchid display 10 times the size of what they currently have (think Singapore's garden). You know they grow here, let's show them off! The day I visited there were dozens of students on a school assignment mingling among the foreign visitors, engaging them in conversation as they practiced speaking English. It was refreshing to see their enthusiasm and I was more than happy to take time to chat with them. Heaven on Earth. It is hard to imagine this wonderful place. 4000 trees from all over the world, 200 years old The vast expanse of trees are laid out over 60 hectares . See trees , orchids that you may have never seen before. A place where nature lovers like us can spend the whole day, away from noise and crowds. Neat and clean and the only sounds you hear are of birds. Next time we will spend a whole day here . The botanical gardens are well worth a visit. Very well maintained grounds. You can take a buggy around however there is no English commentary. A few more English signs on the trees and plants would go over well. The gardens are perfectly maintained, being Sunday they met so many families who played, couples walking. The park has trees from all over the world, monkeys, orchids, a small spice garden, many colorful flower beds and towards the bottom of the park a natural spectacle: thousands of flying foxes!! Absolutely recommended We love nature and taking a walk, but the Royal Botanical Garden is a 5* experience. Words don’t describe well, so see pictures Peradeniya Botanical Garden, a, is renowned for its extensive collection of flora and its stunning landscape.  very beautifully place These gardens are offering countless species of local exotic flora. My favorite was royal palms, memorial trees and house of orchids but that is just a tiny part of what you can run into there. Reserve few hours and about about 1500lkr for this large area that is an ideal place for walks and relax. Botanical Garden was the first attraction which we visited in our trip to Sri Lanka .our tour leader told about the garden history that every one knows about it and I dont want to repeat here . in fact the garden is beautiful and is a must seen in Sri Lanka , around two hour should be allocated for this attraction in your plan . there are wonderful landscapes for  memorable  photos . no doubt should be visited on sunny days . there are some kiosks inside to buy ice cream , water , fruit juice ,.... highly recommended to visit but take care of monkeys that may attack for food ,... A great botanical garden. Many species unique to Sri Lanka. A nice place to stroll. It is quite large and provides a quiet space to get away from the noise and crowds of Kandy. A lovely afternoon visit to the gardens. They are very spacious and have particularly interesting sections including the cycads, giant bamboo, cabbage palm Avenue and orchid house. Wish we had take a picnic, as the vibe would be perfect to sit and relax for an afternoon in the sun. There is a small cafe with a limited selection and clean toilets. Also a discount on entry to students (foreign). They may not be the greatest gardens you'll ever see but as we had a morning to fill in, a nice long walk through the gardens was perfect before continuing on our road trip through Sri Lanka. For once we didn't have our heads buried in a guide book, we just roamed and discovered as we went, including a very nice cafe that made VG coffee. The gardens are big and nicely laid out, another legacy of the British Colonial era. The air was fresh, nice and cool in the morning and very relaxing. Four of us enjoyed another visit to the excellent gardens but noted that, due to the current Covid-19 problems, the number of visitors were greatly reduced. This made our visit even more personal. This is a really attractive large park in the town of Kandy, full of wonderful trees, shrubs and plants, many from different parts of the world. Entry is relatively cheap and I would suggest paying a little extra to tour the park with a driver on one of the electric buggies (it is very hot to walk around and explore the whole park - there's a lot to see and the drivers are quite knowledgeable). Most of the trees etc. have descriptive plaques, and you'll notice from the information that many were planted by famous people, some over a hundred years ago. In one area in some fir trees, you'll almost certainly see roosting bats, which was quite a surprise. The Royal Palm avenue is very nice too. Don't miss the Orchid House near the entrance before you leave. Very good. As a seasoned tour guide with over a decade of experience in showcasing the best of Sri Lanka, the Peradeniya Botanical Garden remains one of my favorite places to take visitors. This sprawling garden, nestled near Kandy, is a haven for nature lovers and offers a unique glimpse into the island’s rich botanical heritage. Went at 9am to avoid the crowds although the temperature was low 30's. Great shaded walkways. Well laid out, easy to follow on the given map. Tree signage brilliant with signage making you aware of the poisoness trees and who planted what. Don't miss it if you visit Kandy. If you have limited time, I would recommend you get the electric buggy around the gardens, for a small extra charge (equivalent to about £1 each).  It's a large site and you get to see a lot of it in the buggy. Other groups had their personal guides with them and got a lot more out of it than we did, as ours didn't come in with us.  But is was pleasant to be taken round and see the different types of flora and fauna.  We also saw the house where Lord Mountbatten stayed during part of the 2nd World War. For us this was the highlight of our visit to Kandy.  The gardens are excellent.  Beautifully laid out, well documented and surprisingly peaceful. They compare very favourably with Kew and those in Madeira.  You do not need to be heavily into gardening or a botanist to enjoy these gardens - just relax and walk. One word of caution.  It can be very hot, though there is a lot of shade.  Take plenty of water, or, if the heat is problem, use the buggy for a guided tour. One of our favourite stops during our visit to Sri Lanka, these historic gardens are impressive, and beautifully maintained. Featuring trees, plants and flowers from all over the world, it is a testament to the curiosity of British settlers who first established them (and the to sustained commitment of the Sri Lankan government to preserving the site. Lovely grounds to stroll, with many spots providing cooling shade to escape the often oppressive heat. We spent a few hours roaming, and saw perhaps half of the park. The orchid house is s highlight, as are the tree-lined pathways featuring particular species (double coconuts, royal palms, etc). Plan 2-3 hours for your stay. Otherwise you'll either have to hurry or can't see everything. Can recommend the gift shop. The selection is quite good and the prices are low (e.g. 100-200 RS for a magnet). So Green. Beautiful gardens. Instead of feeding squirrels we found ourselves spotting chipmunks and feeding monkeys! Great water features and plenty of plants (including giant bamboo) to get lost in. I recently visited the Royal Botanical Gardens. What a great experience w. The gardens are extensive and was so relaxing to walk around. Very nice gardens and very big, they have a lot of different species of plants and flowers. Also a chance to see a lot of birds and other animals. In the trees you can see hundreds of flying foxes We went back and forth on whether to stop here on our way into Kandy, since we only had one night in the city and it's pretty hot to walk around the gardens in the middle of the day. In the end we did stop, and we're very glad we did. You don't need that long in Kandy, and Peradeniya was certainly more interesting than anything in Kandy. It takes 2 or 3 hours to wander around. There's a lot of great plants and trees, but also birds and a large number of bats towards the back of the gardens. This botanical garden houses rare doule coconut trees, fragrant orchid collection, palm way and spice garden to name a few. We spent almost 3-4 hours at this spot. I have visited the ""Royal Botanical Garden"" twice and like to see again and again. There are so many local plants, trees and foreign plants also. Very attractive place is the Orchid Garden, you can see so many Orchid flowers in it. I would like to thanks the staff of toilets cleaning, because they doing their job very well and so many cafes also are there. Recommended for full day or half day-outing trip here. This about 3 miles west of Kandy. It has many plants  and many orchids and palm trees. The National Herbarium is attached. It goes back to  1371 under King Wickramananu Great day out with my mum, was very peaceful and relaxing to walk around, the greenhouses were beautiful, however not many flowers were outside due to the time of year, so would defiantly come back in summer time to see the flowers. We booked last minute and got discount online so would defiantly recommend booking online! However the orangery restaurant was awful!!!! Would not recommend, floors were disgusting, food was over priced, waitresses looked unhappy, coffee from machine was disgusting and the doors were constantly being left open making it cold inside! So that’s the only bad thing I would say. Overall the gardens were beautiful. An amazing place close to the bustling city. We spent 2 hours there, refreshing both mind and body. Beautiful plants and greenhouses. We fed little monkeys that run freely in the garden and enjoyed the shade of the trees. We walked through the entire park on foot, but saw that you can also rent golf carts. For tourist who have visited similar parks in other parts of the world can avoid this.  The entry fee of LKR 2,000 for foreigners is not at all justified.  Its a waste of time and energy.  The only impressive part was the Orchid collection which had a few beautiful flowers.  The part is anyways well laid out and well kept.  You will find a lot of local couples romancing at secluded placed. If you do not get time to visit this location or avoid, you do not loose out on anything..  This is a very personal opinion.  Travelers who have lot of free time and money can definitely spend time here.  May be impressive for tourist from places with sparse vegetation. We visited here yesterday. It was 1500 rupees each and well worth the money. We went in over a suspension bridge which was quite bouncy but there is another entrance if you are not keen on that idea. We felt we didn’t have enough time here as we were meeting our driver and could have happily stayed another couple of hours. There is a cafe and an ice cream place in the centre. This is located close to Kandy and has a huge collection of trees. It is nicely laid out and has a lake in the center. There are trees from different parts of the world. The garden is well maintained and worth a visit. If you like your botany with a side order of Colonial history, and movie trivia, Kandy Botanical Gardens will suit you down to the ground! These gardens, a former Royal Garden dating back to the 14th century, are beautifully laid out but not in an overly formal style. The British turned it into a Botanical Garden in the19th century. A highlight of the visit was a guided tour led by Mr Bandara Palipana, the lead academic for the gardens and author of numerous books on the gardens and the flora of Sri Lanka (he will happily sell you one from a bundle he carries around with him!). Mr Palipana, a distinguished,older gentleman, full of anecdotes, took us on a tour of superlatives, showing us the oldest, biggest, most poisonous, most important, most beautiful, most beneficial, trees and plants. He also regaled us with tales of Royal visits by HM Queen Elizabeth and Lord Mountbatten who lived in a bungalow in the grounds, and the garden's role in the movie 'Bridge Over The River Kwai'. All in all, an absolute treat!. Slightly outside of Kandy with a not cheap entry price,especially for those that are accustomed to free access to parks, but well worth a visit. Wonderful place to while away several hours in a generally peaceful and interesting environment. There are lots of plants that were impressive (and a huge herd of bats) and that we’ve not seen before, and also interesting installations. Bring water - it gets hot and only some parts have shade. Lots of picnickers too. There is a shuttle that goes around as the grounds are really large. We decided to Visit the botanical gardens during our whistle stop tour of Kandy. We were not disappointed!! By far the best thing we did in Kandy. The gardens are a complete contrast to the busy city centre. Huge open spaces, very quiet and peaceful.... just don’t look up!!!!! About halfway through walking round/through the gardens, we looked up only to see 1000’s of bats the size of cats in the trees. Despite being harmless, it can be a little intimidating. Strongly recommend to anyone visiting Kandy. This has to be on your list of things to do. Excellent gardens to walk around, beautiful flowers and lots of information on route. Try the suspension bridge if you have a head for heights and watch your bags with the cheeky wild monkeys This botanical garden should not be missed on a tour of Sri Lanka. Such a amazing place and has wide varieties of plants. Well maintained. Air was fresh, nice and cool in the morning and very relaxing. A must do while you are in Kandy. A must visit garden , stunning , personally I wouldn't wear flip flops like I did , trainers etc perfect, a quick tuk tuk ride from central kandy , 1500 rupees. I loved this tranquil garden, The bats were my favorite. The gardens are 200years old and the trees amazing. I can truly recommend the botanical gardens. Visited for an afternoon and was a very pleasant stroll through lovely grounds. Tourists pay 2000rupees and you can hire a golf cart for an extra 2000 if you feel too hot too walk. They have a fantastic selection of trees which are nice and shady to sit under and there is a lovely cool cafeteria where you can sit and have lunch and soft drinks at reasonable prices. We only had an hour to enjoy this immaculate haven but we could have stayed for much longer. Every part of the garden was excellently kept. The highlights we found included the massive bamboo trees, the Orchid House and the Flower Garden. We were here around midday and found it to be very hot. I would recommend visiting at a cooler part of the day to really be able to take everything in. What a total waste of space and time. The Orchid House and the Rose Garden were totally pointless and disappointing. The local Garden Centre in the UK has a better range of both Orchids and Roses. So we gave up and went to the cafe in the middle was a welcome spot to sit and have a drink. There are virtually no seats in the garden to look and relax. We visited on a very hot day and there is not a lot of shade. Allow a couple of hours and go on the suspension bridge for photo. The orchid house is amazing there is such a variety of plants and trees. The fruit bats were interesting to see and we also saw lots of monkeys. Definitely needs to be on your itinerary when visiting Kandy. This isn't my usual field of interest, but we enjoyed it so much. We hired a golf cart to take us around, and the driver was so knowledgeable and entertaining. It's a lovely way to spend a few hours in the shade and quiet. The garden is huge and so we'll maintained. I love seing the aquirels and fruitbats especially We spent hours in this garden and if I had more time, I'd stay much longer. I loved this garden. It must have been the biggest I have been to in all my travels. The huge trees were extra special because of the history and their age. It is nice to find something like this at the heart of the city. Aside from plants, there are many animals roaming the garden so watch your belongings in case there are monkeys. They usually would not bother you but it's better to be sure. Wear comfortable footwear and clothes so you can cover the whole grounds. Located about 10-15 kms away from kandy city. Its a huge botanical garden thats been developing from the last 100 years or so. Its beautiful and its huge. U can just keep walking for hours. Theres so much to observe here. Though i have no idea about trees/plants, it was quite fascinating to see the variety of flora n fauna. The botanical garden is really well maintained.  I found d entrance fee of 2000 LKR for foreigners too much though. Thats a big hole in d pocket. So if ur ok to spend on d entrance ticket then it’s surely worth a visit. We spent an hour n half just enjoying d greenery n pleasant weather. This is a very nice and beautiful garden. It is a pretty large park so the best way to see it is by cart. This takes about an hour and cost is very little. Well worth the visit and a great way to fill in the day. A quiet spot in Kandy, with hundreds of plants, trees ... and monkeys. Many Orchids in gorgeous colours. A great way to spend time is a slow stroll through the entire grounds. Nice to find a seat and just enjoy the beauty and quiet. Another must-do when in Kandy. Beautiful gardens loved the orchids a truely peaceful place to spend some time . A lot of shady places to get out of the hot sun . Very expensive to visit here in off season. Nothing much to see in the month of jan... And not worth... These extensive gardens provide lush lawns on which children play, heaven in a crowded city. The maintenance and layout are quite good, but the plants and trees are not labeled which is a shame. Needless to say it was a massive spread of various plants and trees from around the world. Well maintained and clean with information on some of them which we found to be useful. Many tourists around due to its popularity though it could never get congested. A huge grassland in the middle gave our kids unimaginable space to play. Alongside was a cafe where I could only spot tourists,the locals were seated down on the grass with their modest meals. We sat around them too and couldn’t have enough of the fresh air that is usually missing in gulf counties. At 2000 LKR per adult it was worth our time and effort. Actually ""Kandy"" sounds so much nicer than it is, BUT: on our second day we visited the botanical garden and it was far beyond our expections. Its a huge areal to plan at least 3 hours for the visit. Surprised by amazing garden planning and well cared... One of the best botanical gardens I ever visited. The garden includes many species of plants, This garden is home to trees from every corner of the tropical atmosphere.it's a massive garden and would take few hours for site seen. electric buggies were available, inside the garden average price cafeteria serving Western and Sri Lankan food for hungry tunnies. washroom facilities were available in many locations,  if you want to purchase plants, there is a plant centre near to the main gate ( Open at 0830 ). Barista and Laksala anchored near to exit.dont missed this man-made piece of art, it is a haven in the haven. We were initially hesitant about a visit to the royal botanical gardens but overall it is a pleasant visit. We were focussing on a few displays that we were interested in. Firstly we went to see the giant bamboo forest which was amazing. We also went to take a look at the fig tree and the orchid house. It is well maintained but having more flowers would be good. An unmissable visit, these gardens are a true marvel! They are located a few kilometers from Kandy, easily reachable by bus or tuk tuk. Entrance price 3000 rupees Huge park, where you can spend no less than 3 hours walking among hundreds of species of tropical plants. The pearl is the orchid greenhouse, where you can admire wonderful flowers. Easy to spend a full afternoon here. Beautiful well kept gardens with lots of interesting trees and plants. There is an orchid house, suspension bridge and fruit bats along with cheeky monkeys who will take  food from your hand. But be warned, they can be slightly aggressive. The cafe is welcoming on a hot day. This was by far the highlight of our stay in Kandy. The gardens are stunning and there are so many plants and trees to take in. We enjoyed watching the fruit bats hanging from the trees. If you don’t have much time I would recommend prioritising the gardens. Royal Botanical Gardens are beautiful place with huge botanical diversity. You can walk along the paths here and admire different species of plants. This gardens have a large area so you can spend much time in this place and it isn't boring. Inside the gardens is really calm, you can relax, take a breathe and stay away from the noise of the city. Highly recommend! I always visit botanical gardens whenever possible, this one gave me the most pleasure! A huge variety of plants, a well-thought-out path layout, all plants with captions. A real English garden! You can rent a golf car, which will help you explore the garden in comfort. This tour really needs a buggy to get around but they don't have enough. had a very welcoming guide who took us to most of the 'important' places in the gardens Peradeniya Botanic Gardens is a unique gift of Mother Nature with its ancient yet beautiful landscape.  This garden will be of great use to biologists, as it is home to a wide variety of species.  It is also a perfect place for family, friends or lovers to relax and unwind on the go with their children.  Even Tulu Latha brings helpful bliss. In particular, the garden is ready to capture your beautiful moments and create beautiful views by looking around throughout the garden. No matter how reluctant you are to leave again with the freedom you enjoy throughout the park, you will have to limit your leisure activities to 5 pm whenever you enter the park grounds. Amazing trees and rare species. Good collection of orchids. Too bad we did not had a guide to explain the plants in the medicinal garden. Restaurant is very good. I recommand it. A rally lovely & relaxing place to visit with many areas to enjoy throughout the gardens, some fabulous views to enjoy. A lot of history too, to absorb. The variety & care taken for the upkeep is first rate. Ensure you allow yourself the time to properly enjoy this place. Views from the suspension bridge are fantastic as well as interesting engineering construction. These botanical gardens are so pretty. You just cant stop admiring nature. But the weather these days is so so hot. It ruins your trip. Better to take a buggy ride all around the park, else you might not be able to cover it all. Start late in noon so its some nice stroll. The bamboo plantation is just mesmerizing. Some very old trees, some trees planted by royal guests, spices trees area and a suspended bridge are some highlights where you should stop. P.s i was so amazed to find really clean restrooms! Overall a wonderful experience.  Calm and serene, this garden shows some amazing plants, trees, and flowers.  The orchid garden was particularly beautiful. Tip - use a buggy for covering this in an hour. Very well maintained botanic garden. Entry fees is on the higher side but still highly recommended to visit Approx 20 mins outside Kandy (very busy roads) this is a real treat for those who love gardens, trees, flowers and history. We went to the Botanical Garden a few days ago. We arrived at 8am before it got hot and crowded. We went on an hours buggy ride round the garden which was great as we were shown the main areas and special plants and then we were able to go back to the areas we wanted to see again. The orchid house was lovely and not to be missed. This massive garden was a joy to explore on a hot day as it was much cooler under the trees. There's a nice children education center that includes a whimsical maze area including a bunny hedgehog and more. Plan to spend time here. When you are in Kandy, you should definitely visit the gardens. You can easily spend a couple of hours there and see the amazing collection of trees, plants, etc. The kids also loved it! I had been really looking forward to visiting here and it did not disappoint! Beautiful trees, flowers, gardens, orchids and lots of opportunity to spot wildlife and birds. We arrived morning and walked anti- clockwise and found it very quiet as most people seemed to be going clockwise, I especially loved the walk down cabbage patch lane. Highly recommend a visit but take plenty of water, it is very hot! Located in Peradeniya, just 5.5km to the west of the city of Kandy and is renowned for its collection of orchids. The garden is home to more than 4000 species of plants, spices, medicinal plants and palm trees. You can explore the grounds on foot, however, if you’re feeling tired, or potentially lazy, golf carts can be rented. It costs 1500 LKR/person to enter the gardens. A perfect place to relax and take some great pictures, we spent about 2 hours here and went early in the morning to avoid crowds of people. You will need at least three hours in these gardens (we only managed to see about half). If you go right after you have entered visit the Orchid House and go further walking alongside the river look up to see the fruit bats. So many examples of trees, bamboos and palms, highly recommend a visit. This is Sri Lanka's main botanical gardens; as such we expected more (especially having see the equivalent in other Asian countries such as Singapore). Sri Lanka has a vast range of ""exotic"" plants native to the country - thus you would expect the botanical gardens to display them to the full - put simply, it doesn't. Well worth visiting, and well looked after. This place is amazing! I love plants and animals and visiting the beautiful gardens was perfect for me and my husband! You can see a lot of flowers, many types of trees from different parts of the world, friendly monkeys, big bats in the trees and many more. We also loved the orchid house. At the end of our visit, we stopped to the souvenir shop and bought incense sticks and some other local goods for our family and friends. The glowing reviews of the Botanical Garden baffle me.  Yes, it’s beautifully laid out, but labeling is miserable.  Upon entry, paying the massive foreigners’ fee – as if we’re some sort of different animal from Sri Lankans – visitors are given a map with such tiny print that it’s almost impossible to see.  The roads/paths aren’t marked on the map, and there’s no indication of the location of the flora featured on the pages adjacent to the map.  Some plants are labeled; most are not.  And the labels are pretty useless.  A large plot of dahlias, for example, are simply described as dahlias, no indication of the specific cross or the name of each plant.  It’s even worse in the orchid house, where the labels that would indicate the cross of the orchids, even the species name, are neatly hidden, and visitors are specifically admonished not to touch the plant labels.  So in the end the Botanical Garden offers a lovely stroll in an otherwise crowded city, but informative it most certainly is not. Lovely place to visit.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that my partner, one of the worlds leading agricultural crop plant pathologists, was very keen to visit the wild relatives of modern crops area.  Unfortunately, although this area is on the map it has been removed.  Aside from that a lovely place to spend a few hours.  The suspension bridge is not for the feint hearted! We loved walking through these gardens. They are beautifully landscaped with more than 4000 species of plants. They have a big collection of orchids too. The cannon ball tree was very fascinating. One can easily spend a couple of hours here without getting bored. But you have to be prepared to walk. The gardens are spread over a huge area. A really nice thing, I will say something that I already said about the ticket prices very finely, they are real thieves... then they will be surprised that they don't have tourists, then stop stealing... damn... ...this place is spectacular, it is wonderful, you can get lost for hours, plants of all kinds, trees, gardens, flowers... etc... Very well maintained gardens with beautiful flowers and trees.  A very pleasant afternoons walk around this large estate, Loved this wonderful place. Best thing of all was the golf cart we rented to get around as it was punishingly hot. The guide was knowledgeable and pointed out trees planted by notable people. The orchid house was the highlight but we also liked the three palm lined avenues and the lake. It was so quiet and calm here. We easily got a tuk tuk from our hotel to take us to the gardens. Entry fee is about $15 CDN each person. There is a coffee/gift shop at what is the entrance and the exit area. Public washrooms, which are very clean, are at the entrance and throughout the gardens. Can easily cover the gardens in 3 hours or less depending on what you wish to see and how fast you walk. Well maintained and a treat for any nature lover. We also saw a troop of monkeys and many beautiful birds. Get out of the noise and madness of the city and spend a wonderful couple of hours wandering these lovely gardens. Stunning flowers, awesome giant bamboo and the orchids are breathtaking. They are located just outside Kandy, in Peradenya, but with the chaotic traffic of the city it takes a while to arrive. They are very interesting if you have a guide who explains the different types of trees and plants. The greenhouse with the orchids and the avenues of Coco de Mer are wonderful. You can spend a couple of hours there in peace We stopped at the botanical gardens after visiting the Temple of the Tooth and it was a lovely way to end the day. The gardens are extensive so be prepared for a lot of walking (in the heat!)! Our guide arranged for a tour of the gardens for us and it was great, we got to see the whole area and the different varieties of plants, learn a little about the history of the gardens, and all without breaking a sweat! Definitely worth a visit if you are in the area. Large botanical gardens that are doing great work alongside Kew gardens amongst others. Some great tree species to see from around the world , as well as beautiful flowering plants. Loved the avenue of palms, the large , old mahogony tree and the Madagascan 'canon ball tree' with its beautiful fruits shaped like cannon balls and its beautiful flowers. Well laid out, well sign posted and very well maintained. You will probably need 3 hours plus to see it all. Although there is shade , it was hot walking around so take plenty of water. There is a cafe , ideally located by the large lawn if you want to stay longer/ are in need of refreshments. Botanical Gardens outside Kandy. Not very well looked after, very large and with lots of plants. Worth a visit if you have time to spare. Not normally my cup of tea but everyone spoke to recommended it after a long drive and visit to the tooth temple and tbh I wasn’t disappointed! Very well kept vast gardens with many points of interest and some beautiful floral arrangements ! FABULOUS. I had a great few hours here. Amazing. The trees etc were spectacular. The cheeky monkeys roaming around watching for an opportunity. Magical place. Well worth a visit. Very well maintained. Sch a variety of things to see. Camera fanatics would love this. Great verity of trees, plants and flowers. I could see acres and acres of greenery.  It takes at least a day to see it all. Nice place to relax. Nice place to picnic and enjoy the nature. Nicely kept garden with lost of space. Ideal to take photos. Enjoyed the green houses with verity of cactus, orchids, roses, tropical flowers and ornamental plants. Could see some birds, butterflies and lots of big bats. The Mahavali River runs along side of it giving some vibrancy. Away from the busy town life and noise. Less crowded when I visited and couldn't see any foreign tourists. Could see many rear plants. We visited late in the day and foot sore from earlier excursions so took a buggy with a knowledgeable driver,which was not very expensive.  A vast range of plants and trees in well organised sections, well worth a visit to experience another side of the busy city. The garden is impressive due to its size and diversity of the plants and in particular the tree-vellum fold. Definitely a place to relax and to be amazed. There are so many varieties of beautiful plants, flowers and spices. Having the monkeys around makes the experience even better. Highly Recommended. These gardens are definitely worth a visit. We spent 6 hours there, and could have spent longer. Great value for money, but regardless of that, there was so much to see, in these immaculately well kept gardens, which were easy to wander around, and a total joy to absorb oneself in. There was a vast array of plants and trees, ferns and spices, and a suspension bridge well worth walking over!. The gardens are set alongside the river, which made for a stunning setting. We travelled by tuk tuk each way which made the entire experience superb and unforgettable. The gardens are very well looked after and are beautiful. The fruit bats in the trees were great to watch. the range of species was vast and the whole gardens very well planned. There is a super grass area which local school children were using. There is a good cafe/restaurant and plenty of clean toilets. A really good day out. Lots to explore and wander on your own paths. We went on a sunday so it was a little crowded but it's still possible to find space on your own amongst the beautiful trees. Its well signposted and you can pick where you want to roam. The only place that was disappointing was the conservatory - seemed neglected and plants were not at all exciting. We spend a couple of hours here at the end of our day that started in Dambulla and ended in Kandy, and they were a thoroughly enjoyable couple of hours. If we hadn't told our driver to come back in two hours we might have stayed a little longer, but I think we saw most of the highlights. The orchids are of course fabulous, but to me the most impressive were the tress with plaques showing who had planted them and one. I must say the future Czar Nicholas II did a great job, as did Edward VII while Prince of Wales. You wouldn't miss a great deal by skipping the suspension bridge My one regret was that we were too early to see the flying foxes, and I failed to find the trees they were roosting in. You wouldn't think 24,000 of them could hide so well Lots of rather sweet young local couple walking round holding hands recently visited the Royal Botanical Gardens in Kandy and it was a beautiful walk. The cost of entry is 3000 Sri Lankan rupees per adult, and children under 5 or 6 do not pay, which is very advantageous for families (price for foreigners). Despite a rainy day, I really enjoyed the visit. We took a Golf Cart for 7 people, which costs 2000 Sri Lankan rupees for an hour tour. This proved to be more than enough to enjoy the gardens without tiring These gardens were a highlight of our time in candy. The gardens where a peaceful haven from a bustling city centre. There were many distinct areas and a huge variety of different types of trees. We could’ve spent hours and hours there This is a beautiful garden and a welcome haven from the busy centre of Kandy. There are so many interesting and unusual plants and it is a real joy to wander around for a few hours - I definitely recommend visiting if you are in or near Kandy. The photos on here and elsewhere online didn’t really do it justice, it is more impressive in real life! One of the nicest green spaces i've ever experienced Just a quick glance at all the trip advisor reviews on here and its obvious the botanical gardens are popular and highly rated. I can only add weight to that and say that we thoroughly enjoyed spending an afternoon here, though you could spend a full day if you had the time. We were contemplating just having a rest day round the pool at the hotel but decided to make the journey here and we were SO glad we did. Other places should look to this place as an example of a well thought out, maintained and looked after urban green space. It contains a bewildering variety of plants and trees, giant fruit bats hanging from and flying between the trees, monkeys you can get right up close to, lakes, and an orchid house with some of the most amazing flowers. There is a cafe / buffet restaurant in the park, but this would make a lovely place to bring a picnic. If you appreciate and enjoy nature and green spaces then this is a must visit if staying in or near Kandy. It is approx. 15 mins from Kandy city to here by tuk tuk and the fare should cost about 5 GBP. If you have already been on a tuk tuk with a mad driver then you will understand what an 'experience' this is, and if you haven't then do try to experience this at least once in your travels ! Its is a huge botanical garden in the middle of Kandy city. Those with an inclination towards plant studies will have a great time exploring the garden as it has a lot of variety of plantation. We loved the greenery and beautiful flower garden. To my surprise we have seen a double coconut tree inside the garden and same dried one is for display in a museum inside premises. You can spend entire day if you wish to in a calm and beautiful garden. Please note it has an entry fee. I'll suggest to improve on the direction maps so people can explore their interest due to limited time being a tourist. 200 year old royal botanic garden with a huge variety of flora and fauna to see.  TIPS: thousands of bats live on the island, so if you are lucky (or loom long enough, you will definitely see and hear them. unique experience. I would suggest to plan 1.5 hrs. Garden tours on electric gold vehicles are also on offer for those who cant walk long Nice place for walking and for those who are addicted to the nature. We spend 3 hours there and the place was amazing I am not usually a botanical gardens fan, but our innkeeper and many guide books recommended this, so we decided to give it a try (especially since it was Monday and the Tea Museum was closed).  What a pleasant surprise!  The various avenues of palms are striking and you can enjoy many areas of shade as you explore the grounds.  The gift shop is excellent as well. You could easily spend hours here, but 90 minutes was enough for us. Enjoy! Extensive botanical gardens which seem well frequented by Sri Lankans. While covering a significant area, this is not as impressive as Botanical Gardens in other global locations (and probably influenced a lot by climate). We visited as part of a Sri Lanka Tour (and to pass time before something else). The botanical gardens are the largest in Sri Lanka, with huge areas of green well kept lawns. There are many different aspects to the gardens which contain specific sections such as orchids, rubber trees, the palm avenue to name a few.

Nice Experience, Length of visit is 10 to 20 minutes. as of now Admission fee. You should visit here and the lighthouse a little further along the coast road in Point Pedro. Both mark the closest point to India 32km away and the northernmost point of Sri Lanka. The guard at the navy base will usually let you go to see inside the lighthouse. You can't climb up but the tsunami reached is marked above the top of the entrance. Sankkotai, the northernmost point of Sri Lanka, is a place of great significance and beauty. Standing at this remote location, where the land meets the ocean, provides a unique sense of connection to the island's geography. However, visitors should be aware that there is no dedicated parking area at Sankkotai. You’ll need to park at a distance and walk to reach the point, which adds to the experience as you take in the natural surroundings. Travel Tip: The road conditions leading to Sankkotai are not ideal, so plan your visit in the morning or evening when the temperatures are cooler. Comfortable shoes are recommended for the walk. Despite the lack of facilities, the stunning views and the importance of the location make it a must-see for anyone traveling through northern Sri Lanka. This is the northern most point in Sri Lanka. There’s a special area built to represent the unity of Sri Lanka. The beach around here is full of coral rocks and beautiful. There’s no designated parking area and you have to park beside the road.

The permanent signpost erected here in concrete reads ""Unity in Diversity is the Strength of Sri Lanka"".  All along the shoreline are boats indicating that the livelihood of people around here revolve around fishing. Other than the erected concrete signpost, there does not appear to be any other activity.",4.1,8,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/32/25/f1/32/this-place-important.jpg?w=700&h=400&s=1,0.0,16.666666666666664,0.0,0.0,16.666666666666664,66.66666666666666
Samudra Parakrama,"Samudra Parakrama. This lake is actually a reservoir created under the reign of King Parakrambahu. His reign was the height of Polonnaruwa, a time of great construction. He is credited with a pathetic phrase: ""No rain drop can sail into the ocean without serving the people."" Logically, the reservoir was named after him - ""the Parakram Sea."" In the 12th century, the reservoir had a huge area of 2,500 hectares and was not quite in the same place as it is today. Beautiful and serene site. Kept very clean. Lovely breeze. Even more beautiful when one learns all about its history. Definitely worth a visit. As you drive around it, you realize how huge it is. Beautiful. Also, a good place for people watching. The reservoir was built by King Parakramabahu 1 in an attempt to alleviate water shortages during the dry seasons. There were 5 reservoirs to ease the pressure on the main dam. Thopa Vewa was constructed in 386AD and the King had the other  four reservoirs built and the system expanded with many smaller reservoirs to built to feed the five primary and take away any excess water. It was a complex ancient technology that worked until reconstructed in the 19th century when a structural design error altered the water flows. As a result there are now two lakes the largest consisting of Thopa Vewa, Eramudu Vewa and Dumbuthula Vewa and the smaller Kalahagala Vewa and Bhu Vewa. A very scenic area and we had the good fortune to see a small herd of seven elephants nearby. DescriptionParakrama Samudra is a shallow reservoir, consisting of five separate reservoirs connected by narrow channels in Polonnaruwa, Sri Lanka. The northernmost reservoir is the oldest and referred to as Topa wewa built around 386 AD For more info - www.facebook.com/reisesl giant water tank in polonnaruwa,fresh breeze,very interesting,high technological knowledge based irrigation system is there,evening boat fishermen are eye catching with sunset view,last week i visited the area,very interesting place at evening and early morning, me and my family visited the place,we had a driver,guide,and the place was so amazing,fresh breeze,blue water,very attractive,giant water tank like a sea guide explained us that there was a huge irrigation system,and nice history we spent nearly 2 hrs there,and we saw sun set view,great!! A very big lake, popularly known as 'samudra' meaning 'sea' is worth visiting. It is providing water for irrigation, power generation, navigation, fishing and lot more activities. The road leading to Polonnaruwa, while it approached the town, is lined by a large water body, which appears quiet soothing and beautiful. The lake is manmade, many centuries ago and the government has taken over its up keep in the recent years. The water body supports many species of birds and animals as well there is a lot of greenery on its banks. The nearest banks are walking distance from the Museum and from where bicycles can be hired for sightseeing. It forms the first spot of a guided tour. It's really huge river situated in polonnaruwa.very beautiful Sun rising and Sunset. I hired to bicycle to there.It's was perfect remembered to me This dammed lake borders the town and there a few places to see it from close to the ruins, in particular if you ride south from the museum towards the southern group of ruins.  Many hotels are alongside the lake and these can be very pleasant - quiet, lots of wildlife and good sunset views. Great place for a serene drive with friends. Great scenic beauty with lake on one side and tropical fields on others. Difficult to find a place to stop you car and enjoy, since its a single lane road. Yet a must visit This is a man made tank by the king to irrigate the agricultural lands.Later on renovated by the government.A good place to visit with a local . Parakrama Smudraya-Sea of Parakrama is one of the greatest milestone of Sri It is the Sri Lankan irrigation history. Parakramabahu Great ( 1164-1196 AD) built this reservoir by connecting five nearby lakes during Polonnaruwa era. Latest renovation happened at latter part of colonial era under the guidance of Sir D.S.Senanayaka. There are many things to visit around Parakrama Samudraya. We had an opportunity to have a boat ride at Parakrama Samudraya by fishing boats. It was a half a day journey without life jackets. Better visit this place having the background history knowledge. A very large man made water body to hold & retain water for agricultural purposes built by the ancient Kings. Parakrama Samudra (or King Parakrama's sea or the Sea of King Parakrama) is a shallow reservoir, consisting of three separate reservoirs connected by narrow channels in Polonnaruwa, Sri Lanka. There are plenty of wonderful sights in Sri Lanka relating to their heritage and the Buddhist faith. It is peaceful and very well preserved. You can drive all along the dam for so many miles up to the other end of the lake. Locals call it Parakrama Samudraya meaning ""Parakarama Sea"" indicating it is quite large compared to thousands other man-made Lakes (Locals call it Weva) in and around Agricultural areas in the country. The same King is famous for saying "" I will not allow any bit of Water fallen from the Sky (Rain) to be drained out to Sea without utilising for my public""  Irrigation system which is still used today, yes it is a tank, but you would not know it. It circles the city and was used as a defensive border against intruders many years ago. It was an amazing experience to cross different parts of the lake by fishery boats. There are some paid boat tours organized by surrounding hotels at Parakrama Samudraya. You will definitely feel a Sea like atmosphere when tank is fully filled and wonder how such large dams are built during those times (11th Century) without heavy Machinery or technology. Look other side and you will be more surprised to see astonishing Brick and Stone work in ancient Polonnaruwa City thought to be built around same time also using soil dredged to make the lake. It is a great experience in a morning. We drove towards the Angamadilla village and parked in many places to observe the scenic views of the lake. You may even ride in a bike. For a long ride, morning 6-7am is recommended. But for eve, you shall only ride along the main dam as elephants are coming to the rural end. Paddling a local’s made ORUWA in Parakrama Samudraya was a delightful experience we had. This is a rare chance we had.  Sitting and watching in-front of the lake at sunset is really wonderful. Do not use liquor since the police are always watch nearby.

There are plenty of wonderful sights in Sri Lanka relating to their heritage and the Buddhist faith. This whole area is worth a visit but do it gently and let your imagination run away with you. It is peaceful and very well preserved. Worthy of a few hours. Paddling a local’s made ORUWA in Parakrama Samudraya was a delightful experience we had. This is a rare chance we had. Thank’s to Sudu Aralia Hotel. The 'tank' at Polonnaruwa is huge and beautiful - it's hard to believe that it's a man-made lake. Our guidebook indicates that it goes under the name of 'Topa Wewa (Parakrama Samudra)'. We cycled past it late in the afternoon on our way from the main archeological sites in the north to Potgul Vihara in the south. Although we didn't come across any tourist facilities on the quiet Lake Road, in our opinion, it's still worth taking a few minutes to relax and admire the views. Irrigation system which is still used today, yes it is a tank, but you would not know it. It circles the city and was used as a defensive border against intruders many years ago. Sitting and watching infront of the lake at sunset is really wonderful.Do not use liquor since the police are always watching nearby. Dating 8-12th century AD this giant water tank consists of 3 tanks combined together to make it one giant tank, the bund around the tank spans 14kms, whilst feeding the irrigation system around Polonnaruwa and surrounding areas it feeds water in to smaller tanks around and helps the region to be amongst the top areas of paddy cultivation, don't miss out to see the Parakrama statue, Nissanka Lathaa Mandapaya which are related ancient ruins in the vicinity, No public WC close by, if you are visiting only this site you don't have to buy any entry tickets well for now! Enjoy Parākramabāhu I also known as 'Maha Parākramabāhu' was king of Sri Lanka from 1153 to 1186. Samudra Parakrama alos known as Parakrama Samudra is the largest irrigation tank of king Parakramabahu I. Its 5,600 acres of  water irrigated an estimated 18,200 acres of paddy land during that time. Samudra in sinhala means sea hence Parakrama Samudra means King Parakrama's sea. This has to qualify as one of the most far seeing constructions in Asia. The king (seen to be almost as a god by his people) built this lake/reservoir as part of a complex and sophisticated irrigation system which led to great prosperity for his country. Perhaps it has ultimately helped to make Sri Lanka so different to its much larger neighbour even today?",4.3,43,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/16/ff/c1/86/samudra-parakrama.jpg?w=700&h=400&s=1,0.0,14.285714285714285,7.142857142857142,7.142857142857142,25.0,46.42857142857143
Sella Kataragama Temple,"Sella Kataragama Temple. Quite some history at this temple especially with relation to Lord Murgan. It's on the banks of Manik river and at times it seems like it is in the middle of the river. Usually a first stop before visiting Kataragama This is holly place for god Walliamma’s people. That god is one of wife of god Katharagama. And that kovil is situated in beautiful place next to the river. And there is Buddhist temple next to that kovil. This temple is open after the morning puja for people to pray and the Iyar is there to carry out individual puja. Sellakatharagama is few Kilometers away from Kataragama main city. Recommended to visit there and to get a historical, spiritual and cultural experiences. Sell katharagama has developed well over the past years. this time i have visited about 05 years after and i pleased to find the area is well organized and kept clean. over the years back, the place was too untidy and wasn't pleasant enough. how ever, being a one of the leading religious place, and many travelers are pilgrimages, they used to buy basket of fruits to worships the god. Sella katharagama is cheapest compare to other places. How ever, price of fruit basket is 03 time or more if you are going to buy from katharagama and Kiri Wehera area. i strongly suggest, if you are traveling on your own vehicle, please have the fruits taken before hand and this will help for you to save lot unnecessary expenditure which is not worth enough. also most of the traders around the area are too rude. in case if you want to buy vegetable, you may find that it's much cheaper than the Colombo or sub-herbs. but the vegges are sold in bags full, and only you will have good stuff on the top. the bottom is full of rotten vegetables. be careful in case if you wants to buy vegetables. A temple very close to the main Kataragama temple dedicated to Lord Ganesh, the god of wisdom. Head coverings and footwear have to be removed. The Pooja we went was in the evening around 6 pm. A beautiful Buddhist temple also on the same premises allows people to worship the devale and the temple it is a kovil "" Ganapathi"". & also there is a temple newly build. many kovils & dewala situated here. can learn lot about hindu & local goddess. feeding fish was an amazing experience by the river bank. Very crowded in weekends can park the vehicle very near to the temple, try the road before the market can drive near the temple. Another  beautiful  sacred buddhist pilgrimage site in Kataragama. So many places to wotship within the site. Never miss to worship or visit this holy site whenever you visit Kataragama. This is a holy place situated next to Manik ganga. (river). There are lots of small shops and restaurants. But beware of touts and fake faith healers and what not. The temple above the kovila is a nice place to relax. Day time temperature is high during mid day in this area. After we parked the car, we walked ton a lane that has lots of shops on each side selling food, drinks, souvenirs etc and then we entered the temple complex. The main temple sits on the banks of a river. The temple is undergoing some maintenance just now and  the ""tower"" has been repainted gold and white.  As usual there are lots of statues of deities about, but  Ganesh is the most prevalent. We walked inside the ""main"" temple but could not get into the inner sanctum as it was closed off. It is a sacred place. You can observe much more activities if you can be there by morning 10. Highly crowded place in the weekend. This temple is close to Kathirkamam Murugan temple but not sure if you can walk it. It is situated next to a river same as Kathirkamam Murugan temple. It is a must go place for religious people. Sella kataragama, at a short distance from Kataragama is a beautiful plce. A village with all the basic ingredients of a village. A Ganapathi temple is at the centre , surrounded by the Shrines of Durga Devi, and Shiva on the sides . A small brook flows just behind the Ganapathy temple. Outside the Ganapathy temple on the eastern side we see a flight of stairs leading to a vast area, with many Buddha Vihars and Muruga Temples. As in Kataragama temple , here also there is a screen in front of the sanctum sanatorium, with beautiful figures of the lord. Ample parking place outside the temple. Many shops selling herbs greet the visitors. A visit to this temple must be included in the Srilanka tour. Another place of worship in the locality and all locals visiting the town makes it a point to visit and offer their worship to this place too. A historical place with lot of stories of how it came to be. Beleif is that Sella Kataragama has to be visited first before visiting Kataragama. Sella is about 10 minutes drive from Kataragama. The road to Sella from Kataragama is beautiful with trees lined on both sides of the road. If you are travelling by bus then take a bus that goes to Buttala. The Kovil is about 100 meters from the bus stop at Sella. There is small river flowing by the side. The Kovil is open right through the day till 7.30 p.m. If you are not oriented traditionally I suggest that you visit this temple after visiting Kataragama since there the temple closes in the afternoon from 1.30 to 6.15 p.m.Here in Sella the main deity is Lord Ganesha. I missed the Valli amma Kovil since i went there after 12 noon. The banks of the river are a bit unclean.which spoils the beauty of the place.. you can spend 30 minutes to a hour in Sella This temple is right in the river of manikai Ganga. The temple is small and it is recommended to go here before visiting the katharagama temple Unlike as in Kataragama, here people coming for their wishes, may be for a exam, for a sickness.. Usually very crowded. But, mind relaxing. Good place to visit in kataragama. It's very crowded. But still very popular with Hindu and Buddhist population in Sri Lanka. I was not taking pictures here, becase it was full of people ready for ceremony. It is better to cover your knees and shoulders. You can buy flowers and food at market in front of this temple. There are free walking cows eating trash (flowers and fruit). This place is near Kataragama. One Buddhist temple and A gana Devi Kovil is there. Manik river is close by When you visit to Kataragama Temple, you can visit this temple also. This temple got usual Hindu priests for religious activities. This temple is belongs to the wife of god katharagama as believe by sri lankans and lots of pilgrims visit during ti's season in August every year, they believe this place as on of them's spiritual god's wife's temple Cleanliness should improve. Too many shoppers and interrupting the religious atmosphere. The authorities should not allow shoppers inside the temple, like in Kataragama. This is the sister temple of the main Kataragama temple.You can combine both together. The Manik river goes along the temple. People call this place as ""Gage Dewale"" also. very beautiful kovil situted close to Manik Gaga. You can also feed fish in the river. This is lord Ganeshas kovil and you will find a temple when you climb up the stares. This is small temple next to a river. You have to walk 1/2 km to reach the temple, lots of bugs in the temple, if stand for five min you will be surrounded by thousands of bees. We did stay for more than 10 min with kids Lord Ganesha has settled down here and the prayer times are excellent. I go early to be there in the front to ring the temple bell during puja time Omm namo Ganesh! God of Ganesh! We are deffnetly visit there when we go kataragama.  Specially get help to the children's.  Who study! Nice locations.  Lot of monkey. Looking frowerd to visit there. Sella Kataragama is a very important place in Kataragama. About 4 mile from Sella to Kataragama. At the long distance fast a love seen was between Skanda Kumar and Valliamma at here. One mile short tunnel of Sella Kataragma is Valli’s cave. There is a small shrine to Ganesh, which s visited by the pilgrims. There is the place tradition says walliamma met the elephant when she was escorting Kataragma to the well. Sella Kataragma has many Kovils. Those are Ganapathi Kovil, Siva Kovil, Kataragama Kovil, Valliamma Kovil, Lakshmi Kovil and Saman Devalaya There were lot of devottes were there. I usually attend  10.15 am poojawa. It is too good to go there at that  time. It is in the middle of menik river. Sella Kataragama is the first place that Lord Kataragama/Muruga ever set foot in Sri Lanka. He came to Sella looking for Goddess ""Valli"" that became his wife soon after. Sella Kataragama is where they settled and continued their life. The cave is still much alive for the holy worshippers and the foot print of Goddess ""Valli"" is still to be seen, which is breath taking. Sella kataragama is a must visit to any holy hearted worshipper as it was the beginning of the whole Holiness of the entire area of Kataragama. A very nice temple which I have visited. Nearby River creates a nice atmosphere. This place is very calm. worth while going and see. Before we commence our Kathirkamam temple visit, we must get the blessings of Lord Ganesh, so we need to travel 5km northwards to worship a small temple in a village. Adjoining river give us a tantalizing effect and meditation mood automatically. we visit meny time to sellakataragama sellakataragama is indiya murugan kovi same place,india pepols visit the place, Is place of devine purity for people on the way to the spiritual growth. One of the most authentic places in Sri Lanka Very important  place for Hindu peoples.  There's a Hindu kovil.  The story of Rama - Sitha is created surrounded by the sella kataragama.

Now it has been established temples. Nice place. Near the Ruhunu kataragama Maha devalaya. it's 5km to there. it's also very popular place. I love that Sella Kataragama Temple #### A less traveled Kovil.  It was quiet with very few devotees during mid week.  There was shade, making it easier on your bare feet to tolerate the sand. This temple is worshipped by both Hindus & Biuddhists,also Indian nationals  too  visit this temple. The temple has so many legends, if you are interested in the history make sure to get a Guide or guidebook as language can be a problem. Also be appropriately dressed as a mark of respect to Hinduism. it's always a pleasure to visit this holy shrine where all religions can worship no matter what your religion , I can only explain it as a mystic place of worship .Sella Kataragama is a little away from the main Kataragama and one needs to travel out of the main temple area to reach this shrine, all the same it is a must visit for first timers. A must see after visiting the main temple in Kataragama. A more compact temple site compared to the open grounds of the main temple. Need to navigate yourself through the vendors who line the walkway down to the temple. If you visit kataragama, you have to visit this place. it is few kilometers from the town. The river is very dangeres as you get crocodiles in it. This is a religious place like Kataragama initialy there was a Ganapathy (vinayagar) temple was here now it had been developed and many shrines are there. It is believed that God Murugan met Valli with the help of his brother Ganesh. There is a river by the side of the temple its worth making a visit if you go to Kataragama A Wonderful Temple on the Banks of Manika ganga. The gurgling sound and sight of the RIVER flowing at the back drop of the temple is undescribable .It s about 8km from Kataragama and you can take tuktuk for 500 to 600 lkr up n down.A must see place for any temple tourist .You have the Lord Ganesh and Muruga together in a sannidhi and there are smaller sannidis for navagraha and anjaneya .There is also a new built temple above and a Buddhist temple too.",4.5,52,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0f/dc/53/d1/photo0jpg.jpg?w=700&h=400&s=1,0.0,8.333333333333332,12.5,0.0,12.5,66.66666666666666
Shrine of Our Lady of Madhu,"Shrine of Our Lady of Madhu. Very peaceful location, it is from 100 Km from Anuradhapura city. You have travel through A14 road and turn. When you enter the property, you have to enter your details on the security book. Remember to remove your shoes when entering to the main building. You can purchase candles from the shop next to the church. A very old catholic shrine in Sri Lanka. Someone bares similar resemblance to Lourdes. Lovely to see the different cultures in Sri Lanka This is one of the oldest shrines in Sri Lanka located close to Mannar . Very peaceful and a must visit when you visit this part of the country . This is a old popular Catholic Church in Srilanka. During the feast lots of pilgrims visit this Church from all over the world. The surrounding area of the church has become very much urbanised. I can still recall the woodland like surroundings and the forest beyond when I last visited the holy shrine in early seventies. On this occasion, the time we visited the shrine was almost midday and it had less pilgrims thus providing us with an easy access. No word to express how I feel about this location which is filled with all kind of blessings from our lady Madhu. We were lucky to visit and participate with feast held at Madhu shrine this time of the year and we are hoping to visit our lady Madhu on August. Thank you Amma. A visit to the Madhu shrine is the main attraction in the area and of great religious significance to Catholics. Turn off to the church from the Madawachchiya-Mannar road. 10 kim to the shrine from the turn off. Signs well posted, so you cannot miss it. Early morning masses daily. Sunday masses are held till 11.30 am. The major Catholic Church in Sri Lanka. People visit this place with so much faith and they believe that miraculous things happens after worshiping at this place. Non Catholics also can visit the place and experience the church and how the Catholics do their prayers. The church is located in dense jungle and survived the civil war which lasted for 3 decades. Now the access roads are very well built. Most Secret miraculous Holy place. You will receive what ever you ask for from Our lady of Madhu. Praise the lord!!! September is a great month to visit the Madhu Shrine. Lovely weather. Rainy in the evening and sunny in the morning. Large number of devotees present BUT not crowded. We were able to hear Bi-lingual Mass, pray at the shrines and chapel. Natural Bees Honey available right along the main road. However, prices must be researched prior to visit to ensure a good bargain. Our wish to spot a straying Sloth Bear along the main road did not materialize. Area residents say its a common happening. Very Good visit. Visited en-route to Sigiriya, This is place of significance for Catholics mainly. but people from other religious beliefs also visit. A place of pilgrimage where people go to pray for miracles / blessings. This church is dedicated to Mother Mary What do you want in your life go and ask the mother Mary with in 12 months your life will be in a beyond your expectations. Just try once to visit and ask from mother mary Cars are not allowed in, but for the disabled, a wheelchair was provided so that access to the church wasn't difficult. Masses are said frequently, and we were able to stay for a service. This is place of significance for Catholics mainly. Its well maintained and run by the Catholic Church. A place of pilgrimage where people go to pray for miracles / blessings. Good for those who believe. Can get very crowded. Specially during festivals and Sundays.

I first visited more than 50 years ago with my parents and siblings. In those days, the drive, in a car without air conditioning or power steering, on a rutted road, took more than two days. We made overnight stops at Kalaoya and A’pura. The trip was dangerous, because from Puttalam, we traveled through thick forest, inhabited by elephants, leopard, and bear. We recited the rosary and sang hymns. The forest is gone now, except for the reservation around the shrine. The shrine itself was damaged during the civil war, but has been lovingly restored by the army. It’s a beautiful structure. The area can be very crowded during the various feasts throughout the year, but on the weekday I visited, hardly 20 visitors were around. Accomodation consits of small houses built by families, which they occupy during visits, but are rented out by the shrine authoritiies to other visitors when they are vacant. I was disaapointed to see that these houses appared to be in a state of neglect. I certainly wouldn’t  think of staying overnight at one of these houses. Instead, at stayed at the Palmyrah Garden Hotel, which I have reviewed on Tripadvisor. The shrine is well worth a visit. The roads, all the way from Colombo, are excellent. This is a very popular church here in Srilanka. For the annual festival Catholics from all over Srilanka come here.A beautiful church. The toilet facilities were utterly horrible and soured my experience of the church, which I had wanted to visit for a very long time.  Such a busy church to provide facilities so bad is totally demeaning to the worshippers. Must visit place for all Religious people. Huge area where you can see the Shrine of our Lady.

It was very charming experience to be there, it was a church located in woods my suggestion is every catholic must visit the church for worship So much peace and calm can be obtained here.  Just sit in front of the shrine and meditate.  Very miraculous, you must promise to return again to give thanks. Sadly there is no mid day mass on week days, so if you deicide to visit on a weekday just for the day the mass is early morning only. The church is a very simple design.  It's beautiful to walk around. Our Lady of Madhu is a small but delicate statute at the head of the church. There is a cafe to eat at the church serving ok food (curry and rice) which is cheap ($6.80 for 4 people). The toilets are however the worst I have ever come across. I cannot imagine how much worse it would be during the August festival with throngs of people. in upcountry or in fortresses of southern province i found churches with amazing architectural designs but here it isn't the church which takes the eye. and there are locals who travelled many miles to reach it and now sleeping inside and outside and its very ugly. 😂 Though this shrine is venerated by the catholic community, its known to attract believers of other religious faiths too A must go place for all faithful, lots of Pilgrims visit this place annually and supposedly has many miracles. A venerated Catholic church to Our Lady. Feast celebrated in August which draws huge numbers of pilgrims. The jungle shrine has recently undergone indiscriminate garish treatment and it is now kitsch and commercialized. There is fare distance to walk from the car park road closure to the shrine. Sad to see it in this condition, stripped of its former charm and sanctity. During festivals, very busy & active but no proper/clean wash room facilities. We travelled further up towards north & stayed in a little guest hose in Manar we have been here to Madhu church several times. Very good place as facilities been arranged by the church. Very powerful miraculous place among Christians. The Shrine of Our Lady of Madhu or simply the Madhu Church as the locals used to call it, is the most popular catholic church in the island. A beautiful place. Its history spans more than 400 years and in August, when the annual feast of the church is on, the place is very much populated with local pilgrims. During the other times a nice and quiet place. This is quite a famous place for Catholics and large numbers visit specially during the feast. There are rows of houses to rent with many being just the building without beds and a number of them without toilets. One has to use common toilets and wash/bath areas. So renting these requires planning as one has to take everything. We booked one of the houses through a friend who knew a priest (as we are Buddhists, we didn't have any connections to the church nor knew much about the process). We were given a house number when we booked and asked to collect the keys from the office. When we went to the office we were given a key to a different house saying that was better! When asked for directions, all the information we got was that it's behind the church. The staff at the office were rude and did not show even an ounce of kindness. We were shocked at the treatment at this place of worship. After driving along a number of little lanes we found the house and when we opened it, it was damp and smelled of bats, and no toilet! As there were many empty houses around, we looked at some from outside and went back to the office to ask for one of the houses that had a toilet and shower facilities and said we are happy to pay more. But was refused point blank. We proceeded to Mannar where we were planning to go the next day. As a result we couldn't stay for the service 6.00pm service. Madu shrine...one of most famouse church amoung catholics in sri lanka....affected during the war and now almost anyone can reach without any issue...almost crowded during the period church feast...for site lovers please avoid the month of august.... This place is popular among Roman Catholics, this place have long history and one of the must see place in the are Situated in vanni. Now open for civiliance since 2004 after a 30yrs of War. Lacks are participating for the church events. Long drive from Colombo. Minimum facilities available. A very spiritual place of historical religious significance. Very accessible on good road. A much visited Catholic shrine by people of all religious denominations The Shrine of Our Lady of Madhu is a beautiful church close to Mannar. It's very populair, most of the Sri Lankan Christian people will visit it, especially during big events and holidays. We like this place. Madhu Shrine of Our Lady of Madhu is a #Catholic church with a #history of over 400 years in #Northern #SriLanka. It is accessible both by train and road. The place is of veneration particularly to Catholics, but any given day there are Christians, Buddhists, Muslims and Hindus who come here to prey and receive blessings. For the pilgrims who intend staying overnight, there are Rooms and cottages to be rented from the Office of the Church. For Catholics and non Catholics who believes  in Mother Mary a church to worship. If you really need to see miracles 'visit the church in real belief' Mother Mary will instantly show a miracle. A must see place around Mannar. Good access road. Only 45 minutes from the turning point of the main road to return. A most reverent place in Mannar, Sri Lanka. All your prayers would be heard and would be fulfilled. You can stay at Mannar which is quite closeby. In off-season, there are nobody in the church except few believers. But when the main ceremony ongoing, LOTS of people come here to pray. At that time, this is well crowded. Big parking space, camping areas, ATM, water and toilets available. Shrine of Our Lady of Madhu is one of the en-route destinations in the north of Sri Lanka, between Mannar and Jaffna. The history of this catholic church goes back for over 4 centuries. To safeguard the catholic mission this shring was kept in the jungle of Madhu. Now, it’s being a very popular church and a most visited pilgrim among the catholic population around Sri Lanka. Also, visited by tourist regardless the religions, ethnics, nationalities  and so on… The services/mass are conducted in both the native languages (Tamil & Sinhalese) in the mornings and the evenings. The special festival season is in August and the final festival is on the 15th of August. During this period the area is crowed and the church is filled with pilgrims, which makes the visit of the church a highly busy. So, better avoid this period to visit here. Pilgrims can rent accommodation around the church for a very reasonable price. Eating around is a challenge. (The food available in the canteen adjoining the church is not up to the mark and a bit over priced for what you get. But, it’s a clean and comfortable place to sit and have something to eat.) Having a dip in to the fresh water pond closer to the church is possible and something interesting to do. NB: Im rating this land mark as excellent as Im a catholic and still believe and following the same. En route to Mannar we decided to take a fairly long detour to visit this place and discovered a small settlement of accommodation for visitors, market, hospital etc. In fact everything that might be found in a small town Compared to other cathedrals and churches elsewhere in Sri Lanka we found the religious buildings here quite underwhelming in terms of scale and architectural detail - and as we were not on a pilgrimage our visit did not last long Roman Catholics from all over Sri Lanka make the pilgrimage to the Shrine. When we visited there was a large contingent from the Negombo area which has a large RC population By a good road you arrive easily at a large parking space to visit this beautiful church. When we came there the Sunday mass just started so we could not make any pictures from the inside. We did so from the nearby chapel. Everything is to visit for free and the outside placed statues/paintings from the death and resurrection of Jesus are very realistic en well placed to tell their story. Washrooms are not available: only the public ones, who are numerous but I do not recommend them at all. It is 10 Km off the main Medawachchiya-Mannar road. Not sure if public transport is available in the off-season. Can get very crowded during the festival times. Peaceful surroundings of the Madhu wildlife sanctuary provide meditative atmosphere. Recommend a visit to the nearby (on the other side of the main road) 'hanging bridge'. Although I am a Buddhist, my mother is a Christian and hence took her to visit this sacred site. I understand that this is a much revered site which has withstood the civil war and the heavy fighting which had engulfed the area previously. The area is now safe and fully accessible by road. Since this road winds through a forest area, it is advisable that it not be used during the night due to the wild life in the area. I also saw a railway station nearby (about 10 Kms away). The Pope also visited this church during his recent visit to Sri Lanka. sri Lanka is one of the best travel locations to visit. This place has a wide range of scenic beauties to offer. This article will discuss about all these locations that it offers. This article will help you explain what to expect in God’s Own Country, Sri Lanka Nothing like I expected from stories iv heard from my mother!! Its quite commercialised and built up.  An easy walk from the car park to the church. Do not use the toilets they are awful. Though there is not clear evidence as of when the church was built but for sure  there is a rich history underneath the magnificent church. It is know to host unbelievable number of people during the Its famous feast. Must visit place Shrine of our Lady of Madhu has a very ancient history ,and is visited by people of all faiths,it is surounded by the Madhu wild life sanctuary and a very calm and quite location you will always find some people here ,during the Madhu church feast it is fully crowded with people have been here many times hope the Madhu natural forest is not destroyed I really enjoyed the drive through the forest reserve although the road was very bad. This is mainly good for people who wants to pray than sightseeing. (since I do not believe in anybody else other than myself, may be I am little bias) You do not find good toilets even at a fee. Parking is not an issue and a beautifully designed restaurant is available. However, we lost our appetite when we went in but it is moderately good. This is a must see site regardless of your religious beliefs. It is a large compound with holy ancient statues. About 45 minutes drive worth of visiting Visited with my family and though we are Buddhists ,we felt the  blessings of the shrine very much. Very calm, Quite and peaceful place and we lit candle for each member , wishing to enlighten our lives. About 08 kilometer we drive off Talaimannar - vavniya main road and reached there. advice to visit the place in a morning or evening. Area is generally dry and hot. Roads are all right. Shrine is very beautifully constructed and renovated. Avoid devotional season ( Heavily crowded ) to enjoy a peaceful visit. This is religious area has recently been refurbished for the visit of His Holiness the Pope. The main approach road from the Mannar Road is quite well done and is macadamised. However, the road from the west coast Mannar-Pooneryn Road is a dirt track road which is barely navigable. suggest that one avoids this route. The shrine itself is serene and worthy of respect. This was my second visit to madu shrine for Catholics in sri lanka and for others religious devotes this is place of great faith and peace . for many years the shrine of madu was unreachable but now people from all over sri Lankan come to this place for blessings Very popular hly place in Mannar. People from around the Sri Lanka visits here and celebrate annual function, often in September I was able to pay a long standing vow to Our Blessed Mother and although the Mass was in Tamil/ Sinhala I was happy to participate , the Church was crowded , to see how so many people flock to this shrine from all corners of the Island says it all. Madhu church is well developed now with all facilities. But the calm and holy surrounding which was there 30 to 40 yrs before , when we visited at our childhood is no more. Jungle is cleared. Vehicle access restricted and cement constructions are in plenty. Visited after many years! Lovely surprise! Roads are done up well and the facilities are great! Arrival of Pope seem to be speeding things up! super reach through madavachiya - if you want adventure go thru wilpathuwa national reserve. the roads are super for a adventure if you got a SUV There are many stories surrounding Madhu church, but its generally easy to find and a nice place to visit. There's a cafeteria as well with some good food. A lot of people camp around the church, so we decided not to explore the rest rooms. BUt a definite must see if you're in the area. It is the same inner peace you receive when you go to The Shrine of Our Lady of Lourdes. People from all walks of life, religions come to pay homage to Our Lady of Madhu. Our family members and all who were at the Shrine were engaged in prayer. It's a very peaceful place and visited by many Christians and others as well. Lot of history and place to worship our Lady of Madu. You need to visit this church at least once Lot of Catholics come here to visit and is a pilgrimage to them and three persons who accompanies me had very special reason to visit Madhu and certain reasons to Pray for. It holds the Statue of Our Lady of Madhu and considered very powerful by Catholics.  We brought holy water and rosaries etc from there. You observe a lot of devotees visiting the place to make offerings for vows made or for special prayers. If you are Roman Catholic, this is the center of it all in Sri Lanka. If you're not particularly interested in religion, then it's a nice place to visit, but. The shrine itself is pretty enough, very well maintained (the Church is the largest landowner in the District, and one of the richest organizations on the island) and important as a critical battlefield site during the civil war. The raison d'etre is a small statue of the Virgin Mary, high atop the altar. The statue itself has a long and storied history in Sri Lanka, and so is famous. In-and-of-itself, it isn't much to look at, but then appearance is not what makes it importance. If you are Roman Catholic, or have a particular interest in Sri Lankan history and culture, you must visit the site. The casual tourist might be interested in stopping at Madhu for a half hour or so if passing through, but I wouldn't make it a goal. It all depends on your motivation for going. Madhu Church is about 230km away from Colombo on Mannar - Vavuniya highway. The road is good after recent development work carried out by the  RDA. Shrine of Our Lady of Madhu is a Roman Catholic Marian shrine commonly called as Madhu church. This is a prominent worship place of Sri Lankan Catholics . There is a canteen in the madhu church premises food is tasty and spicy. There are lots of flies in the canteen. We had a big ""?"" mark regarding the hygiene factor of the food because of this enormous amount of flies. This is an very old church and believed to be a powerful worship place for both Sinhala and Tamil catholics for so many decades. We saw many devotees praying to mother when we were there. Annual festival is taking place in August and we were told the whole premises get crowded with many thousands of devotees at the annual festival. The devotees come for the festival used to stay for number of days and it could be the reason why there are so many flies. Last week we went to this church, it is in 10 KM from Mannar - Vavunia highway the road is good and very well done. It is a Catholic St. Mary Church. as usual it has all the appearance of a worship place. There is a canteen the food is very spicy but tastier, only issue is LOTS of flies (repeat LOTS of) may be we were after the festival. I am told there are places to stay and inexpensive but very very basic. There is enough public transport from Colombo and other main cities. This is an old and believed to be a powerful worship place, you could see many devotees praying to mother.

Sorabora Lake,"Sorabora Lake. What I love about Sorabora Lake is that it blends ancient history with living nature. There is a legend tied to its creation, and it gives the place a special character. The story says that during the time of King Dutugemunu, a local giant named Bulatha took on the huge task of building a dam. He was not described as an engineer in the tale. He was known as an elephant keeper. Yet the legend says he used strength, patience, and massive stones to shape the water into this lake. Whether you take it as history or folklore, the spirit of the story matches what you feel when you stand there. This is a land with deep roots and remarkable old-world skill. Beyond the story, Sorabora Wewa is simply a lovely place to slow down. The lake is surrounded by forest and open sky, and the air often feels cooler and cleaner than you expect. If you enjoy birdwatching in Sri Lanka, this is a rewarding spot. You may see water birds gliding low over the surface, and you will often hear birdsong all around the shore. The waters and nearby trees support many small creatures, reptiles, and fish. Every visit feels slightly different. Some mornings are bright and still. Some evenings bring misty light and soft wind across the lake. If you are lucky, you might even notice signs of elephants in the wider area. These moments are never guaranteed, and that is part of what makes the place feel real. For experiences, Sorabora Lake is easy to enjoy without rushing. A boat ride on Sorabora Lake is one of the nicest ways to take in the scenery. The views open out gently, and you can see the lake edge, the hills, and the forest line from a peaceful distance. It is quiet, simple, and memorable in the best way. If you prefer land-based time, the shoreline is ideal for slow photographs, relaxed chats, and calm reflection. For travellers who love the outdoors, camping at Sorabora Lake can be a beautiful option. Imagine a night under the stars with the sounds of nature close by. It works well for couples, friends, and families who want a peaceful break away from busy roads and crowded attractions. The key is to plan it properly, with the right spot, the right timing, and the right comfort level. Sorabora Lake is not loud. That is why I often describe it as one of Sri Lanka’s true hidden gems. It is a place for travellers who want to feel the country, not just tick off landmarks. Sorabora Lake is a large man-made tank. There is a car park but it is a few hundred meters away from the tank, so you will have to walk a bit to get to the viewing area. It is wheelchair accessible if you don't mind getting a bit uncomfortable with the uneven surfaces leading up to the viewing platform. The ambiance is rather calming no matter the crowd. However, it will get quite busy during the hours when the sun is at its weakest. The viewing area is rather clean however the walk from the car park isn't, with quite a few health hazards going unnoticed. There isn't any staff present at the viewing area if that was something you needed to know. Also, there isn't anything to eat at the viewing area, though there may be non-permanent vendors around selling food and drinks. This was another fantastic experience for anyone passing through the area. The early morning sunrise cruise was truly mesmerising. Watching the sun rise over the lake, with no one else around, was one of the best attractions in the region. The tranquillity and beauty of the lake made it feel as though we were completely alone in the world. A slow paddle around the lake’s edge gave us the chance to admire the local wildlife, including water monitor lizards, kingfishers, herons, hawks, and many bird species. On some days, you may even spot wild elephants coming to the lakeside for food and water. The cruise ended at a local fish market, which few tourists visit, and was followed by a delicious breakfast on a rocky outcrop by the lake, offering breathtaking views of the fishermen starting their day. This experience was organised by the team at Kevan’s Casa, and their attention to detail made it unforgettable. A must-do experience to add to your bucket list. Despite the fact that watching the sun rise across the lake is an apparently popular tourist attraction, there wasn’t anyone else around, and we were able to watch a spectacular one feeling as though we were all alone in the world. A slow paddle around the edge of the lake preceded the show, and gave us the chance to admire a nice array of wildlife, including water monitor lizards, kingfishers, herons, and hawks. Then, after sun up, we had a delicious breakfast on a rocky outcrop that touches onto the lake, to take in the start of the day’s life for fishermen, school children, and others. A breathtaking way to start any day. I had a Wonderful experience, its so free and peaceful. The only thing is that people litter around their and that is  not very appealing. Please don't litter. What a fantastic experience it was to be there on the lake before dawn in a small boat. Once again it was Dilan Navarathne who was our guide and protector. Sorobora was a serene environment and picturesque place. The surprise breakfast on the rock was yet another gem of a surprise. You should try a boat ride after 4 pm and you will be amazed by the rich nature surrounding in Mahiyanganaya or else you can stay on the lake bund after 4 and  it will be a lifetime unforgettable experience to you. Please be vigilant , sometimes  Elephants are crossing the lake bund. A massive reservoir built by a giant in king dutugamanu era. It’s a very beautiful place and this has become a major tourist attraction in Mahiyanganaya. There are many shops on the way and you can have a boat ride also if interested. Boat ride cost us 1500 rupees. There are enough parking spaces. You have to walk a small distance from the parking to the reservoir. This is the only reservoir on Sri Lanka with a stone sluice gate. On to a side there’s a nice hanging bridge nd don’t forget to visit there as well. Go there early morning or evening. Around the lake calm and  windy... One of the ancient reservoir in mahiyanganaya  , This lake name as ""sea of bimtanna"" boat safari also best experience for us. Sorabora Wewa (Sinhalese: සොරබොර වැව) is an ancient reservoir in Mahiyangana, Badulla District in Uva Province, Sri Lanka. It is thought to have been constructed during the reign of King Dutugemunu (161 BC – 137 BC) by a giant named Bulatha. In the ancient past, this tank was known as the 'Sea of Bintenna'. This rock cut deep canal acts as the sluice for the tank. Currently the tank and this ancient structure have been declared as archaeological protected monuments. The tank was built by damming the Diyawanna Oya with a 485-meter embankment. It does not make use of the structure called Bisokotuwa, which helps to regulate water pressure at the sluice gates from inside the tank and protect the embankment from erosion. Instead that the sluice gate (Sorowwa) of the tank has been placed strategically away from the embankment and made up utilizing the massive natural rock around the tank. It is said that this is the only such type sluice gate found in Sri Lanka. Boat riding, camping site, places to have a bath are main features in Sorabora tank for enjoying travelers.  Surrounding environment is very beautiful and more attractive. #sorabora_wewa Sorabora tank is amazing masterpiece of Sri Lankan ancient irrigation technology. The most remarkable thing to see in this tank is, the Sorowwa (sluice gate), which was made out of natural rock. This is the only such sluice gate found in Sri Lanka.  Sorabora It is thought to have been constructed during the reign of King Dutugemunu (161 BC – 137 BC) by a giant named Bulatha. He used provide beetles to the castle. In the ancient past, this tank was known as the 'Sea of Bintenna'. #manmade #ancientreservoir #old #heritage #travelsrilanka🇱🇰 #travellerphotography #travelgram #tourism #tourUVA 🚕🚕🚕🚕😍😍😘😘✌️✌️👌👌📷📷📷📷📷 Ab 5-10 minutes away from town by car. Beautiful lake. Need to walk on a wel paved road for ab 10 minutes to get to the LKR. It’s beautiful. Great photo spots and viewing points. Have to get to the end of the lake if you wanna try the Shaking bridge. Take a walk. Also we got a shows by a snake, python and a monkey by a man on the side. Worth the show. We paid only few hundreds for the entire 15 minute show. Excellent place to visit and not to miss out. Will visit again since this place have something unique.... Beautiful Sorabora Wewa  called the Sea of Binthanne in the ancient past,  is a massive reservoir in Mahiyangana constructed in 102 BC, a must see destination for visitors. Historical legend is, of the herculean task of a villager named Bulatha. He noticed a stream of water passing between two hill, realized that if could be dammed is an ideal location for a water reservoir. He started building the embankment across two hills by himself. Bulatha completed the reservoir with a 40 feet tall and 11 feet wide embankment which stretched to about 500 meters  with a unique sluice gate, through a solid natural rock. Since the rock was not subject to erosion by the pressure of water, it’s considered to be a unique innovation. The village donated to Bulatha by King Dutugemunu called Udathwewa is today known as Udaththawa and lies about 8 km north of Hasalaka town. There are ruins of a large reservoir at Udaththawa with a sluice gate built similar to Sorabora Wewa. Using the natural rock to build the sluice gate seems be unique to Bulatha and these two tanks are the only 2 known reservoirs in the ancient irrigation history of Sri Lanka to use this technology. Sorabora Wewa is a popular place among holiday makers. There are stalls selling sweets and freshly brewed steaming cups of local herb tea with plenty of other stalls which sell almost everything from toys to sun hats. Beautiful , tranquilizing place to spend an evening among birds and nature and enjoy a boat ride available. My wife, grandson and I visited Sorabora Lake in the evening on 21st July 2019.  After driving about two kilometres along the Lake Road, we parked the car at the designated parking lot.  Parking fees Rs 80.00.  The path to the Sorabora Lake was clearly name posted.  All along the path were little shops selling trinkets, toys, foodstuffs and the like.  There were few kiosks too.  We reached the irrigation canal after a short walk of about 150 metres and walked up the steps towards the top of the embankment following the canal cut in solid rock.  On the lower stretches youngsters were frolicking in the water while the ladies and adults were enjoying a bath further downstream. A billboard on the way up provided information about the dam.  It had been constructed in the second century before Christ (bc).  The length of the dam is 1590 feet and supplies irrigation water to 2000 acres (800 ha).  It had been renovated in recent times by Irrigation Department. At the top of the steps was the unique sluice gate that I came here to see.  In most ancient and modern dams, the sluice/s to carry water downstream is/are located along the embankment of the dam.  Not so here at Sorabora Lake!  The sluice the left end of the embankment had been cut into solid granite rock.  The first 30 metres or so of the canal after the sluice runs in solid rock cut to shape in ancient times.  Thus water released through this sluice flowing under pressure along the canal does not erode its rocky banks.  Conversely, the downstream of a sluice through an embankment, may it be ancient or modern, needs to be protected against extreme soil erosion using pressure balancing chambers or concrete lining to counter the effects of erosion from fast flowing waters. I walked along the 1590 metre long bund to the right end of the dam where I observed the spillway and another irrigation canal.  There is a cute swing bridge too. The spillway, that operates when the dam is at full capacity, is cut into rock preventing erosion of its banks.  There is an irrigation canal at the right end of the dam too.  This had been constructed recently.  Visitors can enjoy a ride in the reservoir in one of the boats. There are fishing boats as well as individual fishermen fishing at the bottom of the embankment. It took me about two hours to explore the beauty and effectiveness of this ancient engineering meeting marvel. A bit difficult to reach but once there,a nice big lake. We were adviced to visit this when it was getting a little dark , to see all the big dog bats fly out .... helas we saw none! Great Boat ride service is Available . Has a lot of History to the Lake and amazing to see it still survives . A must visit place if you travel Mahiyanganaya. Located about 5mins away from the town of Mahiyanganaya. This huge tank was made by an ancient giant named Bulatha. You can spot beautiful birds and Crocodiles if you are a nature lover. Also the beautiful Knuckles mountain range. Please leave only your foot prints when you return. Nice Beautiful place...Nice view..Big trees in the dam. There is a hanging bride also...We can bath drain water. It'a very interesting beautiful , tranquilizing place to spend an evening among birds and nature . Many good hotels and restaurants near by. Beautiful place to visit so many street dogs but they are very nice dont bother you so if you go there please bring some food for them as well Water gushing out between two huge rocks and then flowing among rocks to the canals was amazing. The little boutiques near by sell various stuff & mee oil (medicinal oil for aches and panes) What a tank it is. It’s a must see by learning kids. The ancient work of ‘Bulatha Yodaya’ is amazing. All done with rock and stones. Feel proud of our ancestors. We took a paddle platform boat ride with our local village guide here at around 9 am. Beautiful Birds around. Saw a Water Monitor Lizard swimming really close to us.Serene lake - really worth chilling on a boat for an hour or so.We stayed one night in elevated tents and had some nice Barbequed fish for dinner. Only about a half hour to 45 min drive from the main road and Mahiyangana Town. We went there on April.corner of the lake there is a place to shower .thats  superb .nothing to say.we enjoyed very much.....we loved it.... Please protect the beautiful environment for  future This lake (actually a tank) is a 'must see' for anyone interested in the natural environment of Sri Lanka. It is a beautiful expanse of water, good to enjoy at all times of the day, but especially so at dusk when one can enjoy the birds and bats coming home to next in the trees. It exudes a serene and peaceful atmosphere. There are tuk tuk drivers always happy to drive one around the area - and show you elephants if at all possible - and local trading stalls selling foods and souvenirs - they do not bother you if you are not interested in purchasing anything but are more than happy to chat and tell you about the place. This is a cool place to visit in the evening. you can even see elephants crossing the river. they swim across the river   & we had pleasure to seen this. Very big tank & lovely place. must not   miss to visit if you traveling to Mahiyanganaya. It is an ancient lake.beautiful place.very peaceful atmosphere. There are few stalls selling food items and souvenirs at reasonable prices. No entry fee. This lake is very durty and we can do nothing around, to much people local in the weekend and very many small job shops who push you to paid some tings Must visit place by every sri lankan. This lake belongs to ancient history in Sri Lanka. Still it's live. Awesome man made lake. Nice technology and history around the Sora bora lake. It is a nice walk in the evening with amazing surrounding views. It takes a few minutes by foot to reach the lake. You pass along many small stall offering ""souvernirs"" and other kitsch. At the lake you have a nice view and there is a number of boats offering tours on the lake. Nice view . There is a Good historical value. Amazing. Should definitely come you visit Mahiyangana. Unless you are heading there for the sunrise i dont think it is a very attractive place. But you can have a small boat ride operated by a hand paddled person. As I heard it is not allowed to bathe here. But it is a huge tank. Stroll on the tank bund it is serene.Tank is huge & the stone cut Sluice is impressive having built over millania. Often times elephants can be seen across the other side of the tank.Take a Bino for a better look. Visited the lake and its huge , don't forget to climb to the top of the hill their it was a awesome view from their . If you are afraid of heights please don't climb it . Don't forget to try the boat ride the old fashion way ;) This is situated Mahiyangana, Badulla District. It is thought to have been constructed during the reign of King Dutugemunu by a giant named Bulatha. I was seriously surprised about the water level in the wewa when almost whole Sri Lanka was experiencing dry climate during those days.... I remember this location even through my childhood and it was a work of marvel by a Warlord of that era. They believe that he had made this structure so as to block the water by getting a large stone cramped onto another to make a stream to regulate the water supply to the then farmers for their cultivation of the land. Though the remnants of it still exists it has been renovated by the irrigation department. a must see attraction in Mahiyanganaya. It situated few km away from the Mahiyanganaya town.. if you are coming from the kandy road you have to take the Mahiyanganaya Polonnaruwa road.. It was a calm and nice place.. aroud the area there are lots of restaurant and hotels.. ideal place to have a bath.. but when we visited their surrounding got heavy crowd due to a public holiday.. One of must visit place in Mahiyanganaya.. The start of the walk is though some small shops kept by the villagers and not kept properly  but when u reach the destination it is a truly beautiful experience ...very calm and quite and relaxing among the beautiful trees...and fresh air to breathe... -Need to clean up the surroundings and the walk way to the lake A must visit place when you visit mahiyanagana. The Sorabora tank was built by King Dutugemunu in 102 B.C. in the Mahiyangana region. The water released from the tank for irrigation purposes flows along a  twenty meter sluice cut into solid rock by a Human Giant named ""Bulatha""",4.4,43,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/31/eb/d1/photo7jpg.jpg?w=700&h=400&s=1,0.0,14.634146341463412,2.4390243902439024,9.75609756097561,21.951219512195124,51.21951219512195
Surathali Ella,"Surathali Ella. 5 mins from main road to the base of the water fall. Good place to have a dip. Can visit with young children 6+. Had a great time with family and friends. This waterfall is at a reasily reachable place Even it can be seen from the main road. This is on the Colombo Badulla main road arround 10km after Belihuloya, as we were going from Balangoda. It is verymuch closer to the main road but to reach to the bottom of the fall need to walk a bit. But not a hard. It is near ""Pambahinna"" where the Sabaragamuwa University is situated. In Colombo - Badulla main road, pass Belihul Oya, then Pambahinna and drive another 7-8 km. Since there's no sign board available, check for the Bridge with a bend. The footpath is on the left hand side just before the bridge. There's plenty of space nearby the road for parking. The waterfall is only visible if you are traveling toward Colombo. Ask for directions from the the small shops. If you are using public transport, let the bus conductor know that you want to get down at Surathali Ella. They will help. This is a very safe place. No steep climbing. Even safe for bathing in shallow natural pools down stream. Kids can enjoy. Since no monitoring from an authority, there's no fee for entering the place. Keep the place clean please. This is quite easy to tick off your visit list - being just 10 minutes from the main road. Mostly an easy walk, with a couple of points you'd have to clamber a bit (though this was easily negotiated with even a 4 year old and a 60+ year old being part of our group). Fairly nice photo-friendly waterfall, not the highest but with a nice cascade. There are a couple of bathing spots (one easily accessible, one a slightly higher up steeper climb) that also seemed nice. A beautiful small waterfall which can be seen from the Colombo Badulla main road (A4). Just 50 meter walk on a foot path. Looks beautiful particularly during rainy season. Can have a safe bath.",4.5,6,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/4e/4b/81/view-from-down-stream.jpg?w=700&h=400&s=1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,20.0,80.0
Thirukoneswaram Kovil,"Thirukoneswaram Kovil. this Hindu temple belongs to lord Shiva,this temple in the middle of the ocean  There are small shops on the road Unfortunately, due to COVID, the Fort overall was very empty and most of the temple was closed to us. Otherwise, this was a very lovely temple to visit. The statues were amazing to look at as well as the architecture of the temple itself. The temple is quite a sacred one that is worshiped by locals belonging to different religions. It is quite colorful and well-kept. The ‘lovers leap’ is a steep rock that looks over the deep ocean. Do not forget to recite your wishes into the ear of “Nandi” statue and watch the serene beauty of the Trinco bay over a drink of an iced Lemon juice on the way to the temple. it was nice to visit a hindu temple, yet if there has some English descriptions, it should be nicer! got a bonus checkpoint before leaving which was a budda parade. p.s. shoes off and about 100m walk, beware of the wet ground Right on the Indian Ocean, this temple is a relatively new version of an ancient temple that Portuguese invaders destroyed several centuries ago. But Hindu Tamil priests keep the services going, several times a day. This temple was out of bounds for several years during the civil war and is now opening up again as peace returns to Sri Lanka If in the area, you must come and see this holy temple. it is ornate and pretty. It does get hot, and although there is some carpeting your feet will still get hot. There are plenty of stalls on the walk up, and you are also passing through the old portuguese fort, now home to the SL army. Odd to think that only 9 years ago this area was part of the civil war, but now so peaceful. The view is breath taking from the top of the cliff. If you go in the early morning you can enjoy the sun rise from here. As well participate for a traditional Hindu prayer and learn a little bit of the Hindu culture and history. This ancient Hindu Temple dedicated to Shiva has indie interesting murals of Ravana, the Shiva devotee. We were present for the evening Aarti and it was very nice to see the devotion and faith of the people. Ravana's cut - in the rocks outside the temple has an interesting story Hindu temple inside old fortress. Interesting to walk around but an uphill climb from the Fish Market area so maybe best to take a tuc tuc there and back. i love every inch of this place... the view was just breath taking, and the temple architecture was absolutely gorgeous In this temple u can feel a holy energy and full respect for Hindu religion. Please cover your shoulders and take off your shoes The location of this temple complex is amazing. Right next to the ocean, Since it is on top of an hill, the views from the complex are breath taking. The temple is very religious and is in indian style. After seeing a few Buddhist temples this was our first Hindu temple. The drawings and statues inside the temple are beautiful and impressive. Unfortunately you’re not allowed to take any pictures inside the temple. One of the most ancient temples of South Asia ,dedicated to Lord Shiva, dates back to the period of Rama mythologically,  and to the 6th Century B by historians. Said to have been worshiped by Ravana , ithe temple had one of the Suyambu Lingams as the main deity. During the 17th Century AD ( around 1630 s) the temple was supposed to have been razed to the ground by foreign invaders to build a harbour. The local priests hurriedly burred the important idols of the Gods before leaving the temple , fearing vandalism. And in 1956, in an underwater exploration , the old temple ruins were found, Besides a lot of inscriptions about the temple etc were also discovered . All the bits and pieces dicovered were put together and now a grand temple is there once again for us to worship. A great work of reconstruction of the temple as well as the history. The temple is sung about gloriously by the great poet saints. Sambandhar and Arunagirinathar. the Pandya Chola and Chera kings of south India  were said to have patronized and visited the temple.The Vilva tree is the Sacred tree of this temple. In 2013, when the civil works were undertaken for the temple, a beautiful Nandhi idol was discovered and it was found to belong to 11th Centurt AD. People believe that there many be many more to be excavated. The temple is also a seat of Sakthi Peetam, where the feet of the Amman were supposed to have been assocoated. Had no idea what to expect but was surprised ,very interesting Hindu temple. Leave your shoes with the shoe man for 20rp wash your feet with the plastic cup and walk up the hot stairs to the entrance. Perched on a clifftop with great views out over the ocean. Apparently it's a green zone no plastic or rubbish allowed in but look over the fence and there it all is !! Why throw it over the fence at a sacred places I don't understand It's a beautiful place and it's treated like a tip. The temple itself is outstanding ,the artwork over the top and incredibly colorful. Definitely worth a visit We really enjoyed walk around this site. Well worth a visit. Vendors selling drinks and snacks close by. Great views of the bay It's the most popular temple in Sri Lanka is Temple very beautiful in Sri Lanka you can find only two temples like this this Temple as a big history Go for the views and look at the colonial buildings and grounds of the fort. Don't forget to have shoulders and knees covered. The ground from where you leave your shoes to the temple was scalding. The temple of lord Shiva & has proven to be a temple that gent wishes and miracles. Please see image for the prayer time tables. Thanks Beautiful colourful temple situated on a cliff inside Fort Frederick. Unfortunately we couldn’t get inside because we arrived at sunset and there was a ceremony going on. Nevertheless we treated ourself with some drinks and some spectacular views. Located on a perfect sight with breathtaking scenic sea view, ideal time to visit early morning or evening! Visiting this beautiful temple late in the afternoon, we found ourselves almost intruding on everyday Hindu live. But we met only smiles from the people :) Impressive and worth a visite! We visited on weekend with family friends. A great experience to recommend others. Nice view over Trincomalee city. King Ravana and his mother had worshipped God Shiva this place. Today a major place for Hindu pilgrimage located @ eastern coast. Full view of Indian oean As you enter this place you can see loud music which can be for some people disturbing, but for me it was quite a fun. The place is very nice and offers a stunning ocean view. We had a brief visit here, the temple is simple, has a very nice location and an interesting history, both in terms of recorded colonial history as well as legends Beautiful place to visit and look at the grand colours used and kept so beautifully These are stunning places of worship The temple excursion itself was an average experience. The surrounding views though offered some lovely photo opportunities. This is an impressive temple worth visiting. The inside was beautiful and there were several areas around it to explore as well. Stunning views of the ocean from the path around the rocks. There are many people selling shells, children's plastic toys and sweets along the walk to the temple. You will have to leave your shoes and walk barefoot for a bit. Consider wearing socks if the sun has been heating up the ground. This place is more than a temple. Build on the kliff it offers several amazing views and hidden spots along the steps curling down the hill. The Kovil itself is really worth seeing - in mornings around 7-8 am there is a service where you can participate and see prayers. Not many tourists luckily but local people are very inclusive and welcoming... No photos alowed inside - what a pitty as there are some lovely coulourful 3D fresques. Definitedly worth a visit. Avoid going between 1 & 4 when there is no darshan. The view of the ocean is amazing from the staircase that goes down right across the main door of the temple. Best view of the ocean I have had in a decade. I went there with lot of expectations after reading the reviews, especially of the views from the top, since this temple is located up a small hill. Tuk Tuk will charge your 150 LKR from the bus stand. Fredrick. I reached there only by 6 p.m. Hence did not look at the fort and went up the hill to the temple. You will have to walk the last 50 yards to the temple. There is a place where you can leave your footwear. The views of the sea and other places is good but you do not get a direct unhindered view. There is no view point as such. You will have to see through fences or over the walls or through the trees. Neither do you have a place to sit  so that you can sit and enjoy the views. The temple is one of the five ishwaram temple in Sri Lanka for Lord Shiva. The temple complex is small. You can spend maximum 30 minutes here. This is such a wonderful temple. We went there during the pooja time and it was extremely good. Ravana's sward cut is a must see, it cannot be described. On the way to the temple you will find many deer. A nice place to visit especially during the afternoon puja. The temple complex has some interesting sights apart from the main temple. The locals are very friendly and welcoming and they might even invite you to join them in a simple meal after the puja. As with almost all kovils in Sri Lanka, pictures are not allowed inside the main temple but men do not have to take their shirts off. The puja itself is more subdued compared to the ones we have observed in other parts of Sri Lanka. prays time 6 am 8 am 11 am 4 pm , we can participating 11 am prayer, fruit baskets & coconuts can be purchased IN front of the temple, after the prayers they offering green gram milk rice ( Pongal rice )  & fruit salad. shorts are prohibited to enter the temple. we have to wear long sarong , skirts or leggings or trousers, children's can easily learn the history of the temple through the wall paintings & descriptions. what a celebration of colors, smells, sounds and more....located on a very nice spot, overlooking the trincomalee bay and has a vey nice market. Recommended This temple has a great location and contains some of the original artifacts that were once buried to hide them while the temple was destroyed.  It's interesting for its history, but its not the most stunning/elaborate of Hindu temples.  The large golden statue was hidden behind scaffolding when we visited.  The road up to the temple is lined with vendor stalls selling tourist wares. This location is at the tip of the land at a high point and as such offers great views. It has a rich Hindu legend and so my parents were keen to visit it. You need to reach the naval base and from there, the only way up is a tuk-tuk (auto-rickshaw in Indian). Very elaborate art on the walls depicting a lot of history. We also bought some local sweet-meats on our way back and they were delicious! A must thing to in Trinco & amazing view always make me visit. The whole area surrounded by water & green, the temple history portrait nicely on the walls. Highly recommend for nature lover & first time visitors. Best view of Trincomalee and the Temple is very impressive Colorfull with a lots of paintings, statues and sculptures: we loved this place! The Koneswaram temple is one of the main highlights of the east coast of Sri Lanka in Trincomalee. The temple is located high above the bay, and you can view the breathtaking and awe-inspiring scenery on all sides. The site is a religious pilgrimage for the Hindus and is also known as the Kailasa of the South. The Koneswaram temple is one of the five “Pancha Ishwarams” (abodes of Shiva) which has been built to worship Lord Shiva- the supreme God of Hinduism. This is a Historical attraction being located in the Fort Fedrick built by Pirtugese and built on the destroyed Gokanna Budhist Temple in 1620.  It is devoted to daisy Koneshwaran. A huge statue of him is built outside the temple. The temple and the statue are colourful. In any faith,  can visit inside but have to remove shoes and have to wear a modest dress covering the knees. Many devotees are seen worshiping and praying. This is famous for ladies to expect babies and they hang a small model of a cot for the purpose to get fulfilled. The view over sea is amazing. King Rawana' s cut from his sword which is also called as ""Lover's Leap"" is also nearby. During the day the sand is not  and I recommend you to wear shocks. With socks you can enter the temple also. There  are ladies found nearby that tell your future by seeing the hands. This was my dream from around 4 to 5 years to visit the holy place. I am truely grateful to the lord for giving me the opportunity. Best kovil I have seen eith so much history The temple on the shore next above the sea level and one of the most prominent places in Srilanka.It is well maintained and very clean.The view from the temple also isvery good. Beautiful Hindu temple dedicated to the gods of fertility. Beautiful views of the city and the ocean. You can see floating turtles in the sea and whales by telescope when you're lucky. Seeing the temple was an interesting experience. Please remember that if there are people who are not able to walk a long distance, they can go in a vehicle all the way up to the temple. There is a sign that says no vehicles are allowed but there are exceptions. Really blessed to be here is an amazing architecture,culture,the view is spectacular it’s a Hindu temple dates way back from 16th century if you come to Trincomalee is must visit destination. Excellent  beautiful place to visit. Its a place of worship for Hindus but people from all religions go there to get blessings. There's a belief that you will be blessed with child if you got blessings for this temple. Also you can get a beautiful view of Trincomalee sea from a very high level. You have huge rocks forming this location and one of the points is called loves leap. There's so many stories attached to this place I think you can google this stories. A must place to visit in Trincomalee. We’ve visited a TON of temple in our months travelling India and Srilanka and I have to say this is one of the most beautiful! It’s perched on the edge of a cliff (lovers leap) and the paint work inside and outside is second to none. Leading up the the temple there are lots of stalls selling bits and bobs (the sweet stalls are great). If you’re thinking I’ve seen enough, make this your last you won’t regret it You can walk to this place from Trinco town...try it... the view from the top is beautiful.... you can see beautiful seas from here... on the way to the top where you find the Statues u find many street shops where u good buy collectibles.souvenirs, food items etc. Have a visit if u travel to Trinco! No regret as all friends told to visit. Was there at 4pm and lucky as evening prayers started. Managed to join and have good view and blessing. Top view was good especially the ocean and the rocks. Picture scenic view from Top and deers freely every where. One of the must see if you are travelling on the eastern coast.  This is indeed a strategic place where you can have control over eastern part of Indian Ocean as nothing in between till Andaman Sea. The view of Lovers' Leap or Ravana's Cleft is beautiful. Also walking all over naked feet is another experience. Listening the Temple Bell at the time of sunset along with traditional music coming from inside was unique. I had seen a lot of Buddha buildings, so this was the first time I saw something of the Hindu religion! Very nice and beautiful, if you are in Trincomolee, please visit this place! Don't ever miss this amazing temple. If you need a closer darshan inside the temple, you need to wear dhoti or saree. Else you can see from outer Praharam. Dont miss the beautiful sunset.. The Tirukoneswaran Hindu temple is situated in such a beautiful area that it is so serene to look around and feel blessed. The temple itself is very rich in history as this is the place where Lord Rama is supposed to have installed the second lingam after he defeated King Ravana of Lanka, on Lord Shiva's instructions. Beautiful Temple. A lot of vibrations. Many other sites in the temple area to see such as the Ravana statue and the Ravana cut, which has its own story. Early morning is the best time to visit, less crowd and heat will be less.Pooja starts 6:30am, early morning. You could drive all the up to the kovil(if you are driving a car or a van). This temple is one of the two Shiva temple in the Island which got revered by Devaram poets from Tamil Nadu. Other temple is Ketheeswaram temple. Visited on an early morning excursion with the family. Love the rich colours of this temple and with few people around you got a definite sense of peace and calm which was appreciated. Lots of little nooks and crannies with different deities and enjoyed the views of the Indian Ocean as well. Would definitely recommend any travellers to Trinco to tick this exquisite temple off the list. very colorful temple, no pictures are allowed inside, very decent drawings with a lot of colors. as you walk to it you can see a lot of antelopes, very nice scenery of the sea and good souvenir shops (you must bargain to get a good price) This is an old Hindu temple here. The view from here is amazing. This is in the Fort Frederick army  camp. Koneswaram temple is very old and one of the most important Hindu temples in srilanka.. Very nice place with so much Divinity.. Lord shiva shower his unconditional love and blessings from this kovil. Temple has a long history of thousands of years and lot of miracles have taken place. The view from the temple is unbelievable and can see the beauty of trincomalee. A must place to visit Very beautiful place in Sri lanka.nice view. Important place in Hindu culture.we all worship this historical place.... Holy place to visit. Beautiful temple with a amazing view of the coastline. Lady selling juice was very friendly with natural juice with nice sitting arrangment overlying the beach The temple complex has lots of points of interest as well as being in a spectacular position. Lots of history to absorb and to see the worshippers performing various acts of belief was fascinating. Well worth a visit and allow at least half an hour or more. Nice walk up the hill with fantastic nature and animal life, from the top you get a nice view of the ocean and city. The temple is beatiful, we enjoyed the view and freshly pressed juice before heading down again. Really not to be missed! Very impressive, we arrived at 8 am during prayer. I recommend anyone a visit! Busy Hindu temple complex. You are not allowed to take pictures inside the temple. There are plenty of interesting statues and pictures of the Hindu Gods. Very colorful and alive. There are tame deer and peacocks in the area. A nice trip out, what a setting..set in a military fort you get to see a different side.  The temple is amazing, bare in mind the temperature of the floor as you do have to remove your shoes.... But lovely. Our tuktuk driver wanted to show us this place, because he wanted to visit the temple himself. It was really interesting to go with someone who was familiar with and reverent to each part of the temple and surrounds. There is a not to be missed main worship hall that has a awesome ceiling, full of figures, and don't miss the view from the front of rock, with the shines in the rock wall nooks. Everyone was was very happy and friendly. The fact that Buddhist monks were among the mix of demographics visiting a Hindu temple made our visit more rich and interesting. The deer were a bonus. Sitting on the cliff... when u enter you are greeted by a huge statue of Lord Shiva and this leaves you in awe. Within the temple also is the Shakti Peedam as it is the same area, just have to read the signs. We were fortunate to be in time for Darshan, was a great feeling! If you visit the Koneswaram temple you will see many of the most famous places in Sri Lanka. You have to go through the Fort Frederick which was built by Portugese during the time they invaded Sri Lanka on your way to the temple. This tour through take you back through the ages to the colonial times. One past the Fort buildings you have to walk up to the temple. It is Advisable to go there before 10,00 AM or after around 4.00 PM because the ground could be really hot and you have to walk bare foot. There are many impressive statues of Hindu gods in the temple. Within the temple premises is the famous 'lovers leap' a picturesque sight. On your way back visit the War Museum where you could see parts of ships built in 18 hundred as well as the weapons captured from the guerilla outfits LTTE and JVP. It is also an educational tour. If you go on a Sunday stroll down the Trincomalee city. I stayed at Sober Island Resort which is a good place to stay. Its a resort inside a sort of a jungle but you have to be recommended by a person in the SL Navy to book the resort. One of my favourite Hindu Kovils in Sri Lanka. Way to Thirukonrshvaram through Fort itself is full of amazing sceneries including dears both sides of the road. The small market just before the Kovil is also really colorful and last June I bought so many stuff from there. With my mediocre Tamil Proficiency I managed to learn a lot about Tamil kings and the history behind this Kovil. The view of the sea from the Kovil is simply magical. It´s a nice and peaceful place with a very good view. We walked up to the hill... would do it again... Come in the evening around 6 or 7 PM to see the amazing sunset from the top of the hill and the ceremony in the temple. One of the most beautiful temples we visited in Sri Lanka. Located inside the old fort and restoration is amazing. Try go when they are doing the 'Pooja' it is a soul touching experience. Recommended to walk from fort door as the walk is quite nice ( if you like walking ). View from the Kovil is breathtaking. Words cant say how beautiful it is. Great views from the top and a bunch of deer and peacocks were roaming about freely.  It's of great religious importance to Hindu folk as well. Located within an army camp and a lot of history to be discovered here. Most of the Hindu people visit this place, and its nice to see this Kovil. Young married ladies come here to wish for a baby with a huge faith. There are drawings inside the Kovil and it says many stories related to Hindu culture. It is a grand Temple dedicated to Lord Shiva. There are other shrines housing Ganesha, Murugan, Bhadrakali, Parvathi etc. On the entrance side sits Lord Shiva in the form of a big golden coloured statue. The Temple itself is perched atop the Konesar malai a hillock. The Temple is well maintained with poojas and other rituals. It is also known as  thousand pillared Temple. A huge temple god awaits you at the entrance. The souvenir shops up to the entrance with their plastic spoil the picture considerably. There are only a few traditional stalls in between - a shame. The temple is very colorful, but pleasant and worth a visit, especially for the great view over the bay. historic temple, but avoid going midday as one has to remove footwear & the road/ground gets far too hot -likely to end up with blisters This is an important Hindu temple and primarily a religious place. The sea views around the temple are stunning and lovers leap is beautiful although the sight has many sad endings!! The spotted deer that roam around are also worth a look. We enjoyed spending about 45-60 mins here but you could spend a lot longer. Well worth a visit if you are in the area. About 15min drive from Trinco Blu, this is on Fort Fredrick. An old temple , it is worth a visit. Super hot by the day, it is hard to walk barefoot. Main diety is Shiva. Didn't witness any special puja when we were there. Lovely ocean views from the top. Lot of over priced shops on the way to the temple. It was a beautiful temple located on top on the hill overlooking the indian ocean. We bought pooja tray from one of the stalls for reasonable price to experience the rituals and must say it was simple and tourist friendly. The priest was helpful and friendly, The pooja started on time and it was simple and short pooja. Thank you temple management for giving us this beautiful experience. We are told there are over 1800 steps but they are shallow and should not prove a problem for anyone of average fitness.  More of a challenge is getting to the final high spot over steep, smooth rock with a few footholds, there is a hand rail but you may have to let go to let people down!  You will need a head for heights at the top the barriers are low but the view is stupendous.  There are several other shrines on the way up with their own story and well worth the visit.  For more information visit the web page for the temple. This is a very special site which you should not miss in Trincomalee. One of the 5 most important religious sites in Sri Lanka. Amazing views and nice deer on the way back. Worth a visit because of the views. The temple is a temple. A lot of commercial stands before you enter. In terms of location,this temple is no1. Located at the top of a rockhill overlooking the Indian Ocean,i think no other temple can match its beauty. Its a very colourful temple with so much history and a lot of detailing. My only regret is was unable to see the giant koneswaram statue as it was under construction. Lots of deers and peacocks enroute the temple. The entrance is via the Fort Frederick...you feel like going back in time. I spent about 2 hours here. Rich in history, mystery and great people. The small walk towards Koneswaram is very interesting with handmade crafts and little toys for kids. Absolutely worth visiting when in trinco. Would recommend packing socks and wearing them when visiting as the ground gets almost unbearably hot in basement. Cash is required to pay for storing shoes. Visit this temple when a mass is going on! It´s an expierience you will not forget! Really a Must-See in Sri Lanka! The biggest tourist attraction is Koneswaram Temple, on a high clifftop overlooking the ocean. A temple was first established here around 500 BC, but when the Portugese took over around 1620, they demolished the temple and used stones from the rubble to build a fort at the base of the cliff. The fort remains and is now a military base, but the temple has been rebuilt and the site's antiquity attracts many pilgrims. Nice trip in 'trinc', views are superb, temple is beautiful Hindu piece of work, certainly worth the detour (entrance is free) On the top of the rock through the dutch fort. You can see the far waters of east beach from the top. Nice location We went there during late January and unfortunately it turned out to be a very hot day. You have to leave your transport a fair way from the temple and walk the rest of the distance bare foot. We found it very uncomfortable to walk on the tarmac which was  extremely hot for us. Managed to get as close as you can to get a good view of the temple  but could not venture in. I loved going to the temples because it helped broaden my perspective on different cultures and religions as well as my own. You have to go barefoot for a large portion of this temple which was fine for me and my wife but not everyone will be comfortable with it. A must see temple in Trincomalee with such a beautiful view. This temple holds a lot of history and is situated right by the water and looks out to the mountain. There are many street vendors and a cafe along the way if you want to grab a quick bite and buy souvenirs. Temple is located on top of a hill. Easy access & easy parking. A lot of small shops have been allowed between the car park & the temple which gives a bit of a commercial touch. View from top of the hill is fantastic. Lovers leap is situated adjoining the temple. Temple itself is very well maintained & worth a visit. To see, Hindu temple on the rocks after Fort Frederic. Saroung and long sleeve required to access the site Free The sacred temple is abode of Lord Shiva & is also a Shaktipeeth. There is also belief that Ravana mediatated & worshipped Lord Shiva at this place. There is also a Ravana cut rock. Truly amazing place to visit. At the top of a hill and with very beautiful views we found this temple, full of color, we couldn't go inside, but you take a walk around the perimeter... very curious... This was the temple that caught my eye and I wanted to go to Sri Lanka, Which I did in December 2018. Most amazing experience, beautiful temple and views of the sea was breath-taking A very colourful Hindu temple set high on the cliff above the sea. Very important Temple for Hindus. Am not a massive fan of temple visits. This ticked a box and would probably tick many for temple aficionados. This is one of my favourite temples I’m not Hindu but I alway feel drawn to this place. I’ve been 3 times now each time we visit Trincomalee. It’s beautiful, peaceful and full of history. I always wonder and marvel at how much energy, love, patience and hard work  goes into building these Hindu temples in Sri Lanka. Especially the hand painted shrines that surround the god statues. This Temple is built up high on the cliffs and we were told that young lovers that weren’t allowed to marry would come here and jump off the cliffs so they would be together forever. It’s know as Lovers Leap. The local people are also very friendly and welcoming but just be warned about the few people mainly ladies that will try and con you outside the temple at the end of the road. They insist on reading your palm for a price then tell you that you’re are cursed or put a curse on you and tell you it wil cost you more (a lot more) to remove it! Just downright cheeky! If you are visiting Tricomalee then this temple is a must. This is another must see place with religious and historic value. It also has a great surrounding of the gorgeous sea. People be dressed modestly . Must wear cloth below the knee. Avoid visiting during the afternoon because has direct sun light .suitable for morning or evening Visiting the Siva Ishwarams (Pancha Ishwarams) in Sri Lanka. The reunion with relatives in Jaffna took us to four of the Siva Temples in Sri Lanka during the first seven days of our Sri Lanka Odyssey. Our first stop, on March 3rd, was at the Munneswaram temple situated in a village in the Puttalam District. Hindus believe that it is one of the the five temples they need to visit in their life time. The others being Naguleswaram temple which we visited in Keerimalai in the Kankesanthurai district on March 4th and Thiruketheeshwaram in Mannar District and the Koneswaram temple in Trincomalee (Thirukonamalai) -- both the next day. All these, including Rameswaram in India form the five ancient temples (Ishwarams) dedicated to Shiva. According to Hindus, the Munneswaram temple near Puttalam is the temple where King Rama prayed to Shiva after killing Ravana to seek forgiveness over the death of many in the war. Hindus believe that the Naguleswaram temple's adjacent water tank, the Keerimalai Springs, has curative properties. The temple was largely destroyed by Jesuit missionaries following the Portuguese conquest of the Jaffna kingdom, restored by Arumuga Navallar in 1894. The Thiruketheeshwaram temple had existed for more than 2,400 years. During our visit to this temple, we witnessed a temple devotee from Vavunia singing Thevarams. His aim was to complete the 800 thurmurai thevarams in one month. The Trincomelee Koneswaram temple was built by the Cholas/Pandian kings. The temple is situated atop Konesar Malai, at a commanding position overlooking the Indian Ocean. It is also known as the ""Mount Kailash of the South"". The temple, mentioned in Mahabaratha and Ramayana, was visited by Arunagirinathar and is the easternmost shrine of the five ancient Ishwarams of Shiva on the island. The Temple is situated on top of a hill, not far from the entrance to Trincomalee Harbour. The statue is spectacular and the interior of the Temple looks interesting. There are shops at the entrance to the Temple. We reached the temple in the morning and had a good darshan. This temple is close to the shore. You will be able to see the sea from the top of the temple. The temple follows rituals as in Tamil Nadu. Once you enter the temple, you have the presiding deity of  lord shiva. You can easily spend 30 to 45 minutes in this temple. This is MUST visit temple in Sri Lanka. You enter the temple after a nice walk down a winding road. As you turn into temple you see a HUGE statue of Lord Shiva - in bright blue ! The temple is not very big (unlike its counterparts in India), but airy and roomy. And  not very crowded like most temples in Sri Lanka... As you walk around the temple, its 2000+ year history begins to get into you ! The Bay looking stunning on the eastern periphery of the temple. Caution - the walk from the place you remove the footwear to the covered portion of the temple can be cruel on sensitive feet ! We reached at noon - and we really felt the heat. So plan your visit before 10 am or after 4 pm, if possible. We visited this famous Koneswaran Temple situated on Swamy Rock within Fort Fredrick on 5th May 2018.  The vehicle park is about 150 metres from the temple itself.  After that we walked along the path leading to the temple.  All along the path are little shops selling various curios, flower and other offerings.  On the way up we saw some deer who seemed to be quite used to the crowds.  It is a safe haven for the here as they are quite safe and are protected. At the end of the path beyond a few steps is the statue of God Siva seated in lotus position, with its vehicle, the bull name Nandi.  This is a grand structure and stands out majestically as you approach the temple.  We came to the entrance to the main temple after passing this Siva statue.  Though we went inside to look at the grand sculptures and paintings, photographs were forbidden. A little beyond the temple entrance the view outside into the sea is beautiful, with many fishing boats.  The sheer drop at one of these places is called the “lover’s leap” where a distraught lady flung herself to the watery grave after watching her lover, a member of the Dutch foreign service, sailing away back to Holland. What struck me most were the little colourful baskets, said to be small versions of baby cots, hanging on one of the trees towards the sea side under flags of various colours.  These are offerings from childless couples asking for divine intervention for them to have their baby. We spent a thoroughly enjoyable morning visiting this beautiful and historic location. Koneswaram Temple is an  Interesting Place to visit and study. A history of decades and we had a wonderful time. Very crowded, interesting place. You dont see many tourists there. On the way to the temple you can buy tacky, chinese stuff and snacks. The temple is worth to see. Very colorful and the way through the Fort is nice This temple is profound. One must experience it. Make sure to wear traditional dress if you want to do pooja offering. This is a good trip to provide some variety from lying on the beach. There are great views from the bay from the top. I would recommend getting a tuk tuk up and walking back down. It is something local and cultural. Not touristic. Be there when Pooja happens. You will see lot of local devotees and their culture. This is situated inside the Trinco fort. An especially important place for Hindu people of Sri Lanka. even though it is Hindu religious place anyone can go and witness the ceremony. We have gone there at 6.30 A.M which is the best time in the morning. morning ceremony starts at 6.30 and you can witness typical Hindu music and traditional items there. Don't forget to go to the rock edge where you can see the sun rising from the horizon. it's a great view. Have a taste on sweets on the way. Deers are a common site in the area. We visited the temple after a dolphin watching boat trip (highly recommended) - and although the temple is of historic significance in the local area, there isn't alot to it. We only really spent 20 minutes here - just to put it into perspective? I've seen a few temples and sacred places, but I did not like this one at all. I don't understand all the positive reviews... Ok, the spot above the ocean is nice and the path to the temple is also very peaceful with those chunky trees and the deer around... But the temple itself was very dirty and not really nice. No interesting paintings or other things, very impersonal... Oh there were some monkeys... but that's it ;) A pretty little temple with outstanding views over the bay , stalls are lining the road up to it with the usual temple tat . Very pleasant . accessible to everyone. A kovil with a long history. Thers a viewpoint inside the premises. Beware of monkeys on the way could grab your food from hand. Can see lot of deers who are friendly and wont runnaway from you. Remove your slippers when entering. Shorts are not desirable. There is parking available at this temple free of charge. The walk to the temple is quite short but a little on the hilly side. There are stalls selling offerings to take with you to the temple and also stalls selling drinks and ice-creams. Once you get closer to the temple you have to remove your shoes as usual and pay Rupees 20.00 to reclaim them again. The ground in the afternoon to the temple once you remove your shoes can be rather challenging as it becomes very hot. The temple itself is well worth a visit and the views from the top are truly magnificent. Sadly there are many spotted deer that have taken residency next to the temple, and have begun to beg for food from the devotees. Many people, including ourselves, stop to take photographs of the resident spotted deer. I only hope that people do not get them too familiar with begging for food due to feeding, that they completely forget how to forage for themselves. Pretty, lively and lovely with a real sense of occasion, was even blessed. Hot in the day and you have to take your shoes off, hard for westerners in 40 degree heat. Great place - go! I have never seen a temple that is built on edge of a beach cliff. You can easily find deers and peacock casually moving along with the peoples. You can also find few shops on the way to temple. One of the famous places to visit in tricomalee. we went on December 10th early morning..it was so beautiful, This temple is located inside Fort Frederick, which still operates as a military fort.  The temple is located right at the end of the peninsular.  It is a fabulous location for a busy hindu temple.  I got the impression that the temple itself is quite modern, but that does not detract from its drama The level of details in this Hindu temple was impressive. We unfortunately missed the pooja (prayer). You should plan to be there at the right time, so you get the full experience. 30-45 min drive from Trinco city. A beautiful and historic temple overlooking China Bay. It is our first visit to the place and learned that in 17th century Portuguese invaders demolished it and robbed of all valuable, killed all priest in an attempt to convert hindus to christianity (or just blood thirsty and looting). It only rebuilt  in 1950s after discovery of relics by Arthur C Clark and town council of Trincomalee. A must see place in Trinco. One of the most important Hindu temples on the East Coast of Sri Lanka; it's usually very busy and so it's worth observing the religious practice of the visitors. Taking photos inside is forbidden, except if you are so lucky as to witness a Hindu wedding there (as we were :) ) This is one of the beautiful Hindu Temple around the country. mainly with the location is very attractive, from this location you can see the city and Ocean.This Hindu Temple has a long History with God Shiva, and King Rawana. This is a famous kovil/ temple among Sri Lankans - specially among the Tamil people. Good place for foreigners to experience the culture and religion of people in this area. Better to go in the morning - since the weather is usually hot. If you want to participate to the Pujawa - you have to first pay Rs. 100 and take a ticket and then go to the Sami with that for Pujawa. Tickets are issued inside the temple. We had a wonderful experience to worship that kovil temple. It located Beautiful area surrounding the ocean.it's a best experience we had. An amazingly detailed and painted temple. The figures of Hindu mythology are a treat to see. A functional and busy temple that's definitely worth a look. Colourful and lively, great views from vantage points, locals offering fruit everywhere (felt bad declining the fifth banana). A nice clean and peaceful temple surrounded by indian ocean. Prayers start at 6.30 am and then from 8.30am till 11.30am. Need to park a distance away and walk up the temple. There are shops along the way to buy the neccessary prayer items. You may see deers on the way up to the temple. Many Sri Lankan used to visit this kovil in expecting babies. Anyhow the scenery you would enjoy is priceless and couldn't find such high-sight view of Trincomalee sea from any place here. Following a gentle walk up to the temple passed a few stalls selling hats and souvenirs we saw the colourful statue with the temple behind. We were privilaged to be allowed to join a ceremony  and (we are female) local females showed us what to do. We bought a ticket at a kiosk to give to the priests to bless us. The temple is beautiful inside but no pictures allowed. Behind the temple were lots of little cradles hung on trees for fretility wishes. Beautiful views out to sea and across the bay. We ended with a cool orange juce in the cafe on the hill where we watched the sun set. The Koneswaram temple is one of most holy Hindu shrines to the god Shiva in Sri Lanka and is well worth a visit. It is easily approached by car or the ubiquitous tuk tuk readily hired close to most local tourist hotels around Trincomalee town. The high rock on which the temple stands gives great views out to sea and coast. Be aware that the dropping off point is a hundred yards or so from the temple near a range of souvenir stalls. The last part of the approach requires bare feet (this can be a bit hard on the feet) as is usual when visiting shrines and shoes can be deposited in a rack for this purpose. The temple and surrounds are lavishly decorated with colourful statutes and a number of dioramas illustrating stories from the lives of the gods. This is a must see place if one visits Trinco. It is very easy to reach and you can take your vehicle quite close to the temple. It tells you many epic stories about the hindu gods and also offers some spectacular views (Ex: Lovers Leap). The views get even better if the sun is out nice and bright. Don't forget to see the Portuguese cemetery on your way. Before you get to the temple you are asked to take off your shoes. It is nice to walk through the temple grounds and take a few photos. Inside the temple, however, you are not allowed to take photos. If you have a few minutes to spare, stop by one of the cafes on the side on the road and enjoy a cold drink and a panoramic view of Trinco. Also, be aware that taxis and tuk-tuks are not allowed too close so you will have to walk a few minutes before getting there. We family of 12 with chidren visited in the evening  .nice atmosphere, there are 3 wheelers who charge rs100 for tranporting from car park who cannot walk. It is surrounded by sea .this the temple where ravana worshipped lord shiva. For us- Europeans - it was the first experience with hindu temple. Very colourful, you experience a different culture by many sences - aroma sticks, colours, barefoot. If you pay 100 rupees, you get blessing from the monk.very nice, I recommend it. If you visit Trinco you should not skip this place. When the time we visit this temple there were very less crowd. What a nice and calm place in Trincomalee and also you can see a large number of deers in and around the temple. I highly recommend this place for all type of visitors. Koneswaram Temple of Trincomalee (Tamil: திருக்கோணேச்சரம் கோயில்) or Thirukonamalai Konesar Temple – The Temple of the Thousand Pillars and Dakshina-Then Kailasam (Southern / Ancient Kailash) is a classical-medieval Hindu temple complex in Trincomalee, a Hindu religious pilgrimage centre in Eastern Province, Sri Lanka. The most sacred of the Pancha Ishwarams of Sri Lanka, it was built significantly during the ancient period on top of Konesar Malai, a promontory overlooking Trincomalee District, Gokarna bay and the Indian Ocean. The monument contains its main shrine to Shiva in the form Kona-Ishvara, shortened to Konesar. What a colourful and nice temple this is in Trincomalee. After you entered Ford Frederick you have to walk a bit towards the temple; we did this late afternoon which was great with regard to the heat. Outside there is a large statue of the Godess Shiva which is impressive. Inside there are lots of colourful statues to see; we were lucky as a ceremony just started when we arrived. Be aware, at an Hindu temple women need to wear a sarong and you have to enter without shoes. Very beautiful maintained tempel that's definatly worth a visit when you're in trincomalee. Keep in mind you need to cover your knees and shoulders If you are a Meditation expert,  Nature lover, person like to see the wolrd in a lonely place, please make sure to visit this place,,, If you have Reiki  expert you ahve more to Feeel I like temples so this was high on my list.  It sits on the hill at the top of the cliffs at the end of the peninsula with great views.  The temple itself is impressive with fascinating pictures and artefacts.  If you like temples, this is a great visit. The temple was beautiful. Situated in the east of Sri lanka trincomalee and overlooking the Indian Ocean. The temple is filled with cultural significance. It is said that ravana used to pray here to shiva along with his mother and is also said to have brought the lingam from kailash. It has been destroyed once by tsunami, once by the tsunami and is the third construction standing now. As one of the 5 Siva temples in Sri Lanka this is a must to see and experience. Great views out to sea from here as well. This place Is worth visiting, lot of free running animals. And beautifull view on to the sea. The temple is very color full Ravan wanted to cut off the temple from the mountain it was on to let his mother, who was ill, have darshan. As he was cutting it away he got news of her demise.and rushed back.there is a huge cleft between the rocks which is called Ravana's cut, There is a lovely viewing gallery for looking out at the sea. the temple itself is relatively new as it had been destroyed by the Dutch in 1614 and was later reconstructed but a real worth it visit. I've already reviewed this temple as part of my review of Fort Frederick, which you have to pass through to reach the temple.  It's very colourful with lovely paintings and statues showing the destruction by the Portuguese of the original temple built on this site.  There is an enormous Hindu god statue next to the temple, and several small shrines among the rocks nearby.  Anyone is allowed to enter the temple as long as they remove shoes and headgear.  It is one of the most important temples in Sri Lanka, and receives a lot of visitors. While I stood through the morning service I can't pretend to really understand what was going on but the Faithful were clearly enraptured by the spectacle. Later we went along the cliff-edge path with great views of the ocean. Those unused to walking barefooted should be aware that you have to leave your shoes a fair distance from the temple so socks may be a good idea in the heat of the day. A very  religious place where people from all religions visit when in Trincomalee.and a very religious place and as a Very long history.it's Location is fantastic An interesting place to visit of great religious importance to Hinduism, in a nice location on the top of the hill overlooking the Indian ocean. Bright colourful drawings and sculptures on the walls and statues with vivid colours very common in Hindu temples. There are deer and peacocks on the way to the temple and many vendors. The only negative comment is the trash everywhere and the bad smell. Definitely worth a visit if you're in the area. Large statue of Shiva is impressive. Setting is quite extraordinary, perched on a promontory above the sea. On the walk up to the temple there are a number of wild deer running around. Around the entrance are a number of market stalls selling food, drink and souvenirs. King coconut drinks are cheap if you haggle. The temple is very vibrant and colourful, and also busy. Women are given extra robes to cover of up if required. Shoes are looked after for 20 rupee. Temple has great views of the main bay. Would recommend the walk up there. We walked up from Trinco and enjoyed walking through the army base and seeing all the deer. Small entry fee and remember to cover up. Temple was very colourful with lots of ancient relics. Is currently under construction so some bits were covered up. View of the sea is amazing - whilst there we saw loads of huge jellyfish in the sea! Worth a visit if you want some time away from the beach! This a very important place in trincomalee.even in sri lanka.wonderful place snd its fantastic.you can view whale trincomalee city from this place And this place has very powerful mythology.its a valuble ancient place in sri lanka This was a great holy place to visit I visited this Kovil with my husband and daughters so many travellers came to this holy land This Ancient Temple located on a rocky outcrop overlooking the ocean is a must for all visitors to Sri lanka.  Sacred to Hindus , is also full of history and hindu culture.   A lot to see and absorb in the design and architecture of the temple.    Modest dress and no footwear I recently visited the Koneswaram Temple.  It is a small temple, and nice for a quick visit. You have to take your shoes off a way before the temple and it is very uncomfortable walking on the gravel up to the temple. No idea why they don't put something down over the gravel. Hard for tourists to walk on this and also the ground gets very hot. I visited Thirukoneswaram Kovil in Trincomalee last week, and once again it reminded me why this temple is so special. This was my third visit, and every time I come here, the experience feels new, peaceful, and deeply spiritual. The moment you step inside the kovil, you can feel the calmness. The sea breeze, the ancient architecture, and the powerful energy of the place make your mind completely relaxed. The view from the top is truly breathtaking — the blue ocean stretching far beyond your eyes. It feels like nature itself is giving you a blessing. The temple premises are well maintained and very clean. Watching people pray with devotion, hearing the bells, and standing in front of Lord Shiva’s sanctum gives a beautiful sense of peace. Every visit makes me feel more connected to my faith and culture. If you are visiting Trincomalee, Thirukoneswaram Kovil is a must-visit, not just for religious reasons but also for the history, beauty, and the peaceful atmosphere it offers. I know this won’t be my last visit — this temple always pulls me back with its divine charm. Another  very colourful temple, but in a spectacular location, and so colourful and bright.  Worth the visit for the views and lovers leap. Few stalls on the way up that have some interesting local food. Very colourful place high on a cliff top. You have to leave your shoes at a booth before you can proceed to the temple. Knees to be covered sarongs available at the door if required. Should have worn socks as the ground was so hot a bit uncomfortable to say the least. Plenty of stalls along the way. It's a great temple with lots of action going on. Drums and trumpets playing in a very nice and colorful temple. Lots to see for people who are new to Hinduism. The view from Swami Rock is great aswell, especially during sunset. Would advise to go one way at least by Tuk Tuk if you stay in Trincomalee. This temple is beautiful and it's free. You can see the locals pray and catch a great view of Trinco. Women should cover shoulders and legs. They do have covers available at the entry. We were pleasantly surprised by how much we enjoyed this. Thirukoneswaram or the Holy Koneswaram Temple, is a Hindu temple in Trincomalee on the east coast of Sri Lanka.The temple lies on a high rock.It surrounded on three sides by the sea. Loved this Hindu temple, so bright with its beautiful paintings and statues. Very movi g and spiritual place with an i teresti g yet sad story of the girl who lost her lover and jumped into the ocean.  Beautiful setting over looking the sea. A must visit a little wark up to the temple ...quiet...u can see alot of deers on the road ...view from on top of the rock is nice  ..has a history .... I´ve visited many temples of a wide variety of religions in many countries. I never saw an advertisment like the one they have in the entrance. It seems they are quite rigid!! Visited temple on Saturday morning, so it was super busy, even more - there was wedding happening, with couple receiving blessing (if that's how it's called) - it was amazing to see and was our highlight of visit to Trincomalee, which in off season was very quiet. I also found people around temple very welcoming (I saw maybe about 5 more people besides us who were not local), lots of sales booths, but no one bothered us. Unless you are interested in participating in the rituals go in the evening about 4 p.m.  Lots of visual and cultural interest outside, especially as no photography is allowed inside. The Koneswaram Hindu Temple is definitely a 'must see' when in Trincomalee. One has to walk for a few minutes along the road leading to it (with no shoes), then a short climb up into the Temple itself. You pass numerous street vendors selling sweet foods, hats and souvenirs. The Temple itself is a masterpiece of architecture and Hindu decorations and art work. Apart from the glory of the Temple one can enjoy superb panoramic views from the grounds, overlooking the town and distant beaches. A gorgeous and beautifully located temple full of friendly worshippers. Colourful and glorious. An easy walk. The sweet looking cow outside the temple is actually an attack cow... beware! Best place in Sri Lanka 🇱🇰✌🏽visit this if your in trincomalee for many years this god has given blessings to all our country THIRUKONESWARAM HINDU TEMPLE, TRINCOMALEE Koneswaram hindu temple located in trincomalee the eastern capital of srilanka. This place have a long history and a heritage of a hindu's.  Devotees pray here four times a day. [6 a.m/ 8 a.m / 11 a.m/ 4 p.m]. You have to wear long dresses because shorts dresse prohibited to enter the place.Couples hoping become parents come to this place because of the trust in their hearts.This is like a heaven in srilanka and highly recommend for nature lover and tavellers. Nice visit for free! You can also visit fort Frederic and a Buddhist temple there everything is free Entry! The solfiers there are very nice and caring that No Tourist pays money for something free! Nice people. Climb the Fort Frederick hill and the temple is at the top.One of the more interesting of the dozens of Hindu Temples that you will visit. It is one of the three principal places of worship dedicated to Shiva. There are no photos inside but great water views outside. In the afternoon they have a special ceromony with lots of drums and music. Nice setting on a cliff  high above the sea. Mainly frequented by local Hindus who can purchase in one of the stalls along the road leading up to the temple. Some tourists also stop here on their way to a beach resort. On hot days the ground can burn your feet outside the temple so you might want bring socks... this Temple with a connection to ancient history is worth a visit.   A place sacred to the Hindu people, so no footwear, no head gear, and no photos.   Can watch a pooja ceremony  conducted by the hindu priests Grate Hindu Temple. Best time to visit early in the morning. Lot of visitors from all over the world visit this temple. Was lovely and cool inside this air conditioned restaurant which was a bonus. Kids had pizzas which were fine but sadly my nasi gorang was burnt and every mouthful tasted of burnt rice which was very disappointing. I'm not one to complain but I won't be going back. Also were bothered by flies so waiter positioned a fan next to the table to try and blow them away from our food! This is a really lovely Hindu Temple in a great setting, up on a hill, right by the ocean.  There are various caves and niches in the rocks that have been used to house some of the Hindu idols / artifacts. One of the best Hindu Temples in Sri Lanka. Dravidian architecture, colourful paintings & statutes of gods make this temple colorful and glamours. A must visit attraction when in Trinco! Recommended for families with children! This is a beautiful temple with a lot of old artifacts and history dating back to the time of King Ravana. The location is fabulous, with views of the Trincomalee town and the beaches from the temple. Took a tuk-tuk to this temple, well worth a visit. There are market stalls trying to sell you stuff as you walk up to the temple.  The temple is is good condition and is set on a cliff with lovely views of the sea. We accidentally forgot our longer clothes and thankfully there was some we could borrow (20rupees) to use. The shoe man who minds your shoes cost 20rupees also-just to be aware. But it was lovely and afterwards we stopped at the first stall on the right as you’re going back down and got a lovely king coconut and pineapple juice (best I’ve had on the trip!) drank them overlooking the ocean and the town of Trincomalee as the sun was starting to set-heaven! The place where temple is located is very beautiful, specially in evening. Historical background also nice. can see the bay and trincomalee city nicely. Got a tuk tuk to the temple which is at the top of the hill. The temple itself is very beautiful. There was a ceremony going in when we visited but we were still welcome to enter- just couldn't take photos inside the actual temple - only outside. The view of the ocean, beaches and town is amazing. We then walked back down the hill - through the market along the road - and down through the Fort to the fort entrance. At the entrance to the temple you leave your footwear in a basket, you get given a ticket, and on return you collect your footwear and pay a 10 rupee fee. This temple is a must visit. We went up to the temple but was not permitted to drive up all the way up the hill to the temple as there was a problem with the historic arch leading up to the temple. There was water leaking from beneath the arch and the authorities were worried that it might collapse. so we walked up the rest of the way which was a few hundred from where we had parked our coach. The temple and it architecture was beautiful and it s location on the hilltop overlooking the bay was beyond description.The view from the temple across the bay was fantastic. We even sighted a peacock in the vicinity of the temple in the bushes surrounding the temple hill side.We spent about twenty minutes in the temple and having prayed left and walked back. As you cant wear your shoes into the temple, there is a small stall on the left hand side as you near the temple where you can leave your shoes for a small token sum. All of you in the group can put your shoes/ sandals or slippers in one compartment. A number of the closet holding your shoes will be given to you to collect them on your return. the temple is worth a visit as it is of historical interest. If you are into temples then worth a look because its built on the hill and the scenery is worth the trip ,you will have to go through the local market place to get their, as usual the markets are full of local produce all very snuggery so be aware you diabetics , and pick the stall that has a cover over the food because the place can be full of flies , do keep your hand bags secured or the monkeys will have a field day pulling things out that you do not want anyone to see. I am not into pagan worship mind you we do have a lot of pagans ruling our world at present. This place is a Hindu temple for god Shiva. you can get a very nice view of surroundings and sea from here. they charge high for keeping your shoes.that is not acceptable. It was the weekend when I visited and also a festival, people friendly. I was the only westerner on this occasion. I think more tourists visit at other times Koneswaram temple is known as Thirukoneswaram & as Southern Kailasa. It's a must to visit Hindu temple. Main deity is God Shiva , Goddesses Parvathy & God Ganapati, along with other deities. They do puja rituals & if we ask they will give vibhooti/ bhasmam packed in covers. Located in one of the most beautiful locations in Sri Lanka, it is a must visit for the travelers. A religiously important place as well It was difficult to visit and hard to understand what they were doing in the rebuilding. Needed more interpretative signs in English It was an amazing experience. Have a marvelous scenery at the top of the rock. I recommend everyone to visit this place. This temple is placed inside an army fort just at the top of a hill. Must leave your footwear at the entrance paying 20RS fee. Nice views of the bay but as everything in this country full of plastics and rubbish around :( This was the second time i visited the temple. You have to park it and climb a small mountain to go to the temple. its inside the fort. along the way there are many shops to buy local sweets, arts and crafts. please wear clothes that do not reveal bare arms and thighs if not you have to cover. For me a person who has never bee to India, seeing hinduism practiced in front of me was an eye opening experience. The temple's architecture is fascinating! Koneswaram Kovil is dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva. It is located at the head of Swami Rock on the Gokarna Bay, which a seasonal home to blue whales. The temple sits on a high ground above the bay of Trincomalee. This is also a prominent pilgrim center for Hindus and, is of a great religious value. It provides a jaw-dropping scenery on all sides. Perched atop a hill and surrounded by the serene blue ocean, this beautiful and ancient Hindu temple is a true haven of tranquility. Nestled within the historic Fort Frederick, the temple offers a peaceful retreat for those seeking a moment of calm. At the start of the road leading to the temple, there is a parking area available. Visitors can wear slippers up to the temple’s entrance, where a small facility is provided to safely store them for a modest fee while you explore the temple. As you make your way toward the temple, the path is lined with street vendors offering a variety of souvenirs, giving you the chance to take home a piece of the experience if your visit tricomali, this certainly is a comfortable place which is inevitable. you can feel clearly of the local flavor, but buy something local with local price too A great Hindu temple on the cliffs. Very colourful and interesting to visit, seeing the locals coming to worship and making oferrings I was in August of 2014 looking the restoration and I come back last month to check it. The works of restoration was amazing. If you will go, I recommend read first about the history to enjoy better this Temple. I will come back again sure! Namaste! Such a ""BEAUTIFUL"" place with so much history! I seriously don't have words to describe. Plus the day we went there,was so much crowded because it was a long weekend vacation here in SriLanka,so many people were their to enjoy the eastern atmosphere! This is a very famous place among all religion. They have magnificent statues. Can see the whole trinco city when you reach there. This temple is amazing - the location on the cliffs with a beautiful ocean view; the vibrant colours and the calm, special feel about it. I’m not Hindu but I could sense why this place is sacred. No entry fee made a nice change. Really enjoyed spending some time there. A most religious place in Hinduism.And my brother explained a lot about this kovil before our family visiting here..nice view of the sea covering this kovil.and atmosphere and religious beliefs peaceful nature.We thought to visit.it was really nice memory I ever had.hope to go there again next year It is a place of worship for Hindus and everyone can go to watch it. This Kovil has a long history. This temple is located on top of a hill. Surrounded by the dramatic Swami Rock and Gokarna Bay, the classical-medieval complex is Trinco’s biggest draw. The site is a major Hindu pilgrimage center, and one of the Pancha Ishwarams (five abodes of Shiva) built in Sri Lanka to honor one of the principle deities of Hinduism. This temple is situated in the village of Thambalagamuwa that was part of the medieval semi-independent feudal division called Thambalagamuwa Pattu. Prior to the arrival of Portuguese in 1622 and then Dutch colonial overloads in 1656, leaders of the Thambalagamuwa Pattu and others around it were independent rulers sometimes subject to Jaffna kingdom or Kandyan kingdom. The location of the temple makes it all the more beautiful. We visited the temple when a local ritual was on and the sound of the drums was mesmerizing. Gorgeous colourful temple situation on a cliff overlooking the ocean, very interesting place to see! A place with a great history. You can get a beautiful sight of the Indian ocean. Try and visit in the evenings as you have to take off your shoes entering the premises and the beach sand on the location gets really hot This is a very nice place and a must that you must do when visiting trinco. At night this place is soo calm and quiet that you can visit with your husband.Remember that the show protecting people will stop their job after 7pm The colors and decoration of this Hindu Temple certainly catch the eye. I would recommend visiting during a service in order to obtain an idea of the ritual and solemnity of the place. This location is accessed through the fort. You walk for about 1km from the car park to the temple gate. Along the way you see some interesting sites, there are plenty of vendors selling goods, but our highlight was stopping and enjoying freshly squeezed passionfruit juice while overlooking the sea below. 250lkr for a good size glass. Remove your shoes and cover up, then be prepared for a very colorful exhibit both outside and in. Walk around a Hindu temple barefoot. Look at the ocean and get a taste of Tamil culture. Just a short walk from the bus station. Not to mention the very tame deer. The best part of this location is you can get a breathtaking view of Trinco harbour. Apart from it, it's typical Hindu temple with lot of statues. You feel relaxed when going inside the temple. A temple that must be visited. Stunning view of the Indian Ocean from the temple hill rock. A unique view and location, which no temple even in India offers Fort prederick is most visiting place for tourists and it is a beautiful place in Trincomalee and many Deers around here can see. One of the most important and holy Hindu temples in Sri Lanka, open all hours, gives you a good feel of the local Tamil culture. The Temple of the Thousand Pillars and Dakshina-Then Kailasam (Southern / Ancient Kailash) is a classical-medieval Hindu temple complex in Trinco, a Hindu religious pilgrimage centre in Eastern Province, Sri Lanka. The most sacred of the Pancha Ishwarams of Sri Lanka, it was built significantly during the ancient period on top of Konesar Malai, a promontory overlooking Trincomalee District, Gokarna Bay and the Indian Ocean. The monument contains its main shrine to Shiva in the form Kona-Ishvara, shortened to Konesar. The complex was destroyed in colonial religious attacks between 1622 and 1624 and a fort was built at the site from its debris. A 1632-built temple located away from the city houses some of its original idols. Worldwide interest was renewed following the discovery of its underwater and land ruins, sculptures and Chola bronzes by archaeologists and Arthur C. Clarke. It has been preserved through restorations, most recently in the 1950s. Granted ownership of villages in its floruit to form the Trincomalee District, Trincomalee village is located on the cape isthmus within the compounds. Revenue from the temple provides services and food to residents. Koneswaram has many strong historical associations. The shrine is described in the Vayu Purana, the Konesar Kalvettu and Tevaram hymns by Sambandhar and Sundarar as a Paadal Petra Sthalam along with its west coast Ishwaram counterpart Ketheeswaram temple, Mannar, and was praised for its tradition by Arunagirinathar upon his visit. The Dakshina Kailasa Puranam and Manmiam works note it as Dakshina/Then Kailasam (Mount Kailash of the South) for its longitudinal position and pre-eminence, it lies directly east of Kudiramalai west coast Hindu port town, while it is the easternmost shrine of the five ancient Ishwarams of Shiva on the island. This religious temple is well-preserved for all devotees and we have a lot of respect and believe in Lord Shiva as Sri Lankans. As Sri Lankans, we pay to visit the said temple and pay our utmost humble respect and worship Lord Shiva whenever we visit Trico or pass by this lovely town at any given time. People from all over the world visit this temple. It was an amazing feeling to visit back the said temple grounds with my family during our visit to Trinco again. We will always retain the said temple since we are so blessed to have the said temple in such holly /religious grounds of Trinco the history left behind and around the old port of Trinco which is one of the most amazing natural harbours of the world the said temple is amazing to watch to any visitors around the world. One of the most beautiful temples I have been to in my life time, the sculpture and paint is so detailed and it’s not just outside it more amazing inside This is a beautiful, spiritual Hindu temple located on top of a large hill/ mountain in Trincomalee, fully accessible by road and by foot. The carvings, paintings and religious artefacts are amazing and very interesting, with English texts providing guidance as to meanings etc. The views are also stunning, with views over the bay. Definitely worth a visit if in Trincomalee. After a stroll up through many stalls selling drinks and offerings for the temples, you leave your shoes at the minder and wander up to the top of the hill.  It is a lovely temple with great paintings and an interesting collection of ""cots"" hanging in the trees -offerings from those hoping to have children. Many boats come here so the fishermen can come and pray before going out to sea. The temple has laid in ruins, been restored and enlarged over the years, and it became one of if not the most important surviving classical Dravidian structures by the 17th C. The views of the ocean are beautiful from this temple. generally very interesting.  Take the time to read some of the explanations on the walls. This is situated on a rock next to the sea. The Sea around this area is known to be very deep. Better to visit either in the morning or in the evening as it is hard to keep walking in barefoot, due to the heat. It is a Hindu temple but a small one . Found probably manny years ago and seems to be a temple for blessing to have more children. A seaside view from the temple that is on the cliff do have a great look of the Indian Ocean ! You prepare to pay and remove your shoes to walk there! Do prepare to wear a modest dress when visiting . The temple is very interesting, overlooking the ocean. It affects the strong spirituality. The entrance road is full of stalls but what is striking are the garbage and fawns Please definitely visit this place IF you wish to see the true beauty of Trincomalee. The breathtaking view and the holy place is just taking you away from this world. This place is definitely worth visiting. There are many beautiful temples. Very colorful and historical. I highly recommend. A beautiful temple located on the cliff with a amazing view of the ocean. The history of the temple either written in sinhala or tamil language. If someone could explain about the stories the visit would be more interesting. It is one of the most important Hindu temples, indeed sacred complexes, in Sri Lanka. It is located in a scenic position overlooking the sea and to get there you need to enter the area of the fort. At the entrance there are many small shops especially food and many people: pilgrims, school children. You must leave your shoes outside the complex and then, hopping in the patches of shadow, get to the temple ""of a thousand columns"". The temple itself is beautiful but what makes it very special is the location. You must be dressed comfortably (shoulders and legs covered). Admission is free. This would be one o the things to do ar Trincomale apart from enjoying the beach. The temple is up a hill and quite a walk from the bus station so preferably take a tuk-tuk uphill. The temple is nothing great but does give you great views of Trinco. There are any small shops lining the temple. On your way back walk downhill which is pretty pleasant and worth the effort. Very low key Hindu temple. The paintings are excellent and tell the story really well. Very life like. One of the few places you see Ravana and the entire Shiva family together. The priests leave you alone and have no expectation of any money. It was the first time we went to a Hindu temple. It was impressive, lots of people and lots of stalls where locals sell their products. This is a beautiful temple , breathtaking and enormous. We had a lovely trip from Uppuvelie in a three wheeler.  On the way we stoped to see Swung by when we were in the Trinco centre and very much enjoyed looking around the temple. It doesn’t take too long to visit but looks very cool! This Indu temple is simply amazing with a wonderful view on the sea! Absolutely worth going! Dont miss it! This Temple is a medieval temple dedicated to the lord Shiva. 17th century inscriptions state that the temple has been around even in 1580 BC. The temple is located on top of a rock (Konesar Malaio Swami Rock) overlooking the Indian Ocean. Also the beautiful stone sculptures depict many events in the temples history such as the destruction of the shrine by Dutch, creation of the Kinniya hot water springs by Legendary King Ravana. And another attraction is the “lovers leap” or “Ravana Cleft” a 350ft vertical cleft. It is a sight worth burning your feet on the hot rock face. It's a busy temple and beautiful. I was amazed to see and learn about Hindu traditions and how people perform the ceremonies there. You can have a nice breathing view of the blue ocean and Trincomale beach. I had fruit juice there in a small shop. Unique religious place with a picturous backdrop. Nice view from the top. Better to visit during puja times. Unless you have VIP, the vehicle has to be parked far away. ARUNA KONDASINGHE Lovely location, good to see the sunset and sunrise from the top of the peak. It would be nice if the history was written in English as travelers would like to know about it There is something exhilarating about standing on the top of a rock and taking in a magnificent view. From this temple, which is as close to God as anyone can get here in Trincomalee, the views over the Indian Ocean are sublime. There are small shrines built into the cliff and it is lovely to stand with Hindu devotees as they perform their rituals. The temple, the people, and the wonderful view make this place a worthy place to visit. On our way down the hill, after collecting our shoes, we sat in a coconut cafe, high above the cliff, sipping coconut water whilst immersing ourselves with this unforgettable cultural experience. Nice to walk up the hill towards the temple and enjoy the view! Beautiful statues and impressive temple Very auspicious place for Hindus. Our main object was to take 5 shivlinga darshan that are famous in Sri Lanka. This is one of them. It should be a sunny day to go this place can see ancient sculpture all Hindu architecture. very colourful. Since its a temple should wear proper cloths. Good temple. Learned new stories about Ravana. The temple is very neat and clean and offers excellent views of Indian Ocean. Very religious place to see. It's a very nice place near to the town and its on a hill mountain. The entrance to this temple falls from. The fort gates and it is being surrounded with the army camp. Very safe and any vehicle can be taken very near to the temple. The lovers leap is also is here and many tourist visit here and you can see from the sea level as well as from top. The shiva linga is there and many worshippers come to worship. Stay in trinco and enjoy the surroundings. The temple is small but colourful to madness and there are representations of unusual deities. It's atmosphere is relaxed. There is a service at 11 am. Also visit the little cave facing the sea. Great picture spot. The merchants on the way sell excellent honey based candy by the weight. Take your pick.",4.4,400,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/16/f3/d1/3c/thirukoneswaram-or-the.jpg?w=700&h=400&s=1,0.0,30.5,5.5,1.25,17.5,45.25
Thudugala Ella waterfall,"Thudugala Ella waterfall. This Falls is located in the  Thudugala Estate in Thudugala village at Kalutara District, Sri Lanka. Once owned by a British national, a derelict bungalow still remains near the waterfall. There is a natural swimming pool which even kids can use. Tudugala Waterfall is located in the village of Tudugala in the Dodangoda village in the Western Province of the Kalutara District.To visit Tudugala Falls, one can easily take a tuk tuk or family vehicle . When you visit Tudugala Falls you have to go through a rubber plantation. The ruins of an old bungalow can also be seen as you continue along the small footpath.As we continue along that trail we can hear the sound of the waterfall well.This waterfall consists of two deep and shallow areas.During periods of heavy rainfall, a large mass of water flows through the falls.Actually this water is very clean and very cold.Bathing in the cool waters of the falls gives you an unforgettable experience. I think it's best to take your food and drink with you when you visit the falls. Because the number of shops and facilities around it is minimal.It is best to go at a less crowded time to have the most peaceful experience. During the holidays, a considerable number of people visit this place. If you want to have a good experience, be more careful about it. Nice and cool water fall. a Place to See different kind of small fishes from there. to swim and have a little crunk its is a good place. We hired a taxi with another couple to visit a few places nearby, including the waterfall. It is very nice and also popular with locals. It's free to climb up by the waterfall, but there is a dodgy bridge half way. Something to do if you want to visit the local area. This hidden gem of the west was known to me courtesy TripAdvisor (thank you). The falls are picturesque,  the water is so cool you could just live on it forever. The downside was that some people who had come for a dip were taking drinks which is unsafe for both themselves and killed the serenity of the moment in my opinion because we were with kids. San that, the falls are a go to and I'd be happy to visit it over and over again Sunbathing at Thudugala Ella Kaluthara, Sri Lanka. Better to hired TukTuk and visit Waterfall starting point. No peoples are used to travel to starting point. Kind of a hiding place. I have been visited last month with my friend. We drive our own TukTuk All the way from wadduwa. Took 30 minutes. You can see few small villages on the way to the Thudugala Ella Waterfall. As a local I enjoyed much. Thudugala Ella is nearest Waterfall to the sea level. It's very easy to climb Waterfall because now there not much water. It is safe and can see many things about Waterfall We went on a Tuesday from Kalutara hotels by tuk tuk (30 minutes and 1000 rupees each way) and found the place deserted. It is a bit of a scramble up the path climbing up next to the falls, but any able bodied person can make it. The more adventurous of our party ignored the path and climbed up the boulders in the river. They saw a snake sunbathing. The top pool is deep enough to swim in, with rounded boulders under the water, which is clean and so cool after the climb. The only fault is the rubbish left by some people; I guess it is never cared for by the locals / government. Well recommend though, as it was a day out without being hassled to buy stuff Thank you #Trip Adviser. This place is very ideal for a one day trip. 1 hour from Colombo, if you take the Highway. Can do a little hiking as well. And the area is green and pretty. People have littered the place as usual, which is very disappointing. There can be a little problem with Vehicle parking, so better go earlier. :) Couples can enjoy leisurely. Sri Lanka has hundreds of waterfalls and this is one to visit and enjoy in full flow. It is a bit of a walk from the car park but is is worth  visiting Visited here in conjunction with trip to Richmond castle. Not a bit area to swim in. Would be crowded if more than 10 people visited. Spectacular all the same It is one of the easier accessible waterfall for the people living close to Colombo. Clean water. You need to park your vehicle beside the main road and walk about 200 meters inside. You walk past a tea factory and an abandoned old building. Nice surrounding. Beware of leeches. They would crawl in an instant. Nice waterfall to have a bath. Weekends are usually crowded, specially during the noon. A nice little trip to fill an hour or two. Easy to get to in a 3 wheeler nice abandoned buildings on the way to the fall and the rubber trees. It's unfortunate that there was little stacks of rubbish on the way and some slippery spots so be careful but a cool spot to check out. Very nice stopover point enroute to Nuwara Elliya. Approach to the waterfall is a bit slippery and not recommended for small childrern! Great natural beauty of nature, can be reached without much hassle through a rubber plantation and small forest. So beautiful and existing highck upto the falls. Due rain the rock surfaces are very sliperry and extremely dangerous at some places. There are leeches and some visitors haver littered the area. Must visit 😉 The water level of this small waterfall recedes continuously due to activities carried around its sourcing areas. This is the closest waterfall to the sea in Sri Lanka. Visited and polluted by locals on weekends and holidays. We went to the waterfall on a weekday, which I would recommend because it is more quiet then. It takes +- 30 minutes to get to the location from Kalutara and 5 minutes to walk to the actual waterfalls. You can go by busses but we hired a tuktuk/threewheeler. The lower part is easily accesable and for the top it takes a slightly steeper climb for 5 minutes. Unfortunately there is a lot of garbage at the lower falls so I would go to the top ones. Quite a way off the beaten track but pretty once you get there. Was able to get in and cool off in the cooling water. My friend and I hired a tuk-tuk driver to take us there. It was approximately a twenty minute journey with pleasant scenery. The walk into the waterfall is short - five minutes but a bit of a scramble so I suggest wearing runners. Unfortunately there's quite a bit of rubbish along the way. The waterfall was lovely, even though it hadn't rained in the past week. Any one can go there with in few minutes from Kalutara city. The nearest waterfall to Kalutara city. We walked through the rubber plantation to get there and swam in the pools. After a visit to Richmond palace We visited whilst out and about, not rainy season so not as much water as normal, but still worth visiting as was great. Steps down are very steep and once you are down not much space but we had the place to ourselves so couldn't complain and got some nice pictures. You can go down and take a dip but we didn't bother as we had other things to see and do. I liked this place and you can enjoy bathing and natural waterfall for free in this palace. Enjoyed the trip on here This place is very easy to access. Only a 5 minutes walk from the vehicle park. Along the way you can see a old rubber factory building which is now closed. Water is clean and too much crowd in weekends and holidays. You can have a nice bath from both top and bottom of the fall. Some are sliding along the water fall. But I don't recommending it. Top of the waterfall there is a natural cave on the left side. We Tuk Tuk,ed from Mermaid Hotel to visit. On way we saw the vast Rubber Plantation and disused factory. We went on a Sunday, and it was quite busy with locals. They left us after 20 minutes in total peace to enjoy.  Great just lying in the water chillin ........ Told its best after rainfall. Watch out for Monkeys in trees as you leave.  They are about. A Kilometer or two along the road on right hand side. Great Fun. I went with  my  friends  by bike, it's  took  us about  half an hour  from Kalutara.  Nice small  and  quiet waterfall. We enjoyed  our  time  a  lot. Fresh water, lovely  sound of  water and  birds. Good  place to  relax. Nice place for spent over free time.. beautiful sound we were hearing here. Some people dropped plastics and inorganic items here. I would like to say to travelers keep cleanly this places. this is a great day out, we saw  4 blue whales it was fabulous, then went for lunch in Galle , Not too great, but on the way back to Kalutara  we called at a turtle hatchery, such a treat! if you visit Sri lanka you will find out that there is not much of the attractions there - but this one is worth to go to and take pictures We visited the waterfall last week as it was close to our hotel, about a 30 minute walk. No one at the hotel knew about the waterfall, which was surprising as it was one of a few in the area, with this being the biggest. It is tucked away behind an old rubber tree plantation house but in the middle of a rubber tree nursery with over 40,000 trees being grown. You walk down a small track and follow the noise of the water as there are no signs posted. As you get near the waterfall, you can hear the water running fast through the bushes and trees. Theres two parts, the lower part is pretty flat, but another 100m walk up the river reveals a secluded deeper waterfall where you can bathe in shallow water. Recommendation Dont go during holidays as the locals swamp the place, especially POYA day. Take lots of water as there are no jungle shops, and sun cream. great place to visit - true Sri Lanka away from the beach. Quite a steep walk but well worth it. not too much water right now so able to access closer. We visited couple of times. The Thudugala Ella waterfall is located in the Thudugala village in Dodangoda Divisional Secretariat in Kalutara District of Western Province, Sri Lanka. Out of around 382 recorded waterfalls in Sri Lanka, the rank of this is 268th.",4.4,51,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/45/b7/97/thudugala-ella.jpg?w=700&h=400&s=1,0.0,25.806451612903224,9.67741935483871,0.0,32.25806451612903,32.25806451612903
Udawalawe Dam,"Udawalawe Dam. A very beautiful place. This month, a beautiful mountain range is visible from afar, which is full of water. This place makes you feel very relaxed in the evening.. If you also visit Udawalawe, do not miss this place.... Sunrise and sunsets are picturesque when crossing this dam. You can watch brave fishermen at the water lock A place where the sky meets horizon. Endless blue waters and green trees add another level of beauty. The breeze coming from the reservoir adds calmness to my mind. In the morning cold mist take over makes it scenic. If you do the safari at udawalawe you will cross the dam and see the massive expanse of water and the run off spectacularly flowing over big boulders creating lots of white water Awesome scenic view both sides of the dam.Could spot animals for water in the evening.Best place for some great photo shots.Highly suggested spectacular drive through in Udawalwe. beauty full water tank surround by mountains. Beauty full view can see the eagles and  other fishing birds around that lake This dam is on the way to the entrance to the Udawalwa National Park.  It is impressively long with great views.  We even saw an elephant on an island near the dam! Scenic Drive! I drove along the 4-kilometer-long Uda Walawe dam on 26th November 2019, stopping at interesting locations to take photographs.  A two-lane road runs over the embankment of the dam, built across Walawe Ganga (river).  The 268 million cubic metres of water impounded by the dam provide irrigation facilities to 23600 hectares at both left and south banks of Walawe Ganga.  Two hydro-electric power plants installed at the head of the left and right bank canals generate 6 MW of electricity. The view across the dam is scenic, extending over to the distant hills beyond. The dam incorporates five spill gates on the left end. At the time of my visit, one of these was partially open with water gushing out over its spillway.  Visitors are not permitted to go downstream to watch this phenomenon as it is not considered safe. In addition to the gated spillway, the two power plants and the right and left bank canal outlets, there is a natural spillway, 366 metres long, built at the leftmost end of the dam to protect it against an unusually heavy flood.  The power station near the left bank power plant serves to connect the power plants into the national grid.  on that clear day when we drove over the dam, we enjoyed its large expanse of waters and the scenery extending up to the hills beyond.  We saw some waterfalls too in the distance. this is the longest dam in srilanka. it is 4 km length and it was built in more than 40 years ago. sometimes wild elephants comes close to the dam to eat some fruites from thepeople. Its a good place to spend sometime on the way to Udawalawe but not worth considering as a separate activity/ sightseeing location. We stopped for a while simply because it was on our way and we had time to spare. It was pleasant but no different from the surrounding places. It's very big and you'll see it on the road to Udawalawe . I can't imagine why anyone would wish to visit it. Freezing view with nature and elephants near main road. Eye catching colors. 4 km long drive start to end. As the area was experiencing a period of drought the entire area was open with lots of wild animals coming to the remaining water oh! so nice i like this butty in this place when the dam is opened they took me for the time when the dam is opened because of that i got the chance to feel that experience also Beautiful to see all the wildlife - especially in the early evening! Great place to watch the sun go down! Something to view for tourists to Udawalawe, this great collection of freshwater.   On the other side, the locals enjoy a bath in the flowing river among the rocks.   Popular with locals When entering to the Udawalawe park we are going through the dam. It's not a lot more impressive tourist attraction but if you are travelling in the evening this place gives you a scenic view with the lake. The air flow was heavy when driving through and some times you would be able to see elephants coming near to the nest. Udawalawa dam was constructed across the Walawe river to construct  Udawalawa reservoir. It is sutuated just 5 km from udawalawa junction towards Thanamalvila. The Thanamalvila B427 road runs along the dam. So this could be the most seen reservoir in Sri Lanka. Wow! The surrounding is always breathtaking and very dynamic. During dry season the water levels are very low due to lack of rain. On one side, there is deep bule waters of the reservoir with the mountainous backdrop and on the other side the low land is blanketed with evergreen lush greenery. In the evening you can easily spot some elephants in the reservoir. It is worth spend at least few minutes there. Wow what a place to be in the morning or evening as it is great place to see the surrounding area as the view is great. in the evening you can spot elephants whom come to drink and one was their near the road. The dam is a good viewing point over the Uda Walawe forest. One can see the sunset and even see elephants near the water's edge. There is one bull elephant that comes close to the road looking for treats from visitors To be seen as part of a wider visit to the National Park. Occasionally see and c elephant or two taking water. The reservoir was very low when we passed by. A staggeringly large reservoir if you are lucky elephants can be seen going down for drink from the main road We enjoyed senic views as we crossed the dam to visit the Udawalawe National Park. The water was at a unusally low level for the time of year due to lack of rain. We saw elephants around the water edge at a distance. Once you are on the road it's one of the most spectacular sceneries. Two types of landscapes can be noticed. When the dam is filled with water or when it is really dry The road takes you over the head of this large dam where you have great views of the national park from it's elevated position.  There is always an elephant by the fence, and cars frequently stop to take photographs. The water was very low when we travelled at the end of August We were there on our way to the National park. The dam is so high, you travel on it and you feel the strong breeze passing from one side of the dam to the other. Surrounding mountains far away adds a beautiful touch to the scenic view. On your drive from Colombo to visit the Udawalawe National Park you pass through this massive agricultural dam over the Walawe river.The Udawalawe tank forms one border of the park , providing water for the animals. If you are lucky you might see one elephant hanging around the electric fence along the dam which prevents them from foraging on the sugar cane fields across.Please DO NOT FEED THIS ELEPHANT. This is a very long dam! It is about 5 kilometers long. When you drive along or spend time on the dam, you would see the Udawalawe National Park with animals like deer and elephants. There is a famous elephant who use to visit the dam and expect food from people pass by; however, the authorities strongly discourage feeding this particular elephant (may be because of a recent incident with a drunk fool who almost got himself killed by the elephant by approaching in a very idiotic manner making the elephant nervous). The wind that flows above the dam is very strong; especially when you pass this place by a Safari jeep early  in the morning, it's a unique feeling which would only experience at this place. Compared to the other tourist attractions locations, this area consists of many honest people who wouldn't try to rip off visitors; rather we noticed that many people try to be satisfied with the good feedback they get in return for their honesty and good service. Therefore, I would recommend people to visit this place!",4.2,37,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/2b/c0/6e/right-bank-power-plant.jpg?w=700&h=400&s=1,0.0,39.285714285714285,10.714285714285714,0.0,10.714285714285714,39.285714285714285
Yatala Wehera,"Yatala Wehera. A large structure slightly neglected with elephant walls the Yatala Vehara a Buddhist stupa dating back to the 3rd Century B.C and seemingly ignored in a quiet spot in the town. No tourists, no entry fee. With another couple of large stupas in the town it is worth an hour or two in a tuk tuk visiting them. We were surprised that it was so unkempt. It had a load of artifacts which were of archeological value. Visit the mesuem by the side of the pagoda. Worth to visit, it's on your way to Kataragama. Recommended to visit there and to get a historical, religious  experiences. Right by the roadside for a handy stop. One of the lesser visited stupas. The elephant frieze here is in brick. Over 2 millenniums old. Worth a brief look in passing. A little less well maintained than many other Temples. We had a few hours to spare before our afternoon safari so we followed the main road to visit this site.  There is a small parking area in front. At first, we thought that the stupa was off limits to visitors because the small iron gate/fence was closed.  When we walked the small bridge over the lily pond to get closer to the eroded brick elephant wall, we noticed that the gate was unlocked so we stepped inside. The site could use a new coat of paint and maintenance.  It is easy to see that the statues and Buddhas were ancient but there was very little signage.  There were two small houses/structures to the left and right, outside the elephant wall but we did not know which was the museum so we did not wish to intrude. We saw several similar stupas that appeared much cleaner and nicer surrounded with colorful Buddhist flags.  This one stood out because it was surrounded by a small pond and eroded elephant wall. Beautiful, quite temple by roadside . Lot of people visiting Kataragama miss this place with a history running beyond two millennia . There is a museum also. Beautiful and serene construction. Requiring a bit of maintenance and a tidy up, but still worthwhile to pull-in at the side of the road for some time to view and take some photos. In the summer of 2018 we (Dutch familie of 4, kids 13 and 18) travelled to discover the beauties of Sri Lanka. We walked to this dagoba from our hotel en were charmed by the way it is surrounded by water with water lilies. The brick elephans were also beautiful, as were the ancient statues standing around the dagoba. In the dagoba there are some huge holes which showed the massiveness of the dagoba, but the reason for them we could not discover. At the right side is a small archeological museum, that may have given the answer, but our sons did not want to go to a museum... Very quaint Stupa surrounded by a lovely lily pond. It is painted in the usual brilliant white and catches the sun beautifully. It is right beside the lake which makes for a lovely walk. We were in Tissa for two days doing Yala Safaris. If you are doing likewise this stupa makes for a nice visit. If you are passing this temple en route to your destination, this is a good place to visit since a museum is also situated next to the temple, showcasing the history of Sir Lanka.. If you are staying in Tissa and have time to explore the town - e.g., before / after  a Safari, this is nice to visit and you can easily walk from the Tissa main road This dagoba here is smaller than the main one to the east, but it's quaint in its own way, as it's surrounded by a moat with lotus leaves. It also offers more tranquility, as it's not as crowded. Very peaceful, people seem to forget leave this pagoda out. There is a small museum to the side that has pieces dating back to 2BC. The place is quiet big and very neatly maintained. I liked the Pure white color be it the temple exterior or the white clothes of the locals and even the hotel linen and bathrooms are sparkling white. Its really amazing I live in Sri lanka and have never even heard of this temple let alone visited. This time traveling to kataragama did some research ad this temple was on my iteniary. I was very very impressed. Dating more than 2500 years. Supposed to have been built by king mahanaaga to give thanks for the birth of his son yatala tissa ad also for escaping an assassination attempt. These is a small museum which is full of ancient artifacts including the face of lord buddha made of moonstones and an ancient toilet used by the priests. The staff of the museum very knowledgeable ad went out of their way to explain the history of the temple ad the artifacts. The temple itself is surrounded by a moat.. Beautiful ad peaceful environment. Fascinating place right next to the main road from Debarawewa to Tissa. Huge dagoba apparently filled with earth with some interesting carvings on the perimeter walls. Nice setting with water around. Ancient and interesting. This place is a 'must' for anyone travelling in the Tissamaharama area and interested in the history of Buddhism. It is a huge stupa believed to have been built some 2,300 years ago. It is surrounded by a fascinating wall with sculpures of details of elephant heads and you can also see a traditional moonstone. The whole place is tranquil and exudes a sense of calm. We accidentally took de tour and came across this dageba. It was really a beautiful area. not a popular place, but a must visit. Very interesting museum with a very knowledgeable curator who spoke English and could tell about the various artifacts stored there. This is a historical Wehera and need to be taken care by the authorities. Visited in the night and there were not enough lights to lit up. Yatala Dagoba It is the same with this Dagoba, I saw this Dagoba and I had to see it. I walked from town 20 minutes to check it out. It was listed in my guide book & I LOVE Buddhist temples for their serenity so I must go, eh? good regigious place with nice history. Ruins very well visible and nice renovation of the main stupa in its classic form. strange to see this building surrounded by a beautiful pond with its stunning flowers. The most striking thing about this pagoda it its surrounded by a moat most probably for protection. And this is a very calm temple. Also don't forget to visit the small museum there. This Tempel is incredible, very old and just so beautiful. I totally fell in love with this over 2000 year old structure. There are very interesting statutes all around the temple and it has elephant faces all around the outside wall along the pond. Also do go and see the museum where you will see incredible very old Buddha statutes and Buddha head made of moonstone. Must not be missed Good Place to visit with a lake nearby. It is a holy religious place and should be respected. A bird sanctuary is close to this place. The ancient dagoba of Yatala Wehera is situated on the main road to Tissa. The dagoba itself has mainly historical value (said to be over 2000 years old) but is nicely situated among lotus ponds. Just outside the dagoba is a small museum building, which has ancient statues (including a Buddha head made of moonstone) and an ancient bidet. When we arrived the museum was not open, but the caretakers rushed of on bike to get the key - and gave us an insightful tour. This Pagoda is the oldest in this area of Tissa. Just along the roadside so very easy to access. Surrounding Lotus pond adds a senic beauty to the location. This is a really old pagoda which has a moat around it. There are stalks and birds in the water and it's quite beautiful if it wasn't for all the rubbish floating in the water and on the land. It's definately worth a stop if you're en route but personally I would do a special trip for it just yet. Historical temple....by the main road.......quick stop......go to Yala or Kataragama......not crowded......talk to the priests.......ask the history of the temple! Take a photo with them!",4.2,36,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/6a/9f/bf/getlstd-property-photo.jpg?w=700&h=400&s=1,0.0,27.58620689655172,6.896551724137931,0.0,17.24137931034483,48.27586206896552
