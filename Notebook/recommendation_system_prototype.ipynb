            "abayagiriya stupa abayagiriya stupa when i visited this place there were no crowds at all and looks abandoned in it s past glory it was built in 3rd century by mahasena the dagoba was considered as third tallest monument in the world first two are pyramids from egypt beware of monkeys that were waiting to snatch any bags of eatables from careless visitors behind the dagoba there are ruins of monastery that once housed thousands of buddhist monks since we were staying three days near dambulla we decided to visit anuradhapura since it was a world heritage site frankly compared to polonowarra there is not that much interesting to see here to justify such high entrance price the large stuba and renovated baths are interesting but after that you have to travel large distances to see things that in my ignorance were not that interesting on the other hand you do not need to pay the entrance fee if you just want to visit the lovely buddist temple and the tree of knowledge this is the most incredible structure one can only gaze in awe and wonder how on earth did they manage to construct it also a peaceful place i guess we were there in the off season to wander around without getting hassled by anyone the jetavanaramaya is a stupa located in the ruins of jetavana in the sacred world heritage city of anuradhapura sri lanka mahasena of anuradhapura 273 301 initiated the construction of the stupa following the destruction of the mahavihara his son maghavanna i completed the construction of the stupa it is also significant in recorded history as one of the tallest structures in the ancient world and the second tallest non pyramidal buildings after pharos lighthouse of alexandria the height of the stupa is 400 feet making it the tallest stupa in the ancient world the structure is no longer the tallest but it is still the largest with a base area of 2 508 000 sq ft approximately 93 3 million baked bricks were used in its construction its not very popular as some other stupas in the area still very impressive and a must see sight if you are at that area it is a religious sight and you have to walk bear foot one look at this imposing structure and an overwhelming feeling envelopes you this is a must visit place a human marvel when you stand next to it 400ft you will realise how big it really is when it was originaly built it was the 3rd tallest monument in the world next to the pyramids of egypt it is supposedly the tallest brick structure in the world 93 3 million bricks have been used definitely worth a visit kids had fun trying to figure out how tall it was by standing next to it this is the largest stupa in the world this is preserved in the stage it was founded hence the top of the stupa is broken this is a religious place for buddhists however this is also a place where you and admire and learn about the ancient technology architecture art and buddhist culture somewhat ignored by most pilgrims yet this is the most impressive of the stupas in the historic city and one of the 8 sacred sites without much ado the focus here is clearly on the stupa highest brick stupa ever built the bo tree and the buddha image a tour towards the end of the day will give you fantastic light for your walk around makes for superb photo shots the remains of the adjacent monastery are impressive both in size as well as functionality do not miss this stupa on your tour i was taken on a great tour of all the free sites and the isuruminiya 200 rupees before visiting three main stupas for which you had to pay 3750 rupees 25 by the time i had finished the free sites it was approaching noon and i don t think it was worth paying 25 to see the last three the moon stone and tank but that s only my opinion jetvana was empty at 1pm it was very impressive in its size and i liked the exposed bricks as opposed to the white stucco surfaces on most of the stupas i visited definitely wear socks as the pavement and sand is very hot this is a must see amongst all the attractions inside the ancient city admire the building work and the longevity of the stupa many people come here to pay their respects so be sure to dress appropriately if you are lucky you will see groups of people walking around with yellow clothes they donated to the temple and supplies to the monks we had a great guide who told us a lot about sri lankan history and the meaning of the stupa a great place to visit if you re in anuradhapura we visited this area and saw this magnificent stupa when touring sri lanka it was a recommended visit by our guide who took us to some amazing areas we took some great photos as the area wasn t too busy as it was the low season i imagine it could get very busy and hot during the peak season there were some people selling items but they were not a nuisance this is one of the biggest ancient stupa another sacred archaeological site in anuradhapura sri lanka by the time of my visit it was under some renovation reconstruction process but it was still holding its former glamour well preserving the sacred values of its past go with a guide to get the full history if this ancient place once the third highest building in the world after the pyramids this was our first stop visiting the anuradhapura ancient site which is the unesco world heritage site entrance fee for the entire site is lkr4 550 or usd25 per person per entry it is the significant structure as biggest and tallest building in the ancient world of anuradhapura kingdom in 3rd 4th century best way to visit the site is by hiring a driver since the site is huge and scattered and not within walking distance we engaged our driver service with blue haven tours with fantastic and dedicated driver dress appropriately with cover shoulder and pants dress below knee if possible wear socks as walking on the sandstone under the daylight can be burning for the feet drinking water is essential too nice start to explore the anuradhapura ancient site unfortunately the museum was closed for renovations during our visit otherwise it would be informative prior to visiting to the sites we visited this beautiful old stupa as part of a full visit to the old town of anuradhapura there was a gentlemen there who explained us a bit about the stupa the full visit is really recommended but you have to get a bike or do it by car tuktuk which is way less fun if you do the tour by yourself better to have google maps with you as a lot of things are hidden we visited jethawanaramaya stupa in the evening the lighting was really great and the calmness is at its best its not very popular as some other stupas in the area on that day we were the only people there and the brick work is quite beautiful with the lights ok so it s the largest stupak with many millions of bricks but apart from walking around the outside that s it again whole anuradhapura sri lanka trip gave us very pleasant feeling nice place to explore and also to spend days in a great historical site i do not suggest a driver i prefer solo try not to engage the locals the tuk tuk driver tried to get me to pay 2000 rupees for the day i enjoyed the pictures and the hike and the history as i learned in nepal and kenya always barter and start real small it is the greatest place of buddhists abhayagiri vihāra was a major monastery site of theravada mahayana and vajrayana buddhism that was situated in anuradhapura all old anuradhapura are in ruins if you are budhist go and see them if you are an archeologist go and see them if you are a simple turist go to polonnaruwa or better to sigiriya or dambulla too much ruins but the old main stupa is beautifull maybe not for 25 dollars the new stupa is olso nice finally 2 stupas against lot of ruins average this was the first site in anuradhapura that we were taken to by our driver guide and we were very impressed to think that this building pre dates christianity puts it to my mind alongside the pyramids in egypt ok there is not a great deal to do here except wander round but it is truly amazing additionally we were treated to the company of several coachloads of sri lankan children visiting at the same time as us they were delightful and seemed to be fascinated by our fair skins and hair our driver suspected that they had come from remote village schools and not familiar with westerners and wanted to be photographed with us this was a worthwhile visit for us i would also like to put an alternative viewpoint to those posters who complain about the cost of entry to anuradapura the cost at around 3500 rupees is under uk 20 less than you would pay for a decent evening meal and this is for the whole city site which i doubt could be visited in full in one whole day it is an historic site of world importance which housed an amazingly sophisticated civilisation pre dating the birth of christ that it is not better known is surprising as for the fact that locals pay a lesser entry fee and this applies to sites throughout sri lanka and in some shops and restaurants too i grant that this is an unusual arrangement but i personally do not begrudge them we westerners have probably spent more on our trip than the average sri lankan earns in a year third world country residents need all the help they can in improving their lot incredibly we were the only ones there when we visited something like 93 million bricks were used in its construction very impressive and a must see if in the area this was our first stop using our anuradhapura cultural ticket and we really enjoyed exploring jetavanaramaya dagoba walking through the grounds before we reached the dagoba we came across a number of different birds including egrets grey hornbills flycatchers and bee eaters which was lovely the dagoba itself is huge it s lost some height so must have been really impressive back in its day walking around the base is a must but be minded to wear socks the floor is hot and a bit gritty and my husband even managed to stand on broken glass so barefoot is not ideal there s a brightly painted reclining buddha here too take time to explore the grounds as they are a pleasant place to get lost we didn t spend long at all in the museum just walked around the 3 different rooms rather quickly lots of decent bike parking if you are cycling the temples this is one of the greatest attractions of the ancient sacred city of anuradhapura and is a must to see one of the many wonderful things about the anuradhapura experience is the immense variety of structures to be seen and this huge building of jethawanaramaya is very different from others because of its construction from brick it is quite amazing how the brickwork was done if one purchases a ticket for the main attractions of anuradhapura this stupa is included in the price as with all of the sacred places shoes must be removed before entering and appropriate clothing worn one of a largest and oldest stupa in srilanka it will take around 5 minutes to go around it you should definitely visit this place if you visiting the sacred anuradhapura city this stupa might be nice in case you haven t visited myanmar but after visiting myanmar with all the great stupas this one is below average a good to see place if you have time we went when it was getting dark couldn t take many pics but it has a lot of history during 3rd cen bc jetawanaramaya had been the the world s third tallest building in the world it has now been discovered that the stupa is built on a square shaped brick structure which is 26 m below ground level truly a marvelous structure can t enter this temple but can walk right around the perimeter very large so remember to wear a sun hat or carry an umbrella as there is no shelter from sun this review is about jetavanarama stupa anuradhapura sri lanka this review is not about abhayagiriya stupa anuradhapura which looks similar there are a number of ancient buddhist stupas in the holy city of anuradhapura built around 300 ad the jetavanarama stupa was about 400 ft high in the earlier times in was also one of the seven wonders of the ancient old due perhaps disputes between various sects of buddhist religious orders in the ancient times the stupa was levelled up and then reconstructed to its present height of about 300 ft a place is calm and the atmosphere is peaceful there is also buddhist shrine inside the campus with many entrances exits i got lost and had to circle the outer ring road a few times before my car driver guide located me it is suggested that suitable sign boards direction boards could be placed at the entrances for the foreigners who are not familiar with the stupa recommended this temple was fascinating at the time of our visit it was under renovations with age the temple is collapsing the workmen doing the work have no safety gear and it was extraordinary to watch the climb the side of the temple like it was a normal flight of stairs i with my daughter hashi visited one the most sacred places for sri lankan buddhists the jetavanaramaya stupa that built during 273 301 by the king mahasena it is believed that a part of the belt used by the buddha is enshrined in the stupa this is situated within the mahamewuna uyana garden in anuradhapura city that also announced as a sacred world heritage city where the sacred sri maha bodhi and ruwanweli maha seya stupa also situated this stupa rising up 400 feet 122 m to the sky that making it the tallest and largest stupa in the world the area covered with stupa is about 233 000 sq feet and built with baked bricks with unique size and identified as a wonderful engineering construction that highlight the significant development prevailed in the history of the sri lanka if you visited the place early in the morning or evening you can get a better feeling as a mild winds heal the heat and gives you feeling calm pleasure you have to remove shoes and hats when enter the stupa area and must wear cloth that covered your shoulders and legs below the knee this is just like any other buddhist stupa only probably huger than the rest the entrance fee is too high lkr 3250 per person saarc nations get it at half that price but it is still expensive when you buy the ticket you get entrace to about 7 8 religious places but all are alike there are either brick stupas or white ones the same kind of ponds with garbage strewn in the sides the guardian stone and the moonstone also aren t anything great you need to remove your footwear to visit these temples i don t have a problem with that it is religious the only problem was the stone heats up too quickly and it was like walking on burning coal something needs to be done for this by the end of the tour we were less interested in seeing the monuments and more interested in finding shade for our feet the museum has random pieces of pottery jewellery and statues some are from india and other countries all in all i did not find it worth the price of the entrance ticket and if you are from india it is not too different from the local ruins we find in hampi halebeedu etc jethawana stupa is huge its huge from along way away and its even bigger as you get closer you can see it from minihtale and everywhere in anuradhapura its 80 m high and 220 m wide you cant miss it and you will be drawn to it its so impressive its a statement about the power of the religion which built it i prefer to view it in the morning it was just ok walked around the stupa nice wall to sit on surrounding the grounds did not really enjoy this stop this is a must see in anuradhapura as part of a larger world heritage site it is a huge buddha in the nirvana position the colours of the buddha and the murals are fantastic despite its age it is very spiritual nice beautiful place to visit avoid day time because of the heat try to find someone who can explain the history of the place the sheer scale of it cannot be captured in a photo if you are travelling here i highly recommend hiring a guide to explain the significance of it as the information they provide gives the experience a new level of depth allowing you to appreciate the site even more this stupa is believed to contain a sacred bowl which lord buddha is believed to have ate from the bowl is believed to be buried almost 200 feet deep this stupa has been restored but without rendering the outside walls as was the norm in this period because of that you can see more of how it was built and all the brickwork this was the first statue of the resting buddha we saw another guide told us it was the dying buddha who knows this dagoba was the first stop on our 4 hour tuk tuk tour of the sites and very impressive the sheer scale is breathtaking i was surprised to see the tranquil beauty of this place in the night it is almost heaven i believe when less or no crowd good to visit if you are devout buddhist not being a buddhist nor of religious bent of mind and the stupa not being of particular architectural interest i could easily have given it a miss a great monument built by the ancient kings it looks as it was not fully completed archaeology department has done a good job in restoration another very famous historical site in anurahapura and the jethawanarama stupa was built by king mahasena in the anuradhapura history the stupa is built out of rock and is very tall well worth a visit it s so impressive to see such a huge stupa at this site the archaeological site excavations are quite extensive and well maintained the museum hare has extensive collection from the earliest times this was build almost 2 000 years ago and was one of the tallest buildings in the world at that time most of the stupas in the area are white so this one stands out nice place to take a photo but don t fly a drone here they are very strict about this and could even arrest you one of the highly valued historical and religious landmarks located within the ruins of the sacred city of anuradhapura a part of a sash or belt tied by the buddha is believed to be the relic that is enshrined here this is also significant in recorded history as one of the tallest structures in the ancient world it is 400 ft in height the ancient kings have used over two million bricks to build this and it still stands perfect with sun and rain must visit place you should go by car around these places of interest otherwise you will waste lot of time walking from one place to the other this was my favourite of all the dagoba s we visited in anuradhapura just huge incredible and awe inspiring and still one of the largest tallest brick built structures from the ancient world the stupas at anuradhapura are mind blowing jethawanaramaya stupa is massive and you keep wondering how they built these huge structures during those times jethawanaramaya is one of the biggest stupas in sri lanka although it is still not fully restored its massive structure is a landmark in anuradapura it is said that this is in align with one of the stars of the orion there is more of this complex uncovered with the ongoing excavations one of the great massive stupas around anuradhapura although with little to see up close it also has a small museum nearby located nearby ruwanweliseya this massive stupa is less crowded and perfect for peace loving travellers visit in the early morning a really beautiful monument to visit it is possible to see several of the surrounding monuments all in one day as with many places in sri lanka the floor is awfully hot underfoot and travelling with sandals i found out the hard way that site seeing was hard when i forgot to pack spare socks leaving your shoes outside the monument will incur a small charge if you are a tourist abayagiriya in wold unisco protect templs areya king walagamba made in this one sri lanka seconds place bigast brown clour beautiful sthupa very famouse place in anuradhapura every buddhist people should visit this place ancient place very close to the city i visited so many times also with my family so many tourists are coming to worship this place there are is a famous story about this stupa when you visit this place it requires pure respect the place is visited by the locals and i can see how much they take care of this place for foreigners like me it is an amazing place to see not to miss a visit to see the jetawanaramaya stupa is a must if you visit anuradhapura it is the biggest stupa in sri lanka and its quite unique from the other stupa s since it is still in its original brick form not plastered in white very fine stupa nice ambiance around it visited late afternoon which was a good time for the light for photos traveling in sri lanka you can get a bit stupa d out what added to the magic was the black faced monkeys so much friendlier and cuter then the white faced ones climbing and running around the stupa it is dry season so was very hot take a lot of water with you jethawana stupa was built by king mahasen it is the tallest stupa in the country but today because of nature you can t see the upper part of it there is a nice story behind how it comes to built earlier in king mahasen s time there was two clans of buddhist monks namely therawada and mahayana there were constant fights with this two clans unfortunately king got the side of mahayana clan and treated therawada monks very badly some times very brutally so after some time the therawada monks fleed in to deep forest with there books after several years passed by king realised that he had done a sin so he called back therawada monks to city again and correct his wrong decision but he still feel like uneasy after that with a discussion about the buddhism with the chief monk of therawada clan he build this huge stupa our tour guide said there was no need to go around the place so instead he just drove us closest possible to the area since we had seen quite a bit of stupa they all looked the same tallest sthoopa in sri lanka to me this is the most attractive and artistic sthoopa in sri lanka its looks magficient at night with lights on so don t miss visiting this place after sun set 7 8pm would be ideal a brick stupa that was the tallest in the world at its construction a real buddhist reliquary work and the tour continues with a reclining buddha and beautiful frescoes a beautiful walk in the park with some remains attention merchant the entrance displayed only for tourists at 30 per person 15 is then offered and parking is free a man tries to get you a few pennies amazing to think this statue once stood upright spectacular ceiling and wall decorations not to be missed it was amazing to stand in front of this stupa so big so white i walked around it as you should do when you come from afar but better bring some socks as you have to remove your shoes and the stones on a sunny day can be very very hot there s ruins seem to share a theme with others in other parts do the world ie canbodia where indian themes are present this stuppa dates back to the 1st century and is comprised of 93 million bricks wow the sheer size and the whole area around left me awe inspired this is also a great stupa with ancient carvings scattered around the premises keep in mind you need to remove shoes so the best times to visit are early morning or late evening this stupa treasure chamber with its budha statue in a dead position according to the position of the feet is another example of a magnificent building in anuradhapura king mahasena initiated the construction of the stupa following the destruction of the mahavihara his son maghavanna i completed the construction of the stupa it is significant in recorded history as one of the tallest structures in the ancient world and the second tallest non pyramidal buildings after pharos lighthouse of alexandria the height of the stupa is 400 feet 122 m making it the tallest stupa in the ancient world if you are coming from anuradhapura railway station you can have a 20 mins walk there to arrive there the distance will be around 1km you will pass several other temples also on the way make sure you are not wearing exposing or too tight cloths since it is a buddhist temple also make sure you not turning your back to temple when you are taking pics whilst some seem to be unimpressed it is amazing to think of the effort that went into constructing this building which is large but nevertheless very beautiful i agree that sensible folk might enjoy their tour of the sacred city more in the early part of the day to avoid the heat and crowds allows time just to enjoy being there without hiding from the sun or having the ales of your feet burnt this is one stop that all who visit anuradhapura will want to make this stupa is one that you can go inside in all the years i have been visiting this stupa has had a scaffolding on it being repaired but despite this fact it is worth the visit and especially inside with the temple and the recognition of the king of the time to commissioned its build this stupa is one to visit on a cloudy day as the surface can get too hot to walk on otherwise take a pair of socks this was suppose to be the tallest stupa when it as built huge area surrounding the stupa and the red brick outer covering is very beautiful this is worth seeing on your trip around the sacred lands this is enormous i was told that there are an estimated 93 million bricks used for this relic as it is solid inside the shear quantity is impossible to fathom and still makes me think now the grounds themselves are very large and every angle keeps showing you the scale of this one of the biggest stupas better to have a guide to explain all the historic views nice to walk around also nice stupa the only thing you can do during a visit of a stupa is walking around it anuradhapura it self is nice but all the sights are so scattered that you never have the idea that you are visiting an ancient city the local people are also living in between the ancient stupas and other sights you can t blame them but it is a pity of the total experience we liked other big sights as sigiriya and polonnaruwa more mainly because of this this is the tallest and largest of the stupas in anuradhapura originally it was 400fy high it is a world heritage monument it has a long history with the first sinhala buddhist king who built the stupa he dedicated to a monk named tissa who lived in a local temple jetavana is the stupa of this monastery it will s huge to walk around and admire the architecture and engineering even if one is not a buddhist enshrined in the stupa are relics that some believe belong to lord buddha himself really enjoyed visiting jethawanaramaya stupa everyone was so polite and informative we were there for about 60 minutes and that was enough time before moving on to the next temple the addmission was about 200lkr this was built in the 3rd century and is quite large it has several small temples around it that contain various gods nice stop on the trip this stupa left the strongest impression hidden by forest overgrowth and abandoned for centuries the plants enveloping it have been cut away and what you see is what was left rustic in appearance and only slightly restored this stupa also has a small shrine to the buddha with a large reclining buddha statue with offerings laid before it it has a curious authenticity and you can best view what these stupas are made of millions of handmade bricks this was once the largest brick structure in the world jetawanarama monastery complex requires one full day for a complete exploration because at each and every partially restored space we need time to pause in order to try to visualize what the building would have been like in the total complex the museum adjoining the complex is also a must i found this stupa even more attractive than ruwanweliseya with its primal look and dimensions knowing that only pyramides can match with her this is one of mega construction to visit in sacred city anuradhapura you must not visit here during the afternoon as it is very difficult to walk around the stupa the best time to visit here is during the evening this is more than 120 m high bulling and 8 acuras cover the sthupa and this was build at the 3 c ad incredible piece of engineering and a very impressive sight well worth a look at this stupa as well as the other ones dotted around anuradhapura we were driven around by ranil from artlankatours com ranil gave us a whistle stop tour of the main attractions in the city and was very knowledgeable about all of them highly recommend him its really big which makes it impressive but lets say it its just a stupa there are couple stands on the right which sell refreshing coconuts the stupa is very tall when it was created it was the tallest structure after the great pyramids of giza while you re not able to enter the stupa you can walk around it worth visiting to experience its size once one of the tallest buildings in the world this is still an impressive sight i think the guide said it was and still maybe the largest brick building ever made certainly should be on your list if visiting anuradhapura the stupa is located in the southern part of the anuradhapura site it is original because it is not a traditional white stupa it is a brick one when it was built 3rd century it was the third tallest structure in the world after the pyramids in egypt the scale of this stupa does it it is amazing to just walk all around it and experience its vastness must visit and must walk around be careful of summers it gets very hot and the stone floor burns the feet as you cant wear footwear carry socks we did this at the end of our tour and loved it very serene and bright image of the sleeping buddha we were there and had visited the sacred city with jethawanaramaya stupa and the museum and the abhayagiri stupa with museum the museums were not really impressing because there is not much explained on the antiques and they were really small museums but i can recommend the gold fish park where you can have a really nice walk and it s free of any entrance fee next to the park is the big reservoir called tissa wewa worth visiting the place there are no entry charges the structure is very well maintained a historical monument the stupa and the area surrounding the stupa is so well maintained and clean the history of the place is fascinating this is the biggest stupa in the world in terms of area and an impressive feat of engineering the stupa has an attached museum which is above average and gives a lot of context about the visit to the stupa the area around the stupa has lots of archaeology so interesting also for the history buffs all i know is that i keep wondering what happened to the top of the stupa itself as out of the three giant stupas in anuradhapura it is the only one missing a chunk also out of the three stupas this one seemed to be the most tranquil and the least visited very few people there when i visited i say go and take a walk around there were also a lot of monkeys at this compound and they made for great entertainment an excellent example of a reclining buddha this is part of a large collection of stupas and palaces some dating back to 2nd century bc they are all interesting along with the old artefacts jetavanaramaya stupa located in the ruins of jetavana monastery in the world heritage city of anuradhapura sri lanka at 122 metres 400 ft it was the world s tallest stupa and the third tallest structure in the world2 when it was built by king mahasena of anuradhapura 273 301 calm and peaceful ancient complex try going on a evening when the sun is almost down you will love the calm and peaceful surrounding very relaxing very impressive stupa although it would need a good restoration to clean the stones from the green moss that envelops them however the reclining buddha located at the foot of the stupa inside a small temple and all the statues that surround it are very beautiful it is definitely worth a visit i preferred this to the ruwanwelisseya dagoba as it is far less crowded and appears a little forgotten compared to its rival but the greater proximity to the trees and the additional troops of monkeys drives a feeling of awe and exoticism to the stupa this is amplified further by the sheer size and worn exterior and with there being fewer visitors to distract you its somewhere you can take it all in and enjoy in your own time the place is not fully renovated yet this is the largest stupa in sri lanka the place is not attracting pilgrims like ruvanweli stupa therefore a quieter place it has an ambience that allows you to attain mental focus quickly this could depend on the individual sit without any pre conceived notion and start meditating there if you re a person doing meditation experience it for yourself nothing more to add it s a must see place and is so colourful i could spend hours just looking at the detail an old stupa that is part of anuradhapura s ancient city there are many sites to visit in this area and they all have an interesting history many of these sites are well preserved and its very clean this is located in the anuradhapura sacred city giving grand look to anuradhapura this is 400 feet high tallest buddhist brick monument in the world s history and constructed in 3rd century ad by king mahasen and later his son completed it they have used more than 90 million bricks to build this solidly covered stupa according to historical sources we believe that lord buddha s belt was enshrined here this was our third dagoba stupa of the day and if we are honest they were beginning to get repetitive however having paid an eye watering 3 500 sri lankan rupees each we were determined to see as much as possible in the day underwhelmed by the whole experience that is a amazing historical technologies of the anuradhapura kingdom in sri lanka i like to that construction style together with abhayagiri dagoba jethawanaramaya dagoba was one of the tallest monument of the ancient world the lying buddha is imposing and it is also very coloured just imagine that this stupa in its orignal height was probably the third largest building in the world after the pyramids when it was built in the 3rd century higher than it is today millions of bricks form a magic shape that seem to have been covered previously this stupa was started to build by king mahasena but this was a huge stupa so it took a long time to complete king s son king mahadewa finally complete the stupa situated inside the jethawana monastery governments main job is to rip the tourist off and even the officials behave this way arrogant and not customer oriented at all it is all about money here the price for tourist rp 3500 compared to almost nothing paid by locals you have to pay that to be able to access the entire area not worth the money my generous donation will help you preserve the heritage as stated on the ticket however should the locals be also interested to take a part after you pay the entrance fee almost nothing is in english you have to open google to get at least some information also you would expect at least basic english knowledge of the staff if you charge this entrance fee we had a disagreement with the staff i took as 15 mins to find someone who can speak basic english or at least clean up at the historical sites from all the garbage i can t really see here that the money is actually going in the heritage didn t buy it also to be honest there is not that much you can see for the money here unless you are really a big history fan or buddhist this building is very good and deserves its status however my lasting memory of the sacred city will be the filth and rubbish not to mention the scabby starving dogs if the city is so sacred why do the locals treat it so badly if you visit you ll see a spectacular stupa we were lucky to visit at a time around one of the largest buddhist festivals perahera so the place was teaming with buddhists dressed in white chanting praying and carrying an array of beautiful flowers as offerings to buddha it was a very peaceful and calming experience i love the originality of this place less crowded than ruwanwelisaya more peaceful beware of the hot floor as you are required to take of your shoe and if best your socks too another impressive dagaba this time with the bricks exposed it is located away from the main pilgrim site even so it attracts the masses at religious festivals the small museum displays the finds made from around this structure located at the stuppa this is a nice reclining buddha the whole entrance is surrounded by hindu scenes from the ramayana which of course ties it to sri lanka religious place a sthupa built by king mahasen a please with a historical value one of largest sthupa in sri lanka unbelievable place and for me the absolute highlight of wonderful anuradhapura this wonderful stupa dates from the 3rd century and what s most striking is that it is totally unplastered and is made up of 90 million red bricks you can see the massive domed structure towering above you as you approach through the leafy grounds it stands 70m high but was once 50m higher than that making it the third largest building in the world behind only two of the giza pyramids in egypt you ll have to take off your shoes and have knees and shoulders covered but socks are okay and necessary as the paving slabs can be red hot there is a nice temple at one end with ornate paintwork and a reclining buddha statue an absolute must see this is a old buddhist temple here to visit the temple is big the buddha statue is beautiful you need about an hour here this is the tallest brick structure in the world its amazing how such monuments were built with such great technology so many centuries ago similar to abhayagiri apparently bigger but didn t strike me as much but what it does have is a huge number of monkeys playing on the walls they keep back from humans but you can watch playing around for ages this pagoda suppose to be the world largest brick work if you take out all bricks you can make a 6 foot wall for 600km for me i find it hard to comprehend the age of the stupa quite amazing best seen early in the morning no heat no people just a few monkeys and a lot of bird life i think it would be difficult to walk around the stupa in the middle of the day as you have to remove your shoes and it would be hot on your feet a calm and peaceful place well worth the visit as always it s barefoot so avoid the midday sun early in the day would be best very impressive stupa rising above the flat plain just viewed from a outside to photograph since having to be respectful and remove shoes the surrounds looked far too gravelly one of many stupas to visit in the huge anuradhapura area other stupas were filled with people but this stupa was a bit off the beaten track and not as well restored so had only a few people but with wildlife just roaming around monkeys climbing over the stupa and the rich red brick of the stupa made for some nice shots this is an ancient temple the one that is reputed to be the largest brick built structure in the world using over 90 million individual bricks very impressive they compare this to the pyramids of giza as an ancient structure and having been there a few times i can understand why considering the work that would have taken place is comparable to egypt in fact if all the stupas in anuradhapura were together on an open plain like those in giza these might be as famous but dotted around the old city with lots of the famous green vegitation and trees of sri lanka it renders the comparison impossible as with most of anuradhapura signage was practically non existent with very little in the way of historical description at each monument 3250 bucks for visiting places in anuradhapura 1625 for asians too pricey for the so called attractions this is just a place of working for sri lankans there are so many dagobas and stupas in sri lanka that this doesn t feel special in any way just a place to visit since you re already here and paid for your hotel this dagoba was built in 3rd century by king mahasena it was the third largest structure in the world that time first and second being egyptian pyramids in addition that was the first ever largest brick structure built by man it has been estimated over 90 million bricks were used for the project enough bricks to build 3m high wall from london to edinburgh the original height estimated at 120 present day it is only 70m tall you will not wast your time visiting this place as this is only a single place in an ancient city very large structure gradually decaying ruins on the west side are nice to walk through and there is a small footbridge on the west side to enter from this entry is much more scenic and relaxing than passing the touts on the east entrance review of jethawanaramaya from a tour guide s perspective as a tour guide visiting jethawanaramaya in anuradhapura is always an awe inspiring experience for both my guests and myself this ancient stupa one of the largest in the world stands as a monumental reminder of sri lanka s rich buddhist heritage and the incredible engineering feats of the ancient sinhalese civilization historical significance jethawanaramaya was constructed by king mahasena in the 3rd century ad and its original height is said to have reached over 120 meters making it one of the tallest man made structures of its time it was built on the site where mahinda thera the monk who introduced buddhism to sri lanka resided when i share these details with visitors they often express surprise at how advanced the ancient sri lankan civilization was particularly in terms of construction and religious devotion architectural marvel the sheer scale of the stupa is what usually leaves visitors speechless built entirely of bricks it is said that over 93 million bricks were used to complete this towering structure the stupendous size of jethawanaramaya is not just a display of religious devotion but also a testament to the architectural brilliance of ancient sri lanka as i guide guests around the stupa i like to highlight the craftsmanship of the brickwork and the symmetry of the structure which are still well preserved despite being centuries old spiritual atmosphere beyond its architectural grandeur jethawanaramaya offers a peaceful and spiritual ambiance the site is often filled with pilgrims making offerings and chanting prayers which enhances the sacred atmosphere i always encourage my guests to take a moment to absorb the tranquility of the surroundings as it offers a deeper connection to the spiritual history of the place for many the quiet reflection at the base of the stupa becomes a cherished moment in their journey through sri lanka they say that you can build a three metres high wall from london to edinburgh with the bricks that were used to build this dagoba pretty impressive and could you please use some of the massive entree fees us 25 to anuradhapura historical site to clean up all the litter would show as much respect for these holu sites as taking of your shoes the whole anuradhapura area is a sight we got bikes and went around to look at everything all the stupas and it was gorgeous we did t even get that 25 usd ticket you can get so close to the stupas and even walk through the ruins it was enough for us it feels a little like tomb raiding a mystical place with lots of monkeys running around we even got to see a varan near the jethawana stupa amazing that this massive apparently younger structure is so old and the brickwork is really impressive this is not only the worlds biggest stupa but probably the worlds largest brick structure stop off whilst visiting the world heritage site of anuradhapura which is a huge complex and you probably need a few days to see it properly has an interesting small temple attached you don t need long here but a must visit great place to see oldest vihara of 1st century worth visiting structure is entact and appealing this stupa is a huge structure in the world and a must visit if you are in anuradhapura so can see how small the bricks are jethawanaramaya is one of the other biggeststupa in anuradhapura there are more as this stupa but actually every of them is interesting and when you went there you hardly leave from there it feels strange and spirutual you can visit evey month of the year we have visited on august because of pera hera festival cheers ernur this stupa in anuradhapura area is huge you need to remove shoes to enter the temple but the artwork inside is fantastic fees were paid at the museum by our travel guide you need your pass to travel around anuradhapura be warned it is a vast area and the museum is the only place where you get the pass so visit museum first in anuradapura affter enter world heritage site you can see this amizing very big budist sthupa or dagoba row mateerial is millions of briks affter visite anuradapura dont miss this site jetawanaramaya is a temple complex during anuradhapura kingdom the jethawanarama stupa is the main dagoba of the jethawana complex the shape of the stupa is now slightly out of the original shape the top of the stupa is not completed since it is a world heritage it cannot be completed if completed this would have been the tallest stupa in sri lanka but now it s ruwanweliseya the structure is gigantic it s really difficult to walk in the morning and noon due to heat but in the evening it s a nice and calm place not much crowded even during weekends and poya days pilgrims come less to here because it has a less importance as a religious place don t forget to visit the surrounding places and the jethawana museum this was our first and best of the day it is massive structure which dwarfs you the closer you get the kids enjoyed walking around jethawana stupa is the largest stupa in the sri lanka built around yr 300 was originally 400 feet 122 meters in height and was the third tallest building in the world at that time of course it suffered during wars and invasions but was rebuilt we were said that today as a brick monument jethawanaramaya still remains the tallest of its kind in the world what is worth is visiting the room with coulourful bouddha sculpture the building itself impressive but it looks very nice in the evening when lights make it look like a fire amongst trees large red brick stupa it is really impressive in its scale it helps to wear socks as walking up to the site on the very hot stones and sand pathways can be very difficult in bare feet a guide is a must no shoes or hats cover knees and shoulders go in the morning to avoid the extreme heat plenty of facts and information at such a small site take socks to protect your feet when it s hot as you re not allowed to wear shoes wear full length trousers or skirts one of the very important monument of the sri lankan early kingdoms and buddhism history don t miss it don t forget hat and shoes forbidden inside the sacred area you will need sun protection cream and exchange socks is very practical the reason not just the dirty floor these places wasn t really dirty very often the stone very hot without shoes i recommend you before the visit you must read some historical fact about this place will be interesting the visit this stupa was built by king valagamba nothing is known about the ancient form of the stupa and later it was renovated the ruins show that there are rows of stone pillars and it is no doubt that there has been a house built encircling the stupa cover it the round courtyard of the stupa is 10 feet above the ground the diameter of the stupa is 45 feet and the diameter of the courtyard 1319 feet this is one of the key stupa s that is aligned with the orion belt it is second biggest structure in world next to biggest pyramid in giza read the review of ruwanweliseya my explanation is there about the all three stupa s that is aligned with the orion belt all stupas does have a crystal fix on the top of the cone crystals were use to reflect the beams what is coming from the orion belt to the respective places for the communication purposes in sri lanka there were records of information that there have been highly intellectual set of people living in sinhala island now sri lanka where they had very close links with extra terrestrials most of the unbelievable constructions were carried out with the help of the extra terrestrials this has a truth hence still you will discover certain types of lights sources does fly over mahiyangana are of sri lanka still there may be people who do have connections with extra terrestrials which we have not discovered with the modern science its huge as far as i could tell it is the main sight of this section of ancient ruins in anuradhapura as always there is an area where everyone leaves their shoes having said that it s not that impressive if you ve seen this kind of thing in myanmar and thailand if you haven t it s worth a look we arrived at late afternoon a timing when it was uncrowded and definitely cooler dusk spectacular the scale and the size of this stupa is really impressive it is wonderful to look at and admire it helps to wear socks as walking up to the site on the very hot stones and sand pathways can be very difficult in bare feet this stupa is close to the archeological museum which in closed for reconstruction therefore there was nobody there when we visited the stupa really an experience especially with a big her of monkeys climbing the stupa the stupa is well decorated it is a large stunning sacred place you simply can t miss it one of the best places in anuradhapura sites this is the most impressive place in anuradhapura i would place it on top with mihintale in places to see in anuradhapura the stupa is the largest in the world and overwhelms you with its size and symmetry if you want to walk around the stupa please choose early morning or wear socks the stone floor gets quite hot for bare feet jethawanaramaya is the largest stupa in the area and probably the largest in sri lanka itself our guide mentioned that this is the largest brick structure in the world irrespective of the superlatives this is a magnificent structure the size does impress you there is a very long history around this stupa the stupa was built by king mahasena 3rd century ad and was renovated and developed by successive kings at the time of king parakaramabahu the great 10th century the stupa was around 120mtrs high currently the stupa stands at 73 mtrs till the broken spire we visited in the morning time and there were hardly any one at the stupa there wasn t any one to check the tickets too the ruins are very impressive and compare favorably with other southeast asia destinations a day well spent strongly recommend this sacred sight the best option is to hire a tuk tuk driver with knowledge of the area to drive you around start early to avoid the heat and possible afternoon rain there is so much to see and experience just wander around the ruins and cast yourself back 2000 years and imagine the monks living in this beautiful place the peace and tranquility is tangible and inspiring the park like surroundings with these spiritual ruins is well worth the high entrance fee 25 don t rush enjoy this is a big site containing big stupas with a big entrance fee of 25 i also was expected to tip the official guide another 5 thus i think a total entrance fee of 30 is extortionate the guide walked me to the first building complex then drove to the next where we wandered through the trees viewing the ruins as he explained their significance we then drove to visit a few of the large stupas situated around the site as it was a buddhist holiday here were large crowds thus only took photos from the outside of the buildings i spent about 2 hours here and sure you could spent much longer but it was too hot and humid for me to stay any longer worth visitinf despite the entrance fee this dagoba is the largest in sri lanka it was under renovation for a very long time most of it is over the dagoba looks nice although only the bricks are there this temple is full of history so a guide or guide book is necessary if you are interested in the history as language is a problem be appropriately dressed as a mark of respect to buddhism even if its very hot the best time to visit is early morning till about 12 pm evening after about 4 p m we are traveling by rented tuktuk and had read that we could drive ourselves to the different sites after purchasing our ticket we did not hire a guide as we had read extensively and had a map however the map provided by the ticket counter wasn t entirely accurate and so it was a little tricky to figure out where exactly things were as they are quite spread out allow yourself a full day perhaps find a good guide dress appropriately for temple visits we did not know that white dress is recommended for viewing the ancient bodhisattva tree but luckily covered my black shirt with a sarong i d brought and bring water there are some good food stalls next to the moonstone site that sell cold coconuts for water and make excellent veggie and coconut roti highly recommend this too an excellent day spent this is a biggest stucture of ancient sri lanka should worship as a buddhist and also as a visiter you can get a knowledge about ancient sri lanka the area is nice no doubt about it but entrance fee is insane 3250 rupees each and after seeing three sights they started to feel the same that price does not include a map or any information about the area so we had no idea what we were looking at until we went home and googled it hired a tuk tuk driver to take us around he was friendly and helpful but it added another 1500 rupees to our bill by the end of the day also my wife was hassled at the entrance of two stupas because the back of her neck was showing in her modest dress this infuriated her because local women were obviously showing far more skin and left alone we are seasoned travelers that understand the dress code in religious places but being blonde seemed to be innapropriate here my wife was almost reduced to tears overall this expensive and uncomfortable day was not enjoyable for us maybe history buffs would get more out of it then we did though we preferred the similar abhayagiri stupa this done is equally impressive the engineering involved to construct this so long ago is mind blowing when one takes in the scale of the structure and the era if making it shows the feat and determination of the time the views of this ancient stupa was breathtaking and the surroundings were so serene this stupa is off the tourist track and from the hustle and bustle of loud tourists worth the visit when this stupa was built in the late third century ce it was the largest brick structure in the world and the third largest structure of any type exceeded only by a few pyramids in egypt consisting of over 90 million bricks it has come down in stature from 120 to 73 meters due to the loss of its spire jethawanaramaya stupa is located in the ruins of the jetavana monastery in the unesco world heritage city of anunadhapura it was the world s tallest stupa at 397 feet when built by king mahasena 273 391ad with the destruction and abandonment of the anuradhapura kingdom in the 1200s it was covered with jungle it was rebuilt in the 1300s and today stands at 233 feet jethawana sthupa excavation could be the largest excavation done by man up to date the height of the sthupa from the base rock foundation to the peak is 260ft which is higher than the pyramids of egypt the foundation is 670 ft by 670 ft at bedrock which is twice the dimension of a soccer field the depth of the excavation is 252ft which equal to a 25 story building for any person who is interested in ruins of ancient periods or conservations of olden architecture there is no better place than jethawanarama sthupa excavation we felt like this is the most significant ruins in anuradhapura compared to the rest of other ruins to think that this used to be among the tallest building in the world back back baaaack then it just simply put us in awe note that visitors need to remove their shoes or sandals to enter the area so if you barefoot during hot sunny day the walk will become very painful no joke so don t forget to bring and wear socks the stupa itself is not hollow so there s nothing else to do there other than walking around and observing the stupa with fascination 17 years old monk explained us hole story of buddha he was amazing calm mature such a great energy even he allowed us to take some photo this stupa is more than 120 metres high and quite incredible to look at even from a distance given that it contains so many bricks it shows a level of technological sophistication existed hundreds of years ago i observed many monkeys in and around this stupa the ancient wisdom of building dome shape from the unknown bare hands method always a big wow to witness one of largest stupa with widest base structures believed to host as large as 10 000 monks during that time this towering structure is the largest stupa in anuradhapura and demands a stop unfortunately my spouse and i experienced a heavy rain during our tour and we were unable to get good photos as such we did not get to see all that wished it was a nice visit to see the old stupa with devotees around it peaceful place to go around close to a small informative museum wonderful experience more than 93 million bricks third tallest monument in the world the first two being egyptian pyramids i prefer the brick stupa s to the white painted ones and this is perhaps the best example in sri lanka this stupa is huge and incredibly impressive limited what you can write about a stupa but they are an absolute must do in sri lanka as with all temples you must remove your shoes and dress appropriately be aware that the ground can get very hot indeed very good the stupa is one of the oldest in sri lanka and a place of importance to buddhists the building is old and very tall for the date it was built again it has to be among the biggest stupas in the anuradhapura area looks very old and is a nice place to sit around it was amazing and lovely moment with ithalian friends we went to mahavihara abhayagiriya and jethawanaramaya rv one of the largest dagaba sthupa in anuradhapura its always recommended to go in the night to have a superb view the floor is very hot in the sunny afternoon and if you are not a sri lankan you might find it difficult to walk on that heaty rock floor first we would like to say what we think the anuradhapura sacred precinct is and what it isn t it is not angkor wat we met lots of people that were slightly disappointed because they were expecting angkor wat scaled temples it is however very impressive in its own way especially if you use your imagination to envision what was once there and that thousands of monks once roamed around here apart from the stupa only the foundations of the monasteries are left because the buildings were wooden structures and rotted away centuries ago but the sheer size of the this complex and the other complexes makes it worth coming here details such as beautifully carved gnome like creatures animals and cobra kings provide delicate finishing touches of the monuments to enter the complex which includes 4 religious sites and the small museum was usd20 per person and an additional usd20 for a guide the first site is this stupa that dates from 300bc or thereabouts but actually it is almost 100 reconstructed yes it is big and made of fired bricks but it is not very exciting as expected it was shoes off at the steps and a quick look at the statues inside then it was time to visit the second stup complex and the oldest tree in the world visiting abhayagiri stupa was one of the most peaceful and spiritual highlights of my trip to sri lanka the site is incredibly historic dating back to the 1st century bc and once formed part of a massive monastery complex that housed thousands of monks despite its age the stupa still carries a sense of sacred silence that s deeply moving one charming and slightly surprising part of the visit was the number of monkeys roaming freely around the grounds they added a playful authentic touch to the experience definitely part of the charm just behind the main stupa we discovered eth pokuna also known as the elephant pond this ancient circular pond was once used by the monks for bathing and ritual purposes it s beautifully preserved and surrounded by nature a perfect place for quiet reflection if you love history spiritual places and meaningful travel this site is a must visit while exploring anuradhapura wear respectful clothing take your time and soak in the peaceful energy of this sacred place this is clearly one of the great brick built structures of the world and the effort that went into moulding baking and laying the countless millions boggles the mind restoration has not achieved the perfect curves that once must have impressed all who saw it but this is still an amazing sight huge dagoba or stupa which is free in the middle of an archeological site we arrived with bycicles and wandered a bit in the garden i do recommend to start with this one we did it in the end and were a bit tired to appreciate it fully there are several very famous stupas and this is the tallest it is visited by families children and visitors offering flowers and lighting incense a very popular place and a recommended visit situated in the sacred ancient city of anuradhapura this is said to be the ancient monument with the largest base area place can be easily accessed by a private vehicle good if you can visit the place in the evening to avoid the heat and sun light and it is very calm in the evening so you can enjoy a nice relaxing time this is very different from other stupas as it is made of brick and a visit is worth it and the nearby museum as many wonderful artefacts including jewellery and carvings visited here ina recent tour just before we saw the adjacent ruwanweli says stupa i have to say i enjoyed this one more the crowds were far smaller and you actually felt like you could sepnt some time alone with such an incredibly ancient monument a wonder of ancient engineering and a great place to consider your place in this world a huge stupa in anuradhapura which belongs to the atamasthana best to visit in morning or evening to avoid hot sun its a historical temple visited by both local and foreign tourist amazing sculptures and architectures built by great king mahasen deemed to be the biggest stupa of sri lanka reconstruction not yet completed and when it s completed it will higher than maha stupa ruwanweliseya visited in the evening very limited crowd can be seen most of the ancient works are still preserved as it is this is a buddhist sacred place so you need to wear appropriate clothes to visit the place the massive stupa remains in front of your eye for hours after the visit the broken top of the stupa has its own interesting story and the circumferential pradikshina roundabout is best attempted in the mornings or evenings when the sun is a good deal lower the weather can be intensely hot at times hence dress accordingly however do note that caps and hats are not allowed also women are expected to cover their shoulders and cover themselves below their knees together with its sister stupa this one offers some of the best preserved potions of the anuradhapura archaeological complex this is one of the core sites across a collection of ancient buddhist sites in anuradhapura we visited during school holidays and near a full moon so it was especially busy which made the experience that much more interesting not many foreigners but people were very friendly the entire complex is worth a visit and unlike anywhere else i ve been exploring the whole area on rented bicycles is a good way of getting around but it would be easy to explore by foot and tuktuk too a very impressive feat of building work not in the artificially pristine state of repair of some of the similar monuments this stupa was recovered from the jungle not very long ago there are boards showing it as it was with trees growing out of the brickwork and vegetation swamping the base as with all the religious sites in sl take your thick socks so you can walk around easily all of the ancient ruins in this area are very interesting the museum that starts the touring area is very informative lots of barefoot walking involved and much on hot ground you can t put this place in to words spiritual and enchanting this had our hearts very hot though no shoes or hats and must cover up i have travelled all over asia but the stupas and temples here in sri lanka are unique the size and mass and scale of jethawanaramaya is truly awe inspiring why this sight is not up there with the likes of the pyramids or angkor wat i don t know the size of the surrounding plaza makes it easy to step aside and be alone for a moment take time to sit away in a corner to soak this place up watch the locals worship just be try to hook in to a moment of spirituality surrounded by ancient ruins this site is easily accessible by car and should be incorporated into any tour but it s beauty is its simplicity so i am not sure a guide is necessary don t think about it go there anuradhapura has some amazing stupas and this is one of the best huge and lovely as it has not been replatered very peaceful with monkeys running up and down the sidws you must visit this place at dusk you get amazing feelings to your mind with the breeze and the surrounding you feel like you have lived there centuries ago a must visit place not much crowded a large sthupa almost identical size to ruwanwelisaya dagoba which is more popular and believed to be god is living there a perfect dagoba build long time ago perfect design and esthetic result is top move around don t forget to go according a clockwise way a not so well known fact is that jethawanaramaya was the 3rd tallest structure in the world after the great pyramids of giza up until 800 or so years ago and while not the tallest stupa in the world anymore it still is the largest in volume and supposedly 90 million baked bricks went into making it and when you re there it shows the base of the stupa is vast and even without two thirds of the top of the structure it still casts and imposing figure it truly is a marvelous feat of human engineering at the time of its creation this was the third largest structure in the world after the pyramids but even today its scale is impressive this was definitely my favourite part of my trip to anuradhapura it s one of two steps with exposed red brick and the result is quite different from the traditional buddhist stupas try visiting near sunset for a more vibrant view don t forget the ticket to the ancient ruins it can be purchased at the abaghiriya museum the price is steep at 3250lkr but the money goes towards maintaining these unesco cultural heritage sites we arrived at about 4 pm and we witnessed a prayer ceremonie with traditional trumpet play amazing impressive site apparantly according to our driver the ceremonie was rare and symbolised prayer to people to see the temples you need to pay a pass worth 3500 roepies a person only tourists pay this also known as uththararamaya it is the 4th largest manmade structure and the 2nd largest dhagoba in the world this stupa was not as popular as ruwanwelisaya however it was interesting to see how stupas are built as this one is exposed brick not covered in white like the rest of the big stupas in this town it is the big pagoda in anuradhapura they conserve this pagoda without painted as the pagoda is normally painted and gold plated it s fine all brick an interesting visit it was under construction with horrible heat it s in the middle of a park awesome and worth the trek but be warned wear simple footwear as you will need to remove both shoes and hats when going near the stupas or any sacred sites of which there are many the jetavanaramaya is a stupa located in the ruins of jetavana in the sacred world heritage city of anuradhapura which was also the ancient capital sri lanka it was completed at the beginning of 4th century ad a part of a sash or belt tied by the buddha is believed to be the relic that is enshrined here it is also significant in recorded history as one of the tallest structures in the ancient world the height of the stupa is 400 feet 122 m making it the tallest stupa in the ancient world approximately 93 3 million baked bricks were used in its construction conservation work has been funded by the income from ticket sales mainly to foreign tourists the entry fee for foreign tourists is quite high at rs 3750 per person as you are required to remove your shoes on a hot day you may not be able to walk around the stupa situated in the heritage city of anuradhapura jethawanaramaya is the tallest and largest stupa in the world height 400 feet built by king mahasen 276 303ac very quiet surroundings and nice breeze when you walk round the stupa there are some steps to climb before you can walk round but now there is a separate pathway for the disabled wheel chairs can be taken and feeble people to reach the stupa must visit ealry morning or in the evening to avoid the hot sun jethawanaramaya stupa is one of highest and biggest stupa in sri lankan it s an unbelievable creation jethawanaramaya is one of must visit place in the anuradhapura tour when we get there you feel big and proud about what the sri lankan king s did for buddhism this place need government attention and need to be looked after well jethawanaramaya stupa is the largest stupa in the world which is built by king mahasena 273 301 it is also considered to be the largest brick structure of the world by volume it is situated in world heritage city anuradhapura originally the stupa was 121 9m high but after several renovations by several kings it is only 70 7m high today it is estimated that more 93 million bricks have been used to built this giant stupa the stupa is a part of the jethawanaramaya monastery the remains of the monastery can still be seen around the stupa if you ever visit the place don t forget to see them especially the image house the building which the statue of lord buddha placed this stupa is believed to be the biggest brick built structure in the world and when you visit it you will be amazed at the size small of the bricks used in its construction it is an amazing sight this is the same thing yeah twice in tripadvisor once as stupa and once as dagoba oh well it was cool to see it very large impressive and fascinating ruins around it hghest stupa in the world initially it was a 400 feet in hight great king mahasen has constructed in first century ad archeological excavations reveal that the stupa has been built on a firm foundation from the mother rock of 28 feet from ground level specially treated baked bricks have been used to build the stupa with mixture of sand and lime for outer plaster really interesting part of the anuradhapura complex the sheer scale is amazing and as it s not rendered you can see how they were built it gives you a feel for how magnificent the site was in its heyday guys all these places are completely free of charge for foreigners too this is just a scam they are doing in this city when we arrived our taxi driver told us that we need to pay more than 3 thousand to go in these places and showed a ticket we believed him and decided not to go there since it was so expensive but later when we were walking near it we didn t see any tickets offices or anything like that we asked security guards there but they all said it was free so please don t pay any money when you go there it has almost the same buddhist statues you find in most buddhist places interesting only if your a devoted buddhist if not i would recommend you skip this place a reclining buddha inside part of the stupa s structures brighty painted and walls also people come inside to prey dress accordingly really worth a visit and walk around the stupa as well as around the grounds where archaeological work continues nothing religious about this but just big a major step back in time to see this brick tower rising from the jungle stepping of tonthe renovated stuba you then have a picture of a lost world and one refurbished and continuing as a place of worship so far this is the largest stupa i have seen its visible from quiet a distance from anurathapura the stupa shows how big the capital must have been and how rich was the state during jethawanaramaya s time we loved it also because it was the first stupa so large we saw for the first time and from where we started our tour to this rich old city of anuradhapura which is also famous for their moon stone and guard stone these stupas are interesting there may be a body in there or gold or jewellery shoes have to be taken off when visiting take socks to wear interesting place in good condition beautiful paintings showing the story of buddha and the kingdoms jetavana dagoba the jetavana dagoba stupa a unesco world heritage site is the highest brick built dagobah in the world founded by king mahasena 276 303 ac upon mahayana buddhism on the ruins of an old monatery when built with over 93 million bricks in 27 years it was the third tallest structure in the world after two pyramids of khufu khafra in giza cairo egypt originally its height was 397 feet and it was erected on land measuring 8 acres its diameter was more than 330 feet today it is 230 feet high and restoration work is in progress before wearing down of its pinnacle erosion of ground and burial of the base its height was 400 feet the jetavana monastery in its hey days housed bout 3000 monks it is one of the sixteen most sacred cultural destinations in anuradhapura this stupa is spectacular in size and construction it is amazing to think about first making all those bricks and then building this structure walking around this stupa i felt connected to the past don t forget to bring socks as the brick underfoot can get very warm as you make your way through the anuradhapura don t miss this stop from my blog in no time we were approaching the jethawanaramaya stupa an impressive structure in its own right though the lack of fresh clean white paint made the structure less impressive from a distance as i began to walk around it and fully take in its enormity i was finding it hard to believe that this was man made i ve seen the pyrimids in giza and the temples in cambodia and though both are jaw dropping in their own ways this structure held its own with the aforementioned best of them apparently if you took all the bricks that made up jethawanaramaya and stacked them 6 feet high you could build a wall from london to scotland or so my driver had led me to believe with that being said my driver said the same thing at abhayagiri dagoba the next morning at around 7 30 we explored the revered abhayagiriya stupa and its extensive archaeological site covering approximately 200 hectares workers were already busy on site amidst this vast ancient temple complex this is an indescribably large ancient temple complex from the moment we commenced trekking through the sunlit pathways amply covered by huge shady trees i was captivated by the rich history of ancient sri lanka every direction revealed the profound legacy embedded in each stone of this sacred area the whispers of centuries past echoed through rustling leaves reflecting the cultural heritage that flourished here a monumental testament to the architectural excellence of a bygone era as i stood in its shadow these are a hidden world of architectural marvels and cultural treasures waiting to be unearthed the remnants of the former weather beaten monasteries for more than 1000 of years though still convey a sense of grandeur the intricate carvings and sturdy stonework tell tales of devotion and artistry urging us to delve deeper into the narrative woven into the very fabric of the ruins abhayagiriya is one of the most captivating religious and archaeo logical sites in anuradhapura sri lanka s ancient capital the complex remains largely unexplored with only about a third of the existing structures uncovered in addition to the iconic massive stupa the site features bedeviled by picturesque ruins overgrown with tangled undergrowth apart of being a sacred edifice jethawanaramaya by far is the giant of all the stupas of the man made structures in the world it has been recorded that this edifice was only the third to pyramids and the tallest of all the stupas in the world rising to almost over 120 meters with the gradual weathering over the years and collapse apparently the height has reduced and what remains today is the outcome of the last restoration by another great sri lankan king parakramabahu in 12th century the stupa is conserved beautifully and reflects the engineering skills of the ancient sri lankan people an amazing level of architectural brilliance 120 metres high made from bricks and hundreds of years old in the process of being restored important buddhist monument the biggest stupa in sri lanka you really feel dwarfed in its presence the jethawanarama stupa has not been plastered or painted making it naturally majestic the vast area at the base of the stupa is very serene this place of worship isn t as crowded as places like sri maha bodhi or ruwanwaliseya stupa at night the base of the stupa has a calming ambience this is a place i visit everytime i am in anuradhapura definitely worth a visit it is a large brick stupa located in the middle of a park when i went it was in bad condition many of the bricks had fallen and even citizens were on the ground ripping out the weeds it s interesting to watch but i wasn t impressed awesome and a very sacred place relaxing mind and soul will be visiting again for sure really impressed and surprised seeing the greatest architecture let me first preface by saying anuradhapura is a long distance to travel from the main coastal resorts and so you should probably only consider if you are touring the island it was about a two hour drive from sigiriya the area is too big to cover on foot in a single day and whilst bicycles and tuktuks are easy and cheap to hire i would recommend a driver guide who can direct you to and provide commentary on the most significant sites the four main stupas jethawanaramaya jethavanarama rutwanwelisaya thuparama and abhayaagiri are all different you won t need more than 10 15 minutes at each unless you want to stay to worship we don t think there is any entrance charge we weren t asked for any money and there were no ticket checks as for all temples you must dress respectfully legs and shoulders covered you need to remove hats and shoes but you can wear socks which i would recommend as the stones underfoot can be hot and sharp of the four main stupas we liked jethawanaramaya jethavanarama the best at 400ft high with a 370ft diameter base on a 670ft square rock base this is the largest stupa in anuradpura and one of the tallest brick structures in the world it was built in the 3rd century the dome is unpainted it was very quiet and tranquil once part of a huge monastery and you can see the ruins all around it is worth visiting the museum where you can see a good collection of guardstones and ancient jewellery there is a clean toilet here too rutwanwelisaya has a massive white painted dome it is 180ft used to be twice that it is surrounded by wall with over 300 elephant sculptures but almost all these are restored or replacements it can get busy with devotees coming to pray thuparama is the smallest and oldest of the main stupas in anuradhapura what you see is mainly reconstructed its significance is that it is said to enshrine the collarbone of the buddha and as such there are lots of pilgrims actively worshipping a white dome surrounded by stone pillars which used to support a wooden cover see separate review of abhayaagiri its been said this sacred place was one of the great structures in the ancient world pyramids of giza fall into this category a large slab with a buddha imprint can be seen from one of the sides having been to dambulla caves this stupa just seemed too bright and over renovated admittedly we didn t have a guide but generally the temple site is pretty and worth a visit as part of the anuradhapura experience this was our first temple in the anuradhapura tour and it was particularly nice especially for the bright color of the buddha a really impressive piece of historic architecture absolutely put this on your list of places to visit whilst exploring the ruins and historic sites of anuradhapura stopped here on a quick visit to anuradhapura no ticket needed just drove up took shoes off and visited be careful the cement gets very hot not much info in english so read about it before visiting enjoy\n"
